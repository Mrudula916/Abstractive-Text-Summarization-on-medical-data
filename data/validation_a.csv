"CNecrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is one of the most serious gastrointestinal emergencies in  very low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm neonates  , affecting 7 - 14 % of these neonates . Due to the seriousness of the disease , prevention of NEC is the most important goal . Current evidence from systematic review and meta- analysis revealed that  probiotics  are the most promising intervention in reduction of the incidence of  NEC  in  VLBW neonates .  As per the evidence ,  prebiotics  modulate the composition of human intestine microflora to the benefit of the host by  suppression  of  colonization of harmful microorganism  and /or  the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth , decreased stool viscosity , reduced gastrointestinal transit time , and better feed tolerance .   Prebiotics  may be potential alternatives or adjunctive therapies to  probiotics  , despite a lack of evidence supporting its clinical  efficacy  in prevention  of NEC .  In this article , we discuss evidence -based physiological effects of  prebiotics  and its therapeutic role in prevention of NEC."

" The use of  AMS history  to guide prophylactic strategies for high-altitude ascent is not supported by the literature ; however , the low  sensitivity  and specificity of this diagnostic test could reflect the quality of the available studies . Ensuring that the characteristics of the history and future ascents are similar may improve the clinical utility of AMS history."
"sThe purpose of the current study was to clarify the role of the  quadriceps tendon ( QT ) autograft  for primary ACL reconstruction . Thus , a Bayesian network meta- analysis comparing  patients undergoing a  primary ACL reconstruction with QT versus patellar tendon ( PT ) and hamstring tendon ( HT ) autografts   was conducted . This Bayesian network meta- analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA extension statement for reporting systematic review s incorporating network meta-analyses of health care interventions . In January 2020 , the main data bases were accessed . Articles comparing the outcomes of the  QT autograft versus HT autograft and /or PT autograft  for primary ACL reconstruction were included in the present study . The statistical analysis was performed with STATA Software/MP , through a Bayesian hierarchical r and om-effect model analysis .  Data from a total of 2603 knees were analysed .  The overall mean follow-up was 35.0 months . Among the different grafts were evidence d comparable values of  IKDC , Tegner and Lysholm score .  The QT  autograft  detected comparable  rate of Lachman test > 3 mm  ,  Pivot shift test >  3 m and  instrumental laxity  > 3 mm . The QT  autograft  showed a  lower rate of autograft failure  above all . The QT  autograft  detected the  reduced rate of AKP  than the PT  .  Quadriceps tendon autograft may represent a feasible option for primary ACL reconstruction . These results must be interpret within the limitations of the present network meta-anlaysis."
"sOBJECTIVES to determine the effect of drugs with  anti-cholinergic properties  on relevant  health outcomes .  DESIGN electronic published and unpublished literature /trial registries were systematic ally review ed . Studies evaluating medications with anti-cholinergic activity on  cognitive function , delirium , physical function or mortality  were eligible . RESULTS  forty-six studies including 60,944 participants were included .  Seventy-seven percent of included studies evaluating  cognitive function  ( n = 33 ) reported a significant decline in  cognitive ability  with increasing anti-cholinergic load ( P < 0.05 ) . Four of five included studies reported no association with  delirium  and increasing anti-cholinergic drug load ( P > 0.05 ) . Five of the eight included studies reported a decline  in physical function  in users of anti-cholinergics ( P < 0.05 ) . Three of nine studies evaluating  mortality  reported that the use of drugs with anti-cholinergic properties was associated with a trend towards increased  mortality  , but this was not statistically significant . The method ological quality of the evidence -base ranged from poor to very good .  medicines with anti-cholinergic properties have a significant adverse effect on  cognitive and physical function  , but limited evidence exists for  delirium  or  mortality  outcomes."
" This systematic review suggests that supplementation with  phytonadione and menaquinone-4  reduces  bone loss .  In the case of the latter , there is a strong effect on incident fractures among Japanese patients."
"nA systematic review of r and  omised  controlled trials was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of   workplace interventions   to  prevent  low back pain .   Potential trials were located by a computerised search supplemented with citation tracking . The method ological quality of the trials was assessed on 11 criteria and the level of evidence for each intervention was determined , based upon the amount , consistency and quality of evidence from the trials . The review located  13 trials that were  generally  of moderate quality .  The trials suggest that  work place exercise  is effective , braces and education are ineffective , and  workplace modification plus education  is of unknown value in preventing low back pain."
"dMaternal obesity is associated with increased risk of  pregnancy complications  such as  gestational diabetes , stillbirth , preterm birth , and congenital malformations .  While small studies have looked into the effect of prepregnancy  bariatric surgery  on gestational diabetes , these studies have been inconclusive and have not considered presurgery body mass index ( BMI ) as a confounder . Some systematic review s have found a lower risk of neonatal complications after  bariatric surgery  but included heterogeneous studies with small sample sizes . Taking presurgery BMI into account , this study aims to investigate the risks of adverse perinatal outcomes including gestational diabetes in  womenwho have had  bariatric surgery  versus women who have not .  This population -based study used data from  Swedish registries nationwide  , which include prenatal , obstetric , and neonatal records . Of  627,693 singleton pregnancies between 2006 and 2011 , 670 were in women who had undergone  bariatric surgery  with presurgery weight documented . Up to 5 control pregnancies in obese women  were matched for BMI , age , level of education , years , and smoking history for each pregnancy in the intervention cohort . For controls , weight during early pregnancy was used to calculate BMI . For the study group , BMI was calculated with weight and height measurements at the time of surgery . Outcomes included  gestational diabetes , low birth weight , macrosomia , stillbirth , large and small-for-gestational-age , preterm birth , neonatal death , and major congenital malformations detected during the first year of life . Gestational diabetes  was diagnosed by a  2-hour plasma glucose level  of 10.0 mmol/L or higher during a glucose tolerance test ( with a 75-g loading dose ) or a fasting plasma glucose level of 7.0 mmol/L or higher . In the study , 1.9 % of the postsurgery pregnancies versus 6.8 % of the control pregnancies had  gestational diabetes  ( odds ratio , 0.25 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.13–0.47 ; P < 0.001 ; Table 2 ) . The  median gestation time  of the diagnosis was 32 weeks for both groups , considering women for whom the diagnosis date was available . The surgery cohort , compared with controls , was associated with an increased  risk of small-for-gestational-age infants  ( 15.6 % vs 7.6 % ; odds ratio , 2.20 ; 95 % Health , Inc. All rights reserved . 376 Obstetrical and Gynecological Survey CI , 1.64–2.95;P < 0.001 ) and increased risk  for low birth weight  , although that was not statistically significant ( 6.8 % vs 4.5 % ; odds ratio , 1.34 ; 95 % CI , 0.88–2.04 ; P = 0.17 ) . Alternatively , the surgery group had a  lower risk for large-for-gestational-age infants  compared with the control group ( 8.6 % vs 22.4 % ; odds ratio , 0.33 ; 95 % CI , 0.24–0.44 ; P < 0.001 ) and  lower  risk of  macrosomia  ( 1.2 % vs 9.5 % ; odds ratio , 0.11 ; 95 % CI , 0.05–0.24 ; P < 0.001 ) . There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms  of risk of preterm birth  ( 10.0 % vs 7.5 % ; odds ratio , 1.28 ; 95 % CI , 0.92–1.78 ; P =  0.15  ) ,  nor  in  terms of congenital malformations  . One limitation of this study was that nearly all ( 98 % ) of the surgery procedures were  gastric bypass surgery  , so it is not clear as to whether these findings apply to other types of  bariatric surgery .  While the study found that  bariatric surgery  was associated with  reduced risks of large-for-gestational-age infants as well as gestational diabetes  ,  bariatric surgery  was also associated with increased  odds of small-for-gestational age infants  , so increased attention during these pregnancies is recommended."
"DBackground . A number of studies have computed the  minimally important difference ( MID )  for health-related quality of life instruments . Objective . To determine whether there is consistency in the magnitude of  MID estimates  from different instruments . Methods . We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that computed an MID and contained sufficient information to compute an effect size ( ES ) .  Thirty-eight studies fulfilled the criteria , result ing in 62 ESs .  Results . For all but 6 studies , the  MID estimates  were close to one half a SD ( mean = 0.495 , SD = 0.155 ) . There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the  number of response options .  Negative changes were not associated with larger  ESs .  Population -based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with  smaller ESs  , and acute conditions with  larger ESs .  An explanation for this consistency is that research in psychology has shown that the limit of people ’s ability to discriminate over a wide range of tasks is approximately 1 part in 7 , which is very close to half a SD . Conclusion . In most circumstances , the threshold of discrimination for  changes in health-related quality of life  for chronic diseases appears to be approximately half a SD."
"sMany aspects of long-term  pharmacological treatments  for   anxiety disorders  ( AnxDs )  are still debated . We undertook an up date d systematic review of long-term pharmacological studies on panic disorder ( PD ) , generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , and social  anxiety disorder ( SAD ) .  Relevant studies  dating from January 1 , 2012 to August 31 , 2015  were identified using the PubMed data base and a review of bibliographies . Of  372 records identified in the search , five studies on PD and 15 on GAD were included in the review .  No studies on SAD were found . Our review confirms the usefulness of long-term pharmacological treatments for PD and GAD and suggests that they can provide further improvement over that obtained during short-term therapy .  Paroxetine , escitalopram , and clonazepam  can be  effective  for long-term treatment of PD . However , further studies are needed to draw conclusions about the long-term benzodiazepine use in PD , particularly for the possible  cognitive side-effects over time .   Pregabalin and quetiapine  can be  effective  for long-term treatment of  GAD  , while preliminary suggestions emerged for  agomelatine  and  vortioxetine .  We did not find any evidence for determining the optimal length and /or dosage of medications to minimize the  relapse risk .  Few investigations have attempted to identify potential predictors of long-term treatment response . Personalized treatments for AnxDs can be implemented using predictive tools to explore those factors affecting treatment response/tolerability heterogeneity , including neurobiological functions/ clinical profiles , comorbidity , biomarkers , and genetic features , and to tailor medications according to each patient ’s unique features."
"sThis study aim ed to investigate whether   atrial fibrillation  ( AF )  predicts  myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ) or cardiovascular ( CV ) death .  AF is a well-established risk factor for thrombotic stroke and all-cause mortality . PubMed , EmBase , and Cochrane Central were search ed for articles comparing the incidence  rates of  MI , CV death  , or  CV events  between  AF and non-AF  patients .   Relative risk ratio ( RR )  was used as effect estimate . Crude and adjusted  RRs  were calculated . Data were pooled using a r and om-effects model . The  meta- analysis included 27 studies .  In the unadjusted analysis , AF patients had a nonsignificant trend toward a higher  risk of MI  compared with non-AF patients ; however , a significant association was found . The crude data analysis showed that AF was associated with increased  risk of CV death  ( P < 0.05 ) and  CV events  ( P < 0.05 ) . These associations remained significant after pooling data from adjusted models ( CV death : RR = 1.95 , 95 % CI 1.51–2.51 , P < 0.05 ; CV events : RR = 2.10 , 95 % CI 1.50–2.95 , P < 0.05 ) . These results showed that AF is an independent risk factor for MI , CV death , and CV events."
 We found the strongest evidence for spillovers from vaccines and mass drug administration to control infectious disease . There was little high quality evidence of spillovers for other interventions.
"  Information technology strategies  combined with the other elements of chronic care  models  are associated with  improved glycemic control  in  people with diabetes .  No clinical ly relevant impact was observed on  low-density lipoprotein levels and blood pressure  , but there was evidence that the cost of care was lower."
"eIMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD Cobalamin ( vitamin B12 ) deficiency is particularly common in the  elderly ( > 15 % )  . Management of cobalamin deficiency with  cobalamin injections  is well codified at present , but new routes of  cobalamin  administration ( oral and nasal ) are being studied , especially oral  cobalamin  therapy for food-cobalamin malabsorption . AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW The objective of this review is to evaluate the  efficacy of  oral cobalamin  treatment  in  elderly patients .  To reach this objective , PubMed data were systematic ally search ed for  English and French articles published from January 1990 to July 2008 .  Data from our research group on cobalamin deficiency ( Groupe d'Etude des CAREnce vitamine B12 - CARE B12 ) were also analyzed . WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN Three prospect i ve r and omized studies , a systematic review by the Cochrane group and five prospect i ve cohort studies were found and provide evidence that  oral cobalamin treatment  may adequately treat cobalamin deficiency . The  efficacy  was particularly highlighted when looking at the marked improvement in  serum vitamin B12 levels and hematological parameters  , for example  hemoglobin level , mean erythrocyte cell volume and reticulocyte count .  The  effect  of  oral cobalamin treatment  in  patients  presenting with  severe neurological manifestations  has not yet been adequately documented .  Oral cobalamin treatment  avoids the  discomfort , inconvenience and cost  of monthly injections . TAKE HOME MESSAGE Our experience and the present analysis support the use of  oral cobalamin therapy  in clinical practice."
"eThe purpose of this article is to disseminate the  st and ard of antiemetic therapy  for  Japanese clinical oncologists .  On the basis of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument , which reflects evidence -based clinical practice guidelines , a working group of the Japanese Society of Clinical Oncology ( JSCO ) review ed clinical practice guidelines for antiemesis and performed a systematic review of evidence -based domestic practice guidelines for  antiemetic therapy  in Japan . In addition , because health-insurance systems in Japan are different from those in other countries , a consensus was reached regarding  st and ard treatments for chemotherapy  that induce nausea and vomiting . Current evidence was collected by use of MEDLINE , from material s from meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology National Comprehensive Cancer Network , and from European Society of Medical Oncology/Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer guidelines for antiemesis . Initially , 21 clinical questions ( CQ ) were selected on the basis of CQs from other guidelines .  Patients treated with highly emetic agents  should receive a  serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5HT3 ) receptor antagonist , dexamethasone , and a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist .  For  patients with moderate emetic risk  ,  5HT3 receptor antagonists  and  dexamethasone  were recommended , whereas for  those receiving chemotherapy with low emetic risk   dexamethasone  only is recommended .  Patients receiving high-emetic-risk radiation  therapy   should also receive a  5HT3 receptor antagonist .  In this paper the 2010 JSCO clinical practice guidelines for antiemesis are presented in English ; they reveal high concordance of Japanese medical circumstances with other antiemetic guidelines that are similarly based on evidence."
" Based on the available trials , the evidence does not support the administration of oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of  NEC .  There are no r and omized controlled trials of  oral IgA  alone for the prevention of NEC."
" From this review , it was found that some outcome measures of such  non-drug  interventions still required further studies . Future studies should use vali date d instruments to assess the outcomes , with focus on common definitions of interventions and outcome measures , more intensive one-to-one interventions , appropriate control groups , adequate r and omization procedures , and also provide information on effect size."
"SBackground Much research has been undertaken to establish the important benefits of  physical activity  in  persons with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .  There is disagreement regarding the strength of this research , perhaps because the majority of studies on  physical activity  and its benefits have not undergone initial and systematic feasibility testing . We aim to address the feasibility processes that have been examined within the context of  physical activity interventions  in MS . Method A systematic scoping review was conducted based on a literature search of five data bases to identify feasibility processes described in preliminary studies of  physical activity  in MS . We read and extracted methodology from each study based on the following  feasibility metrics : process (  e.g.  recruitment )  ,  re source (  e.g.  monetary costs )  ,  management (  e.g.  personnel time requirements )  and  scientific outcomes  ( e.g.  clinical /participant reported outcome measures )  . We illustrate the use of the four  feasibility  metrics within a r and omised controlled trial of a  home-based exercise intervention  in  persons with MS .  Results  Twenty-five studies were identified .   Re source feasibility  ( e.g.  time and re sources )  and  scientific outcomes feasibility  ( e.g.  clinical outcomes )  method ologies were applied and described in many studies ; however , these metrics have not been systematic ally addressed . Metrics related to  process feasibility ( e.g. recruitment )  and  management feasibility ( e.g. human and data management )  are not well described within the literature . Our case study successfully enabled us to address the four  feasibility metrics  , and we provide new information on  management feasibility  ( i.e. estimate data completeness and  estimate data entry )  and  scientific outcomes feasibility  ( i.e. determining data collection material s appropriateness ) . Conclusion Our review highlights the existing research and provides a case study which assesses important metrics of study feasibility . This review serves as a clarion call for feasibility trials that will substantially strengthen the foundation of research on exercise in MS."
" We found limited evidence supporting the high prevalence of  active and latent MTrPs  in  patients with neck or shoulder disorders .  Point prevalence estimates of  MTrPs  were based on a small number of studies with very low sample sizes and with design limitations that increased risk of bias within included studies . Future studies , with low risk of bias and large sample sizes may impact on current evidence."
"yBackground  Resistant starch ( RS )  is a starch that can be fermented by the microbial flora within gut lumen . Insulin resistance ( IR ) is a pathophysiological condition related to diabetes and obesity .  RS  could reduce  blood glucose  and ameliorate IR in animals , but its effect in human population is controversial . Objective The authors conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the effect of  RS diet supplement  on ameliorating IR in  patients with T2DM and simple obesity .  Methods Data bases that supplemented with  RS  in ameliorating IR in T2DM and simple obesity were queried for studies on or before August 15 , 2018 . Parameters including  fasting insulin , fasting glucose , body mass index ( BMI ) , homeostatic model assessment ( HOMA )  etc . were extracted from studies to systemically evaluate effects of  RS .  Results The data base search yielded 14 parallel or crossover studies that met the inclusion criteria . The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the amelioration  of BMI , HOMA-%S and HOMA-%B  in T2DM patients between  RS  and the  non-RS  supplementation . However , the  fasting blood glucose , fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in  T2DM with obesity who supplemented  RS  were lower than control group , and the subgroup analysis according to the dose of  RS  supplementation was inconsistency . There was no significant difference between  RS  and  non-RS  supplements in  patients  with simple  obesity  . Conclusion  RS supplementation  can ameliorate IR in T2DM , especially for the  patients of T2DM with obesity  , but not in simple obesity."
"6Animal and human observational studies suggest that iron deficiency impairs physical  exercise  performance , but findings from r and omized trials on the effects of iron are equivocal . Iron deficiency and anemia are especially common in  women of reproductive age ( WRA ) .  Clear evidence of benefit from  iron supplementation  would inform clinical and public health guidelines . Therefore , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to determine the effect of  iron supplementation  compared  with control  on exercise performance in WRA . We search ed the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials , MEDLINE , Scopus ( comprising Embase and MEDLINE ) , WHO regional data bases , and other sources in July 2013 . R and omized controlled trials that measured  exercise  outcomes in  WRA  r and omized to daily  oral iron supplementation vs. control  were eligible . R and om-effects meta- analysis was used to  calculate mean differences ( MDs ) and st and ardized MDs ( SMDs )  . Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool .  Of 6757 titles screened , 24 eligible studies were identified  , 22 of which contained  extractable data  . Only 3 studies were at overall low risk of bias  . Iron supplementation   improved both maximal exercise performance  , demonstrated by an  increase in maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max )  [ for relative VO2 max , MD : 2.35 mL/(kg ⋅ min ) ; 95 % CI : 0.82 , 3.88 ; P = 0.003 , 18 studies ; for absolute VO2 max , MD : 0.11 L/min ; 95 % CI : 0.03 , 0.20 ; P = 0.01 , 9 studies ; for overall VO2 max , SMD : 0.37 ; 95 % CI : 0.11 , 0.62 ; P = 0.005 , 20  studies ] , and submaximal exercise performance  , demonstrated by a  lower heart  rate ( MD : -4.05 beats per minute ; 95 % CI : -7.25 , -0.85 ; P = 0.01 , 6 studies )  and proportion of VO2  max ( MD : -2.68 % ; 95 % CI : -4.94 , -0.41 ; P = 0.02 , 6 studies ) required to achieve defined workloads  . Daily iron supplementation  significantly  improves maximal and submaximal exercise performance  in WRA , providing a rationale to prevent and treat iron deficiency in this group . This trial was registered with PROSPERO ( http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ PROSPERO / prospero .asp ) as CRD42013005166."
  Fibromyalgia patients  experience symptoms that may be alleviated  by mindfulness interventions  . Baseline values for  the observe  subscale of  the  FFMQ were unexpectedly high . Further research is needed to know if this may be due to non-mindful observations and should be noted when the FFMQ is used in fibromyalgia clinical trials.
"DAcademic improvement is amongst the most common treatment targets when prescribing stimulants to  children with ADHD .  Previous review s on stimulant-related academic improvements are inconclusive and focus on task engagement . Recent literature suggests outcome -domain-specific medication effects that are larger for productivity than for  accuracy  . The aims of this study are quantifying  methylpheni date  effects on  academic productivity and accuracy  for math , reading , spelling ; exploring the mediating or moderating effects of symptom improvements , demographic- , design - and disorder-related variables . PubMed , EMBASE , ERIC and PsycINFO were search ed for articles reporting  methylpheni date  effects on  academic productivity and accuracy .   Thirty-four studies met entry criteria .   Methylpheni date  improved  math productivity  ( 7.8 % increase , p < .001 ) ;  math accuracy  ( 3.0 % increase , p = .001 ) ; increased  reading speed  ( SMD .47 , p < .001 ) but not  reading accuracy .  None of the mediators or moderators tested affected  methylpheni date  efficacy .  Academic improvements  were small compared to symptom improvements ; qualitative changes limited to math  .  Clinicians should take this discrepancy into account when prescribing medication for ADHD."
"yPatients  with Turner syndrome  have adverse  bone  and  cardiovascular  outcomes from chronic estrogen deficiency . Hence , long-term  estrogen replacement therapy  is the cornerstone treatment . The estimates of its effect and optimal use , however , remain uncertain . We aim ed to summarize the benefits and harms of  estrogen replacement therapy  on  bone , cardiovascular , vasomotor and quality of life outcomes  in  patients with Turner syndrome .  A comprehensive search of four data bases was performed from inception through January 2016 . R and  omized  clinical trials and observational cohort studies study ing the effect of  estrogen replacement therapy  in  patients with Turner syndrome under the age of 40  were included . Independently and in duplicate review ers selected studies , extracted data and assessed  risk of  bias . Subgroup analyses were based on route of administration and type of estrogen formulation .  Twenty-five studies at moderate to high  risk of  bias ( 12 r and omized trials , 13 cohort studies ) with 771 patients were included .  Using r and om-effects models ,  estrogen replacement therapy  showed an increase  in bone mineral density  [ weighted mean change from baseline 0.09 g/cm2 ( 0.04–0.14 ) ] that differed by type of estrogen but not route of administration .  Oral estrogen replacement therapy  showed a higher increase  in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  when compared to transdermal [ weighted mean difference 9.33 mg/dl ( 4.82–13.85 ) ] with no significant effect on other lipid fractions . The current evidence suggests possible benefit  of estrogen replacement therapy   on bone mineral density and high density lipoprotein cholesterol .  Whether this improvement translates into changes in patient important outcomes  ( cardiovascular events or fractures )  remains uncertain . Larger r and omized clinical trials with direct comparisons on patient important outcomes are necessary."
" Multiple site pain , high pain severity , older age , baseline disability and longer  pain  duration were identified as potential prognostic factors for disability across pain sites . There was limited evidence that anxiety and depression were associated  with  disability in  patients with subacute pain  , indicating that these factors may not play as large a role as expected in developing disability due to a pain condition . Quality of evidence was moderate , low or very low , implying that confidence in the results is limited . Large prospect i ve prognostic factor studies are needed with sufficient study population s and transparent reporting of all factors examined . Trial registration number CRD42014008914."

Future well-powered prospect i ve longitudinal studies are deemed necessary to confirm the conclusions of this review."
"eOBJECTIVE The main objective of this study was to systematic ally review all the scientific studies that analyse the effectiveness of  mud pack therapy  on  patients diagnosed with knee OA .  METHODS  One hundred and fifteen publications were identified  through  an electronic and manual  search and 20 of those  studies  were chosen based on the inclusion criteria : r and omized clinical trials , systematic review s or meta-analyses whose objective was to analyse the effect  of  mud pack therapy   on  perceived pain , function and quality of life  ,  with a sample size of ≥20 subjects , published since 2000 and showing conclusive results .  RESULTS In the studies that met the inclusion criteria , 12  analyse functionality  , 17  perceived pain  , 5  quality of life  and all showed a significant improvement in the  three analysed variables  . The method ological quality of the studies had a moderate risk of bias .   Mud pack therapy  is considered an alternative and effective therapy in the clinical management of knee OA . Studies with better methodology are needed to prove its scope."
"sDespite the high morbidity and mortality associated with  bipolar depression  , the optimal treatment for this phase is still a matter of debate . The aim of the current review was to provide up date d evidence about the  efficacy and tolerability  of  anticonvulsants  in the treatment of  acute bipolar depression .  A comprehensive review of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the use of  anticonvulsants  for the  treatment of acute bipolar depression up to June 2011  was conducted by means of the PubMed - Medline data base . Eligibility criteria included  active comparator-controlled or  placebo-controlled  r and omized studies involving  monotherapy  or  combination therapy .  A total of 18 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria .  Studies supported the efficacy of  divalproex  as monotherapy in acute bipolar  depression  but small sample size was a common method ological limitation . Findings were inconclusive for  lamotrigine  and  carbamazepine  although overall lamotrigine may have a beneficial but modest effect . Negative results were found for  levetiracetam and gabapentin  but the evidence base on these agents is scant . All  anticonvulsants were generally well tolerated .  No double-blind RCTs were found for the use of other anticonvulsants such as  oxcarbazepine , licarbazepine , zonisamide , retigabine , pregabalin , tiagabine , felbamate and vigabatrine  in the acute treatment of bipolar depression . To sum up , taking into consideration the  efficacy and tolerability profiles  of anticonvulsants , current evidence supports the use of  divalproex and lamotrigine  in the treatment of acute bipolar depression . However , available data for most other anticonvulsants are inconclusive and further RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed before drawing firm conclusions."
">Context  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD )  is a highly prevalent and underdiagnosed comorbidity of many chronic diseases that is associated with altered intestinal bacterial communities . This association has prompted research into alternative treatments aim ed at modulating intestinal microbiota . Given the novelty of these treatments , scarce evidence regarding their effectiveness in clinical population s exists . Objective This meta- analysis sought to systemically review and quantitatively synthesize evidence on  prebiotic , probiotic , and synbiotic therapies  for  patients with NAFLD  in r and omized controlled trials . Data sources PRISMA guidelines ensured transparent reporting of evidence . PICOS criteria defined the research question for the systematic review . A systematic keyword search in PubMed and EMBASE identified  25 studies : 9   assessed prebiotic  , 11  assessed probiotic  , and  7   assessed symbiotic  therapies  for a total of 1309 patients .  Data extraction Basic population characteristics , the primary variables  of aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT )  ( utilized for NAFLD diagnosis ) , and the secondary variables  of body mass index ( BMI ) , gamma-glutamyl transferase ( γ-GT ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-c ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-c ) , and triglyceridges ( TAG )  were extracted . Pooled effect sizes of these variables were calculated by meta- analysis . No publication bias was identified using Begg 's and Egger 's tests or Cochrane bias assessment tool . Results Meta- analysis indicated  that microbial therapies   significantly reduced BMI  ( -0.37 kg/m2 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -0.46 to -0.28 ;  P  <  0.001 ) , hepatic  enzymes ( ALT , -6.9 U/L [ 95%CI , -9.4 to -4.3 ] ; AST , -4.6 U/L [ 95%CI , -6.6 to -2.7 ] ; γ-GT , -7.9 U/L [ 95%CI , -11.4 to -4.4 ] ;  P < 0.001 ) , serum cholesterol  ( -10.1 mg/dL 95%CI , -13.6 to -6.6 ;  P < 0.001 ) , LDL-c  ( -4.5 mg/dL ; 95%CI , -8.9 to -0.17 ;  P < 0.001 ) , and  TAG ( -10.1 mg/dL ; 95%CI , -18.0 to  -2.3  ;  P < 0.001 )  ,  but not  inflammation ( TNF-α , -2.0 ng/mL ; [ 95%CI , -4.7 to 0.61 ] ; CRP , -0.74 mg/L [ 95%CI , -1.9 to 0.37 ] ) . Subgroup analysis by treatment category indicated  similar effects  of  prebiotics and   probiotics on BMI and liver enzymes but not total cholesterol , HDL-c , and LDL-c  . Conclusion This meta- analysis supports the potential use  of microbial therapies  in the treatment of NAFLD and sheds light on their potential mode of action . Further research into these treatments should consider the limitations of biomarkers currently used for the diagnosis and progression of NAFLD , in addition to the inherent challenges of  personalized microbial-based therapies ."
"nPurpose Our aim was to assess the efficacy of  metformin  for  weight loss  in  overweight and obese people  through a systematic review and network meta- analysis and to identify the most suitable dosage and intervention period for using  metformin   in adolescents and adults .  Methods We search ed data bases for studies published by April 2018 . A total of  34 trials ( 44 analyses ) involving 8461 participants and 16 intervention arms were eligible .  The study was registered with PROSPERO International prospect i ve register of systematic review s ( CRD42017081053 ) . Results  Metformin  was found to significantly decrease  body mass index percentile ( BMI )  and had a tendency to decrease  BMI  ( kg/m2 ) and  weight  ( kg ) . Significant  efficacy  was observed in many subgroups . The metaregression may have identified the causes of heterogeneity as  metformin  dosage , control type , and intervention period . Network meta- analysis revealed that in  adolescents  , intervention with 2000 mg/day  metformin  ranked better than other interventions ; however , 1000 mg/day  metformin  for 3 months may be most suitable for adolescents . For adults ,  metformin  at doses of 3000 and 1000 mg/day ranked the highest , other than minimeal and lifestyle interventions ; moreover , intervention with 3000 mg/day for 6 months and 1000 mg/day for 0.5 months may be suitable for adults . Conclusion When considering the efficacy of interventions for  losing weight  ,  metformin  offers clear advantages for overweight and obese population."
"tINTRODUCTION  Fall risk screening tools  are frequently used as a part of  falls prevention programs in hospitals .  Design -related bias in evaluations of tool predictive accuracy could lead to overoptimistic results , which would then contribute to program failure in practice . METHODS A systematic review was undertaken . Two blind review ers assessed the methodology of relevant publications into a four-point classification system adapted from multiple sources . The association between study design classification and reported results was examined using linear regression with clustering based on screening tool and robust variance estimates with point estimates of Youden Index (= sensitivity + specificity - 1 ) as the dependent variable . Meta- analysis was then performed pooling data from prospect i ve studies . RESULTS  Thirty-five publications met inclusion criteria , containing 51 evaluations of  fall risk screening tools .   Twenty evaluations were classified as  retrospective validation evaluations  , 11 as  prospect i ve ( temporal ) validation evaluations  , and 20 as  prospect i ve ( external ) validation evaluations .  Retrospective evaluations had significantly higher  Youden Indices  ( point estimate [ 95 % confidence interval ] : 0.22 [ 0.11 , 0.33 ] ) .  Pooled Youden Indices  from prospect i ve evaluations demonstrated the STRATIFY ,  Morse Falls Scale  , and nursing staff clinical judgment to have comparable accuracy . DISCUSSION Practitioners should exercise caution in comparing validity of fall risk assessment tools where the evaluation has been limited to retrospective classifications of methodology . Heterogeneity between studies indicates that the Morse Falls Scale and STRATIFY may still be useful in particular setting s , but that widespread adoption of either is unlikely to generate benefits significantly greater than that of nursing staff clinical judgment."

" The preference for  cementless acetabular components  on the basis of improved  survivorship  is not supported by the published evidence . Although concerns regarding aseptic loosening of cemented acetabular components may have led North American surgeons toward the nearly exclusive use of  cementless acetabular components  , the available literature suggests that the fixation of  cemented acetabular components  is more reliable than that of  cementless components  beyond the first postoperative decade."
"sBACKGROUND Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain , tenderness at muscle and tendon insertions point when digital pressure is applied , sleep disorders , chronic fatigue , depressive episodes , anxiety , and other functional somatic syndromes . OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine whether  balneotherapy with mineral waters and mineral-water containing mud  is effective in the management of   fibromyalgia .   METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding  spa therapy  in the treatment of the   fibromyalgia .   We search ed many data bases for articles published between 2000  and 2012  and we selected  7 studies among 65 articles retrieved .  A  total of 142 patients received  balneotherapy  and 129 were  controls .    Study data confirms that  spa therapy  could improve the symptoms of  fibromyalgia  including pain , depression and minor symptoms."
"tIn  low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs )  , naturally occurring social networks may be particularly vital to health outcomes as extended webs of social ties often are the principal source of various re sources . Underst and ing how social network structure , and influential individuals within the network , may amplify the effects of interventions in LMICs , by creating , for example , cascade effects to non-targeted participants , presents an opportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health interventions in such setting s. We conducted a systematic review of PubMed , Econlit , Sociological Abstract s , and PsycINFO to identify a  sample of 17  sociocentric network  papers ( arising from 10 studies ) that specifically examined health issues in LMICs .  We also separately selected to review   19 sociocentric network papers  ( arising from 10 other studies ) on development topics related to wellbeing in LMICs .  First , to provide a method ological re source , we discuss the  sociocentric network study design  s employed in the selected papers , and then provide a catalog of 105 name generator questions used to measure social ties across all the  LMIC network  papers ( including both ego- and sociocentric network papers ) cited in this review . Second , we show that  network composition , individual network central ity , and network structure  are associated with important health behaviors and health and development outcomes in different context s across multiple levels of analysis and across distinct network types . Lastly , we highlight the opportunities for health research ers and practitioners in LMICs to 1 ) design effective studies and interventions in LMICs that account for the sociocentric network positions of certain individuals and overall network structure , 2 ) measure the  spread of outcomes or intervention externalities  , and 3 ) enhance the  effectiveness and efficiency of aid  based on knowledge of social structure . In summary , human health and wellbeing are connected through complex webs of dynamic social relationships . Harnessing such information may be especially important in context s where re sources are limited and people depend on their direct and indirect connections for support."
"RPurpose - We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses to evaluate the early and long-term migration patterns of   tibial components of TKR  of all known RSA studies .  Methods - Migration pattern was defined as at least 2 postoperative RSA follow-up moments .  Maximal total point motion ( MTPM )  at 6 weeks , 3 months , 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 5 years , and 10 years were considered . Results - The  literature  search  yielded 1,167 hits of which 53 studies were included , comprising 111 study groups and 2,470 knees .  The majority of the early  migration  occurred in the first 6 months postoperatively followed by a period of stability , i.e. , no or very little migration .  Cemented and uncemented tibial components  had different  migration patterns .  For  cemented  tibial components there was no difference in  migration  between  all-poly  and  metal-backed  components , between mobile bearing and fixed bearing , between cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized . Furthermore ,  no difference  existed between  TKR measured with  model-based RSA  or  marker-based RSA  methods .  For uncemented TKR there was some variation in  migration  with the highest migration for uncoated TKR . Interpretation - The results from this meta- analysis on   RSA migration of TKR   are in line with both the survival analyses results from joint registries of these TKRs as well as revision rates results from meta-analyses , thus providing further proof for the association between early  migration  and  late revision for loosening .  The pooled migration patterns can be used both as benchmarks and for defining migration thresholds for future evaluation of new TKR."
"tINTRODUCTION The treatment strategy for  appendiceal mass  is controversial , ranging from  operation  or  image-guided drainage  to  conservative treatment with or without antibiotics .  The aim of this study was to assess the various treatment modalities with respect to  complications  and  treatment failure .  METHODS The analysis was based on the principles of a qualitative systematic review . The literature was search ed in PubMed for the period  from 1966  to March 2014 . The articles were review ed with respect to complications , treatment failure and hospital stay . Papers on post-operative intra-abdominal abscesses and abscesses of any cause other than appendicitis were excluded as were also studies only describing recurrent appendicitis and /or interval appendectomy . Sub-analyses were performed in  children  ,  adults  , and in  mixed population  s. RESULTS  A total of 48 studies were found eligible ; they included in total 3,772 patients .  Operation for appendiceal mass was beset with a moderate to high risk  of complications  of up to 57 % and a risk of  intestinal resection  of up to 25 % .  Major complications  were observed in up to 18 % of cases . Conservative  treatment with or without antibiotics  was associated with a  treatment failure rate  of 8 - 15 % . Drainage was beset with a risk  of complications  of 2 - 15 % and a  risk of treatment failure  of 2 - 13 % .  Operation with appendectomy for  appendiceal  mass carries a high risk of complications compared with conservative treatment or drainage . Drainage may lower the risk of  treatment failure  but entails a risk of complications . Based on the best evidence , we propose a step-down treatment strategy . FUNDING Not relevant .

"sABSTRACT Introduction : Results of previous clinical trials evaluating the effect of   resveratrol supplementation  on  blood pressure ( BP )   are controversial . Purpose : We aim ed to assess the impact of  resveratrol  on  BP  through systematic review of literature and meta- analysis of available r and omized , controlled clinical trials ( RCTs ) . Methods : Literature search included SCOPUS , PubMed - Medline , ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar data bases up to 17th October 2017 to identify RCTs investigating the impact of  resveratrol  on  BP  . Two review authors independently extracted data on study characteristics , methods and outcomes . Overall , the impact of  resveratrol  on  BP  was reported in  17 trials .  Results : Administration of  resveratrol  did not significantly affect  neither systolic BP  [ weighted mean difference ( WMD ) : −2.5 95 % CI:(-5.5 , 0.6 ) mmHg ; p=0.116 ; I2=62.1 % ]  , nor diastolic BP  [ WMD : −0.5 95 % CI:(-2.2 , 1.3 ) mmHg ; p=0.613 ; I2=50.8  ]  ,  nor mean BP  [ MAP ; WMD : −1.3 95 % CI:(-2.8 , 0.1 ) mmHg ; p=0.070 ; I2=39.5 % ]  nor pulse pressure  [ PP ; WMD : −0.9 95 % CI:(-3.1 , 1.4 ) mmHg ; p=0.449 ; I2=19.2 % ] . However ,  significant  WMDs were detected in subsets of studies categorized according to high  resveratrol  daily dosage ( ≥300 mg/day ) and presence of diabetes . Meta-regression analysis revealed a positive association  between systolic BP-lowering  resveratrol  activity  ( slope : 1.99 ; 95 % CI : 0.05 , 3.93 ; two-tailed p=  0.04 ) and Body Mass Index ( BMI  ) at baseline , while no association was detected neither  between baseline BMI and MAP-lowering  resveratrol   activity ( slope : 1.35 ; 95 % CI : −0.22 , 2.91 ; two-tailed p= 0.09 ) nor  between baseline BMI and PP-lowering  resveratrol  activity  ( slope : 1.03 ; 95 % CI : −1.33 , 3.39 ; two-tailed   p= 0.39 ) . Resveratrol  was fairly well-tolerated and no serious adverse events  occurred among most of the eligible trials . Conclusion : The favourable effect  of resveratrol  emerging from the current meta- analysis suggests the possible use of this  nutraceutical  as active compound in order to  promote cardiovascular health  , mostly when used in high daily dose ( ≥300 mg/day ) and in diabetic patients."
"1QUESTIONS  In people with Parkinson 's disease  , does  home-based prescribed exercise  improve  balance-related activities and quality of life  compared with no intervention ? Are the effects of  home-based exercise  similar to those of equivalent  centre-based exercise  ? DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised and quasi-r and omised controlled trials . PARTICIPANTS  Adults diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease .  INTERVENTION  Predominantly home-based prescribed exercise  ( defined as a minimum of two-thirds of the exercise being completed at home ) . The intervention had to primarily involve  physical practice of exercises targeting gait and /or st and ing balance compared with either control ( ie  ,  usual care only , a sham intervention or no physiotherapy ) or equivalent predominantly centre-based exercise .  OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was  balance-related activities  and the secondary outcomes were  gait speed , Berg Balance Scale , Functional Reach test , and quality of life .  RESULTS  Sixteen trials  met the inclusion criteria and all contributed to the meta-analyses . Twelve trials compared  home-based prescribed exercise  with  control  , and four trials compared  home-based prescribed exercise  with  equivalent centre-based exercise .  Home-based  prescribed exercise  improved  balance-related activities  ( SMD 0.21 , 95 % CI 0.10 to 0.32 ) and  gait speed  ( SMD 0.30 , 95 % CI 0.12 to 0.49 ) , but not  quality of life  ( SMD 0.11 , 95 % CI -0.01 to 0.23 ) compared with control . Home-based and  centre-based  exercise had similar effects on  balance-related activities  ( SMD -0.04 , 95 % CI -0.36 to 0.27 ) and  quality of life  ( SMD -0.08 , 95 % CI -0.41 to 0.24 ) .   Home-based prescribed exercise  improves  balance-related activities  and  gait speed  in  people with Parkinson 's disease  , and these improvements are similar to improvements with equivalent centre-based exercise .

"nBACKGROUND Several lines of evidence have indicated the insulin-sensitizing , anti-diabetic and anti-atherosclerotic properties of adiponectin , as well as the inverse association between circulating levels of this adipokine and development of cardiovascular outcomes . Improvement of adiponectin status has been reported as a pleiotropic effect of  fibrate therapy  , but the findings have not been conclusive . OBJECTIVE To systematic ally review and meta-analyze available evidence from r and omized  placebo-controlled  trials ( RCTs ) on the impact of  fibrate therapy  on circulating levels of adiponectin . METHODS A comprehensive literature search in Medline was carried out to identify RCTs comparing the effect of  fibrate therapy vs. placebo  on circulating concentrations of adiponectin . A meta- analysis of eligible studies was performed using a r and om-effects model . Quality assessment  ,  sensitivity analysis  and  publication bias evaluations were conducted using st and ard methods . RESULTS  Twelve RCTs comprising 443 cases and 437 controls met  the selection criteria for systematic review , out of  which 9 RCTs ( 399 cases and 401 controls ) were included  in the meta- analysis . Quantitative data synthesis revealed a significant effect  for fibrate therapy  in  increasing circulating adiponectin levels  ( weighed mean difference : 0.38 μg/mL ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.13 - 0.63 μg/mL ; p = 0.003 ) . The  effect  size remained statistically significant when restricting the analysis to  fenofibrate  trials [ 0.31 ( 0.21 - 0.42 ) μg/mL ; p < 0.00001 ) . The observed effect was robust in sensitivity analyses and independent of fibrate dose . Imputation for potential missing studies led to the estimation of a greater effect size  for fibrate therapy  [ 0.53 ( 0.24 - 0.82 ) μg/mL ] .  The present meta- analysis suggests  that  fibrate  therapy  increases  circulating levels of adiponectin  . Whether increase in adiponectin levels contributes to reduction of  cardiovascular  effects  in subjects with dyslipidemia  treated  with  fibrates merits further investigation."

"sRecommendations for zinc intake during childhood vary widely across Europe . The EURRECA project attempts to consoli date the basis for the definition of micronutrient requirements , taking into account relationships among intake , status and health outcomes , in order to harmonise these recommendations . Data on  zinc intake  and  biomarkers of zinc status  reported in r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) can provide estimates of dose-response relationships which may be used for underpinning zinc reference values . This systematic review included  all RCTs of apparently healthy children aged 1–17 years published by February 2010  which  provided data on zinc intake and biomarkers of zinc status  . An  intake-status regression coefficient  ( ) was calculated for each individual study and calculated the overall pooled and SE ( ) using r and om effects meta- analysis on a double log scale . The pooled dose-response relationship  between zinc intake and zinc status  indicated that a doubling of the zinc intake increased the  serum/plasma zinc status  by 9 % . This evidence can be utilised , together with currently used balance studies and repletion/depletion studies , when setting zinc recommendations as a basis for nutrition policies."
"nOBJECTIVE To up date the evidence on the effectiveness of  lumbar supports , education and exercise  in the primary prevention of  low back pain at the workplace .  METHODS A computerized search for  controlled clinical trials published between 1997 and 2002  was conducted , and the method ological quality of the studies was assessed using a criteria list . The available evidence was grade d with a rating system for the level of evidence . Effect sizes of individual studies were combined if the studies were sufficiently similar . RESULTS Five new papers were identified for the up date . These trials were added to the previously available trials  ( n = 11 )  . The method ological quality of most studies was low . Since three of four RCTs on lumbar supports reported no effect , there is no evidence for the effectiveness of lumbar supports  .  No evidence for  education  could be found either , since all six RCTs showed negative results . The four RCTs on  exercise  consistently reported a positive effect , indicating limited evidence for the effectiveness of  exercise .   There is no evidence for the effectiveness of  lumbar supports or education  in the primary prevention of  low back pain  at the workplace . There is limited evidence for the efficacy of  exercise  , and the effect that can be obtained is moderate . There is still a need for method ologically sound studies and studies on the  cost-effectiveness  of  exercise .  Also the possible effect of lumbar supports in the treatment of back pain needs further investigation."

" Isocaloric exchange of fructose for other carbohydrate  improves long-term glycemic control  , as assessed  by glycated blood proteins  , without  affecting  insulin  in people with diabetes .  Generalizability may be limited because most of the trials were < 12 weeks and had relatively low MQS ( < 8 ) . To confirm these findings , larger and  longer fructose  feeding trials assessing both possible glycemic benefit and adverse metabolic effects are required."

"sThe paper refers to the recently published empirical data and systematic review s on the impact of  diets , foods , nutrients  and  bioactive substance  exposures in  pregnancy and in early infancy  , on the development of  atopic  disorders .   The results of studies referring to a broad range on dietary factors are mostly conflicting . There are several limitations of these research es . Based on the existing information , it is not possible to establish the role of  antioxidants and vitamin D supplementation  in atopic disease development . There is no evidence of major effects of prenatal use of folic acid on  asthma  or  allergies .  The association of some nutritional interventions with less  atopic sensitization  seems rather speculative even if such an effect has not been found for some other foods . The findings indicate rather a balanced and diverse diet without restrictions than a special dietary protocol . Farming-related exposures may protect against the development of  atopic disorders in children .  The hypothesis that the early introduction of  complementary  food , including the potentially allergenic foods , may reduce the risk of  food allergy and atopic dermatitis  is currently tested .  Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and probiotics  seem to be promising c and i date s for allergy prevention . But specific recommendations regarding  pre- and postnatal supplementation strategies , dose , treatment duration  etc . , are still undetermined . Longitudinal intervention studies in cohorts of  pregnant women  or  newborn  infants are needed to match the proper strategies in these issues."
"T Resistance training ( RT )  is thought to be effective in preventing muscle depletion , whereas  endurance training ( ET )  is known to improve exercise capacity and  health-related quality of life ( HRQoL )  in  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD )  . Our objectives were to assess the efficiency of combining  RT with ET  compared with  ET alone .  We identified eligible studies through a systematic multi- data base search . One author checked titles and abstract s for relevance using broad inclusion criteria , whilst two independent authors checked the full-text copies for eligibility . Two authors independently extracted data , and we assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation guidelines .  We included 11 r and omized controlled trials ( 331 participants ) and 2 previous systematic review s.  The meta-analyses showed equal improvements  in HRQoL , walking distance and exercise capacity .  However , we found moderate quality evidence of a  significant increase in leg muscle strength  favouring a  combination  of RT and ET   ( st and ardized mean difference of 0.69 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.39–0.98 ) . In conclusion , we found  significantly increased leg muscle strength  favouring a combination  of RT with ET  compared with  ET  alone . Therefore , we recommend that  RT  should be incorporated in rehabilitation of  COPD  together with ET."

"dGenetic risk prediction of chronic conditions including obesity , diabetes and CVD currently has limited predictive power but its potential to engage healthy behaviour change has been of immense research interest . We aim ed to underst and whether the latter is indeed true by conducting a systematic review and meta- analysis investigating whether  genetic risk communication  affects  motivation  and  actual behaviour change  towards preventative lifestyle modification . We included  all r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) since 2003  investigating the impact of  genetic risk communication  on  health behaviour  to  prevent cardiometabolic disease  ,  without restrictions on age , duration of  intervention  or language  . We conducted r and om-effects meta-analyses for perceived  motivation  for  behaviour change  and  clinical changes ( weight  loss ) and a narrative analysis for other outcomes . Within the  thirteen studies  review ed , five were vignette studies ( hypothetical RCT ) and seven were clinical RCT . There was no consistent effect of genetic risk on  actual motivation for weight loss , perceived motivation for dietary change  ( control v. genetic risk group st and ardised mean difference ( smd ) −0·15 ; 95 % CI −1·03 , 0·73 ,  P=0·74  )  or actual change in dietary behaviour  . Similar results were observed  for actual weight loss  ( control v. high genetic risk SMD 0·29 kg ; 95 % CI −0·74 , 1·31 , P=0·58 ) . This review found no clear or consistent evidence that genetic risk communication alone either raises motivation or translates  into actual change in dietary intake or physical activity  to reduce the risk of  cardiometabolic disorders in adults .  Of thirteen studies , eight were at high or unclear risk of bias . Additional larger-scale , high- quality clinical RCT are warranted."

"tThe comparison between  haemorrhoidal  treatments is still unclear . Attempts have been made to adopt a unifying postoperative scoring system and thus ensure adequate comparison between clinical trials . We aim ed to systematic ally review the available outcome scores of  haemorrhoidal treatment .  MEDLINE / Pubmed , Web of science , Embase and Cochrane were search ed from data base implementation until the December 6th 2019 . All studies describing or referencing a  score  to  assess  haemorrhoidal disease  treatment  were included .  Likert scale alone  ,  incontinence score alone  , general  assessment of quality of life  or scores developed for other proctologic disorders were excluded . The main outcome measures were validation of the scores and correlation of the score items to the core outcome set for haemorrhoidal disease developed by the European Society of Coloproctology .  From the 633 records initially screened , 22 studies were included : 8 original articles describing a  scoring system  and 14  referencing  a  previously  described  scoring system .   Only 1 score was vali date d by an external prospect i ve cohort . All the scores evaluated the  symptoms of haemorrhoidal disease .  No score integrated the  disease recurrences or patient ’s satisfaction . Scores values  tended to decrease postoperatively . The scores described by Gerjy et al. and by Shanmugan et al. are available question naires , which have been vali date d and used in various studies . These scores might help research ers for comparative studies between treatment modalities and optimize haemorrhoids treatment."

"eBackground and purpose : Among members of the health care team , nurses play a large role in actively engaging  stroke survivors  in  secondary stroke prevention programs  . This systematic review and meta- analysis examines the effectiveness of interventions in which nurses have a primary role on modification of risk factors among  stroke survivors  . Methods : We systematic ally search ed for  r and omized controlled trials in  relevant data bases investigating the  role of  nurses  in secondary  stroke  prevention .  Meta-analyses were conducted using Cochrane Review Manager Software . The mean pooled effect size , a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , and I-squared ( I2 ) for heterogeneity were calculated . Results :  Sixteen r and omized controlled trials were included with a total of 3568 stroke and transient ischemic attack patients .  After removing one outlier , the models demonstrated a statistically significant effect on  reducing systolic blood pressure  ( SMD = −0.14 ( 95 % CI = −0.23 , –0.05 ) , I2 = 0 % ; p = 0.002 , six studies , n =  1885 ) and diastolic blood pressure  ( SMD = −0.16 ( 95 % CI = −0.27 , –0.05 ) , I2 = 0 % ; p = 0.003 , four studies , n = 1316 ) . The interventions also significantly  improved physical activity  ( five studies , n=1234  ) , diet  ( three studies ,  n=425 ) , medication adherence  ( two studies , n=270  ) , and knowledge of risk factors  ( three studies , n=516 ) . However , there was no effect  on smoking cessation or reduction in use of alcohol  . Conclusion : We found that interventions in which nurses had a primary role were effective on  improving medical and behavioral risk factors  , as well  as knowledge of risk factors  as part of secondary prevention of stroke."
"dAnxiety disorders ( generalized anxiety disorder , panic disorder/agoraphobia , social anxiety disorder , and others ) are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders , and are associated with a high burden of illness . Anxiety disorders are often underrecognized and undertreated in primary care . Treatment is indicated when a patient shows marked distress or suffers from complications result ing from the disorder . The treatment recommendations given in this article are based on guidelines , meta-analyses , and systematic review s of r and omized controlled studies . Anxiety disorders should be treated with  psychological therapy , pharmacotherapy ,  or a  combination  of both .  Cognitive behavioral therapy  can be regarded as the psychotherapy with the highest level of evidence . First-line drugs are the  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors .  Benzodiazepines are not recommended for routine use . Other treatment options include  pregabalin , tricyclic antidepressants , buspirone , moclobemide  , and others . After remission , medications should be continued for 6 to 12 months . When developing a treatment plan ,  efficacy , adverse effects , interactions , costs , and the preference of the patient  should be considered."
">The aim of this systematic review and dose-response meta- analysis was to determine the effect of  Nigella Sativa ( N.S ) supplementation  on   liver and kidney parameters .   We search ed PubMed , Scopus , ISI Web of Science , Cochrane central register for controlled trials and Google Scholar from data base inception to April 2019 for relevant controlled trials . Mean differences and st and ard deviations for each outcome were pooled using a r and om-effects model and a dose-response analysis was performed using a fractional polynomial model .  Quality of evidence was evaluated  using  Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) methodology  .  Nineteen trials ( n = 1295 participants ) were included in the meta- analysis .  We observed that  N.S supplements  had significant reducing effects on  alkaline-phosphatase ( ALP )  [ 9 trials , n = 710 participants , weighted mean difference (WMD)= -10.825 ; 95%CI : -19.658 , -1.992 U/L ; P = 0.016 ; I2 = 75.7 % ; P-heterogeneity =  0.000 )  and  blood urea nitrogen ( BUN )  ( 12 trials , n = 821 participants , WMD= -1.016 ; 95 % CI : -1.760 , -0.273 U/L ; P = 0.007 ; I2 = 87.7 % ; P-heterogeneity = 0.000 ) concentrations . Subgroup analysis showed that , an intervention of more than 12 weeks was found to have a reducing effect  on aspartate- aminotransferase ( AST )  measures ( 2 trials , n = 201 participants , WMD= -11.317 ; 95%CI : -15.007 , -7.626 ; P = 0.000 ; I2 = 0.0 % ; P-heterogeneity =  0.977 ) . Creatinine levels  increased significantly in studies that considered adjusted analysis based on covariates ( 3 trials , n = 152 participants , WMD = 0.070 ; 95 % CI : 0.027 , 0.112 U/L ; P = 0.001 ; I2 = 0.0 % ; P-heterogeneity = 0.788 ) . A daily dose  of 1100 - 1500 mg of N.S supplements  was observed to have a substantial reducing effect  on ALP levels  ( 5 trials , n = 340 participants , WMD= -11.323 ; 95 % CI : -21.418 , -1.229 U/L ; P = 0.028 ; I2 = 0.00 % ; P-heterogeneity = 0.686 ) , while a dosage of more than 2000 mg per day led to a significant increase  in BUN concentrations  ( 2 trials , n = 101 participants , WMD= -1.016 ; 95 % CI : -1.760 , -0.273 U/L ; P = 0.007 ; I2 = 87.7 % ; P-heterogeneity = 0.000 ) . Our data suggested  that N.S supplementation  had significant impacts on  liver and kidney parameters  leading to a  decrease in ALP and BUN levels  . Longer duration of intervention and normal daily dosages  of N.S supplements  led to significant  reductions in ALP and AST concentrations  , respectively , while higher daily dosages  increased BUN levels  . Hence , in spite of favorable impacts of  N.S supplements  on liver and kidney parameters , due to the herbal nature of  N.S  , more studies with high- quality , large-scale , long-term intervention and precise baseline characteristics are needed to assess the exact effective dose , duration and efficacy  of N.S supplementation  on  kidney  and  liver parameters ."
"1OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review was to perform a meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) examining the efficacy of  fibrate therapy  in reducing  plasma concentration or activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ( PAI-1 )  . METHODS Scopus and MEDLINE data bases were search ed ( up to October 15 , 2014  )  to identify RCTs investigating whether  fibrates  lower  plasma PAI-1 concentration  or  activity  . A r and om-effects model and the generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis . Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the one- study remove approach . R and om-effects meta-regression was performed to assess the impact of potential moderators on the estimated effect sizes . RESULTS A  total of 14 RCTs examining the effects of  gemfibrozil  ( 6 trials )  , bezafibrate  ( 4 trials ) , and  fenofibrate  ( 5 trials ) were included .  Meta- analysis suggested that fibrate therapy did not significantly reduce  plasma PAI-1 concentration  ( weighed mean difference [ WMD ] : -11.39 ng/mL , 95 % CI : -26.64 , 3.85 , p=0.143 ) or  activity  ( WMD : 2.02 U/mL , 95 % CI : -0.87 , 4.90 , p=0.170 ) . These results remained unchanged after subgroup analysis according to duration of treatment ( < 12 and ≥12 weeks ) and type of fibrate administered  ( fenofibrate , bezafibrate or gemfibrozil )  . The estimated effects of fibrate therapy  on plasma concentration and activity of PAI-1  were independent of treatment duration and  changes in plasma triglyceride levels  in the meta-regression analysis .  This meta- analysis of RCTs suggested that fibrate therapy does not  reduce plasma concentration or activity of PAI-I.  The putative benefits  of  fibrate therapy in  patients with cardiovascular disease  appear to be exerted via mechanisms independent of effects on PAI-1."
"sAIMS  Overactive bladder ( OAB )  affects over 17 % of the population and significantly effect the  health-related quality of life .  The treatments for OAB include first line  ( lifestyle modification , pelvic floor muscle training )  , second line  ( anticholinergic or beta-3 agonist medications )  , and  third line therapies ( intradetrusor botulinum toxin injection , sacral neurostimulation [ SNM ] , or percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation [ PTNS ] ) .  For  those with urinary incontinence secondary to OAB  , complete continence is the goal of therapy , though cure rates are only 5 % to 40 % . The use of combination therapies can be employed in refractory OAB , however , the efficacy of pooled modalities is relatively unknown . Our objective was to determine the volume of data supporting combination therapy in treating OAB . METHODS We systematic ally review ed PubMed  ,  EMBASE  , the  Cochrane Library ,  and  Google Scholar  for articles published before October 2018 .  Each was independently review ed by two review ers and examined in detail if they met inclusion criteria . RESULTS  A total of 32 studies met inclusion criteria  and were review ed . Most large prospect i ve studies evaluated combinations of medications with behavioral therapy or medications together . Combination therapy studies of third-line treatments were rare and centered on medication with PTNS . No studies examined  intradetrusor botulinum toxin injections in combination with another therapy  and only one retrospective study briefly examined   SNM  therapy  in combination with medication .  Combination therapy , with certain first , second , and third-line OAB therapies , appears to be  efficacious .  There is a further need for carefully design ed combination therapy studies , particularly those including third line modalities."
"Aformation of large informatic data bases , or clinical quality registries , linking preoperative and intraoperative clinical data , imaging , genomics , and cancer and drug prescription data bases . From a clinical perspective , we forsee  patients undergoing the  same  operation  receiving a different anaesthetic depending on their outcome risk . Taking  knee arthroplasty  as an example ,  patients deemed at low risk of experiencing outcomes such as  postoperative pain or chronic pain   may receive  intra-articular local anaesthesia infiltration ;   patients at medium risk  may obtain  additional analgesia via a saphe-nous nerve catheter ;  and  patients at high risk  may also  receive nerve blocks and  anti-hyperalgesics  .  Best possible treatment in low- and high-risk groups , based on the clinical balance of efficacy and side-effects , would be determined by stratified RCTs . We believe that , by adopting this philosophy , a stratified , holistic approach to research will bring a more personalized approach to anaesthesia .

In 1946 , Mendelson 1 showed that  pulmonary complications  and  death  could arise in pregnant  women  because of aspiration of gastric contents . Since then , prevention of aspiration of gastric contents has contributed significantly to a decrease in  maternal deaths .  Aspiration of gastric contents also impacts other areas of anaesthetic practice , particularly emergency surgery . Warner and colleagues 2 demonstrated in a large series from the Mayo Clinic that no  aspiration  occurred in  pregnant or post-partum women  ( probably because of the routine use of prophylactic measures ) , while both its occurrence and severity were significant in emergency procedures . An important risk factor for aspiration is  gastric volume  , determined in large part by  gastric emptying .

"sOBJECTIVE To develop an evidence -based guideline to help  clinicians  make decisions about when and how to safely taper and stop  benzodiazepine receptor agonists ( BZRAs ) ;  to focus on the highest level of evidence available and seek input from primary care professionals in the guideline development , review , and endorsement processes . METHODS The overall team comprised  8 clinicians ( 1 family physician , 2 psychiatrists , 1 clinical psychologist , 1 clinical pharmacologist , 2 clinical pharmacists , and 1 geriatrician ) and a method ologist ; members disclosed conflicts of interest .  For guideline development , a systematic process was used , including the GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) approach . Evidence was generated by conducting a systematic review of BZRA deprescribing trials for insomnia , as well as performing a review of review s of the harms of continued BZRA use and narrative syntheses of patient preferences and re source implication s. This evidence and GRADE quality of evidence ratings were used to generate recommendations . The team refined guideline content and recommendations through consensus and synthesized clinical considerations to address front-line clinician questions . The draft guideline was review ed by clinicians and stakeholders . RECOMMENDATIONS We recommend that deprescribing ( tapering slowly ) of BZRAs be offered to  elderly adults ( ≥ 65 years ) who take BZRAs  , regardless of  duration  of  use  , and suggest that deprescribing ( tapering slowly ) be offered to  adults aged 18 to 64  who  have used BZRAs  for more than 4 weeks . These recommendations apply to  patients who use BZRAs to treat insomnia on its own ( primary insomnia ) or comorbid insomnia  where potential underlying comorbidities are effectively managed . This guideline does not apply to  those  with other  sleep disorders  or  untreated  anxiety , depression , or other physical or mental health conditions that might be causing or aggravating insomnia .  Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are associated with harms , and therapeutic effects might be short term . Tapering BZRAs  improves cessation rates  compared with usual care without serious harms . Patients might be more amenable to deprescribing conversations if they underst and the rationale ( potential for harm ) , are involved in developing the tapering plan , and are offered behavioural advice . This guideline provides recommendations for making decisions about when and how to reduce and stop BZRAs . Recommendations are meant to assist with , not dictate , decision making in conjunction with patients."
"nObjectives : To systematic ally review and meta-analyse existing evidence on the association between  folate/B12  , and  depression among the aged people .  Methods : Following PRISMA /STROBE guidelines , the Medline abstract s were retrieved using an algorithm comprising relevant MeSH terms . Publications on the association of  folate/B12 serum measurements  with  depression  were abstract ed independently by two review ers and included in both gender and gender-specific meta-analyses , following recarculations of published data as appropriate . The  Newcastle-Ottawa scale  was used to evaluate the quality of included studies . Results : Both  gender  data were contributed  by 11  folate-related  ( 7949 individuals ) and 9  B12-related  studies ( 6308 individuals ) , whereas gender-specific data by 4  folate-related  ( 3409 individuals ) and 3  B12-related  studies ( 1934 individuals ) .  A statistically significant overall association between both exposures of interest  ( low folate and B12 levels ) and depression  was observed ( ORfolate:1.23 , 95%CI:1.07–1.43 , ORB12:1.20 , 95%CI:1.02–1.42 ) . Gender-specific estimates pointed to a statistically significant positive association  between low B12 levels and depression  only among women ( OR:1.33 , 95%CI:1.02–1.74 ) ; the gender specific associations of  low folate levels with depression  were , however , non-significant and of counter-direction ( ORfemales:1.37 , 95%CI:0.90–2.07 ; ORmales:0.84 , 95%CI:0.57–1.25 ) . Conclusion : Low folate and B12 serum levels seem to be associated with   depression  in the aged  . The gender-specific analyses are confined to a positive association of  low B12 with  depression  among older women  and call for further research in this direction."
"DPurpose of Review Purpose of Review Management of  treatment-resistant ( TR ) panic disorder ( PD )  is an unresolved issue . In this paper , we provide a brief summary of previous findings , an up date d ( 2015–2017 ) systematic review of pharmacological/non-pharmacological studies , and our personal perspective on this topic . Recent Findings Recent Findings We found a very limited number of recent findings .  Quetiapine  extended-release augmentation has not been found to be beneficial , in comparison to  placebo  , in non-responders to previously recommended pharmacotherapy . In non-responders to  cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT )  , switching to  paroxetine/citalopram  has been found to be more effective than  continuing CBT .   Acceptance and  commitment therapy  ( ACT )  has shown some improvement in patients ’ resistance to previous psychological/pharmacological interventions compared with a waiting-list condition . Summary Summary Previous and recent findings regarding the treatment of TR  PD  suffer from several method ological limitations . Available studies provide insufficient evidence to support the use of medications alternative to the recommended medications ; the efficacy of ACT needs confirmation with more rigorous methodology .  Prolonged pharmacotherapy  may produce significant improvement in patients with unsatisfactory  response to  short-term pharmacotherapy   , while switching to  pharmacotherapy  may help non-responders to  CBT .  We discuss our personal perspective on the definition of “  treatment  resistance ” as it relates to PD and provide personalized intervention strategies to increase  favorable clinical outcomes  based on our clinical expertise and review of experimental studies on the pathophysiology of PD."

" There are no clinical ly meaningful  BP lowering differences  between different  ACE inhibitors .  The  BP lowering effect  of  ACE inhibitors  is modest ; the magnitude of  trough BP  lowering at one-half the manufacturers ' maximum recommended dose and above is -8/-5 mm Hg . Furthermore , 60 to 70 % of this  trough BP lowering effect  occurs with recommended starting doses . The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with  ACE inhibitors  because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of  adverse effects  in many of the trials."
" :  Women with intolerable menopausal symptoms  may wish to weigh the benefits of symptom relief against the small absolute risk of harm arising from short-term use of low-dose  HT  , provided they do not have specific contraindications .  HT  may be unsuitable for some women , including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease , increased risk of thromboembolic disease ( such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis ) or increased risk of some types of cancer ( such as breast cancer , in women with a uterus ) . The risk of endometrial cancer among  women with a uterus  taking oestrogen-only  HT  is well documented .  HT  is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of  cardiovascular disease or dementia  , nor for prevention of  deterioration of cognitive function  in  postmenopausal women .  Although  HT  is considered effective for the prevention of  postmenopausal osteoporosis  , it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk for whom  non-oestrogen therapies  are unsuitable . Data are insufficient for assessment of the risk of long-term  HT  use in perimenopausal women and in postmenopausal women younger than 50 years of age."
"nBACKGROUND Previous studies have yielded conflicting results and substantial uncertainty about any independent association of Helicobacter pylori infection with  dyspepsia  , and about any benefits of  antibiotic treatments  for  nonulcer or uninvestigated dyspepsia .  OBJECTIVES To perform a systematic review of the literature to determine whether chronic infection with H pylori is relevant to  nonulcer or uninvestigated dyspepsia .  METHODS Observational studies of associations between H pylori  and dyspepsia  published before April 1999 and r and omized trials of the effects of  H  pylori  eradication  on  dyspepsia  published before January 2000 were identified by computer-assisted literature search es of relevant journals , reference lists , and discussion s with authors . Relevant data were abstract ed from the published reports by 2 investigators according to a fixed protocol . RESULTS  Thirty relevant observational studies  were identified  involving approximately 3392 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia , and 11 separate observational studies were identified , involving 6426 patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia .  Reports of strong associations in small observational studies without appropriate adjustment for potential confounding factors were not generally confirmed by larger and better- design ed studies . No studies have been reported , however , that can reliably confirm or exclude the existence of any weak associations . Twenty-two r and omized trials of treatments against H pylori were found involving a  total of 2340 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia , almost all with positive H pylori test results .  Only a few of these trials involved  effective  antibacterial regimens   with prolonged follow-up , and even these studies were too small to assess the possibility of moderate benefits .  The available evidence indicates that there is no strong association between H pylori and dyspepsia , but there is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the existence of a modest association."
"rOBJECTIVE To compile and critique research on the diagnostic accuracy of individual   orthopaedic physical examination  tests  in a manner that would allow clinicians to judge whether these tests are valuable to their practice . METHODS A computer-assisted literature search of  MEDLINE , CINAHL , and SPORTD iscus data bases ( 1966 to October 2006 )  using keywords related to diagnostic  accuracy  of   physical examination tests  of the shoulder .  The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS ) tool was used to critique the quality of each paper . Meta- analysis through meta-regression of the  diagnostic odds ratio ( DOR )  was performed on the  Neer test for impingement , the Hawkins-Kennedy test for impingement , and the Speed test for superior  labral pathology  .  RESULTS  Forty-five studies were critiqued  with only half demonstrating acceptable high quality and only two having adequate sample size . For impingement , the meta- analysis revealed that the  pooled sensitivity and specificity  for the   Neer test   was 79 % and 53 % , respectively , and for the Hawkins-Kennedy test was 79 % and 59 % , respectively . For superior labral ( SLAP ) tears , the  summary sensitivity and specificity  of the  Speed test  was 32 % and 61 % , respectively . Regarding orthopaedic special tests ( OSTs ) where meta- analysis was not possible either due to lack of sufficient studies or heterogeneity between studies , the list that demonstrates both high  sensitivity  and high specificity is short :  hornblowers 's sign  and the  external rotation lag sign  for tears of the rotator cuff ,  biceps load II  for superior labral anterior to posterior ( SLAP ) lesions , and  apprehension , relocation and anterior release  for anterior instability . Even these tests have been under-studied or are from lower quality studies or both . No tests for impingement or acromioclavicular ( AC ) joint pathology demonstrated significant diagnostic  accuracy  .  Based on pooled data , the diagnostic accuracy of the  Neer test for impingement  , the  Hawkins-Kennedy test for impingement  and the  Speed test  for labral pathology is limited . There is a great need for large , prospect i ve , well- design ed studies that examine the diagnostic accuracy of the numerous physical examination tests of the shoulder . Currently , almost without exception , there is a lack of clarity with regard to whether common OSTs used in clinical examination are useful in differentially diagnosing pathologies of the shoulder."
"SBackground Obesity is a growing global health concern that may lead to cardiovascular disease , type II diabetes , and cancer . Several systematic review s have shown that technology is successful in combating obesity through increased physical activity , but there is no known review on interventions that use an  electronic activity monitor system ( EAMS ) . EAMSs  are defined as a wearable device that objective ly measures lifestyle physical activity and can provide feedback , beyond the display of basic activity count information , via the monitor display or through a partnering application to elicit continual self-monitoring of activity behavior . These devices improve upon  st and ard pedometers  because they have the ability to provide visual feedback on activity progression , verbal encouragement , and social comparison . This systematic review aim ed to synthesize the efficacy and feasibility results of EAMSs within published physical activity interventions . Methods Electronic data bases and journal references were search ed for relevant articles . Data sources included CINAHL , Cochrane CENTRAL , Medline Ovid , PsycINFO , and clinical trials.gov . Out of  the 1,574 retrieved , 11 articles met the inclusion criteria .  These articles were review ed for quality and content based on a risk of bias tool and intervention components . Results Most articles were determined to be of medium quality while two were of low quality , and one of high quality . Significant  pre-post improvements  in the  EAMS  group were found in five of nine studies for  physical activity  and in four of five studies for  weight .  One found a significant increase in  physical activity  and two studies found significant  weight loss  in the intervention group compared with the comparator group . The  EAMS  interventions appear to be feasible with most studies reporting continual  wear of the device  during waking hours and a higher  retention rate  of participants in the  EAMS  groups . Conclusion These studies provide preliminary evidence suggesting that  EAMS  can  increase physical activity and decrease weight significantly  , but their efficacy compared to other interventions has not yet been demonstrated . More high- quality r and omized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the overall effect of  EAMS  , examine which  EAMS  features are most effective , and determine which population s are most receptive to an EAMS."
"SHydrotherapy is often used in the treatment of   fibromyalgia  syndrome ( FMS )  , however there has been limited evaluation of its effectiveness . The aim of this systematic review was therefore to examine the effectiveness of  hydrotherapy  in the management of FMS . AMED , BNI , CINAHL , The Cochrane Library , EMBASE , MEDLINE , ProQuest , PubMed , Science Direct and Web of Science were search ed ( 1990–July 2006 ) . Key words used ‘  fibromyalgia ’  and  ‘  hydrotherapy  ’  ,  ‘ balneotherapy ’ , ‘ aqua therapy ’ , ‘ pool therapy ’ , ‘ water therapy ’ , ‘ swimming ’ , ‘ hydrogalvanic ’ , ‘ spa therapy ’ , ‘ physiotherapy ’ , ‘ physical therapy ’ and ‘ rehabilitation ’ .  Search es were supplemented with h and search es of selected journals . R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) were assessed for method ological quality using the  van Tulder scale  . Ten RCTs met the inclusion criteria .  Mean method  ological  quality  was 4.5/9 on the van Tulder scale . Positive outcomes were reported for  pain , health-status and tender point count .  There is strong evidence for the use of  hydrotherapy  in the management of FMS."
"sAtrial fibrillation is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia . Its prevalence increases with age and preferentially affects  male patients . Over 75 years of age  , however , female patients being more prevalent , the absolute number of patients affected is similar between sexes . Despite this , few data are available in the literature concerning sex-related differences in  atrial fibrillation patients .  The present systematic review therefore considers  comorbidities , referring symptoms , quality of life ,  pharmacological approaches   and   trans-catheter ablation   in  female rather than in male atrial fibrillation patients  in search of parameters that may have an impact on the treatment outcome . In brief ,  female atrial fibrillation patients  more commonly present comorbidities , leading to a higher prevalence of persistent atrial fibrillation ; moreover , they refer to hospital care later and with a longer disease history . Atrial fibrillation symptoms relate to low  quality of life  in female patients  ;  in fact , atrial fibrillation paroxysm usually presents higher  heart rate  , leading to preferentially adopt a rate rather than a rhythm-control strategy .  Female atrial fibrillation patients  present an increased  risk of stroke  , worsened by the lower   oral anticoagulant  prescription  rate related to the concomitant higher  haemorrhagic risk profile .   Trans-catheter ablation  is under-used in female  patients  and , on the contrary , they are more commonly affected by anti-arrhythmic drug side effects."
"tOBJECTIVES  Resin composite sealants  are retained longer than  low-viscosity glass-ionomer sealants .  Nevertheless , a systematic review showed that there is no evidence that  resin composite sealants  are superior to  low-viscosity glass-ionomers  in preventing dentine carious lesion development . This case study aim ed to investigate reasons for this . METHODS  4 teeth were  sealed with 2 br and s of high-viscosity glass-ionomer  according  to the  ART technique in 2 children aged 10 and 11.5 years , having a low caries-risk status , and followed clinical ly for between 8 and 13 years .  At the final year , impressions were taken for SEM images that were assessed by two evaluators . RESULTS Pits and fissures that were clinical ly diagnosed as free of sealant material appeared to contain  remnants of high-viscosity glass-ionomer sealant material  in the deeper parts of pits and fissures , on SEM images of 3 teeth .  This study confirms the likelihood that remnants of  high-viscosity glass-ionomer sealant material  are retained and block the deeper parts of pits and fissures even after the sealant appears to have disappeared clinical ly , exercising their carious lesion preventive effect."
" Although  total reoperation rates  did not differ in the two population s ,  reoperation  for  bearing dislocation  was more likely to occur in Asian than in Western patients , whereas reoperation for  lateral knee OA  progression was more likely to occur in Western than in Asian patients after Oxford Phase III UKA . Although possible explanations for these findings may be hypothesized , additional r and omized , prospect i ve comparative studies are needed . However , better survival outcomes after UKA may require consideration of ethnicity and lifestyle choices in addition to traditional surgical technique and perioperative care .

" : The  probability for success  for EMS proved to be significantly greater than the probability for success for RES , providing best available evidence on the influence of cavity preparation with  ultrasonic tips and /or SuperEBA  ( Keystone Industries , Gibbstown , NJ ) , IRM ( Dentsply Sirona , York , PA ) , MTA , or  silicate  cements as root‐end filling material instead of a shallow cavity preparation and placement of a resin‐based material . Additional large‐scale r and omized clinical trials are needed to assess other predictors of outcome . HIGHLIGHTSEndodontic microsurgery ( EMS ) with the use of  high‐magnification ultrasonic root‐end preparation and root‐end filling with SuperEBA , IRM ,  MTA , or other  calcium silicate cements  has a high probability  of success  .  Resin‐based endodontic surgery  with the use of high‐magnification preparation of a shallow concave root‐end cavity with bonded resin‐based root‐end filling material performed less favorably than EMS."

"RBackground  Overtraining  syndrome ( OTS ) , functional ( FOR ) and non-functional overreaching ( NFOR ) are conditions diagnosed in  athletes with decreased performance and fatigue  , triggered by metabolic , immune , hormonal and other dysfunctions and result ed from an imbalance between training stress and proper recovery . Despite previous descriptions , there is a lack of a review that discloses all hormonal findings in OTS/FOR/NFOR . The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate whether and which roles hormones play in OTS/FOR/NFOR . Methods A systematic search up to June  15th  , 2017 was performed in the PUBMED , MEDLINE and Cochrane data bases following PRISMA protocol , with the expressions : (1)overtraining  ,  (2)overreaching , (3)overtrained  ,  (4)overreached , or (5)underperformance , and ( plus )  (a)hormone , (b)hormonal , (c)endocrine , (d)adrenal , (e)cortisol , (f)GH , (g)ACTH , (h)testosterone , (i)IGF-1 , (j)TSH , (k)T4 , (l)T3 , (m)LH , (n)FSH , (o)prolactin , ( p ) IGFBP-3  and related articles . Results  A total of 38 studies were selected .   Basal levels of hormones  were mostly normal in  athletes with OTS/FOR/NFOR  compared with healthy  athletes .  Distinctly , stimulation tests , mainly performed in maximal exercise conditions , showed blunted  GH and ACTH responses  in OTS/FOR/NFOR athletes , whereas cortisol and plasma catecholamines showed conflicting findings and the other hormones responded normally . Conclusion  Basal hormone levels  are not good predictor but blunted ACTH  and GH  responses to stimulation tests may be good predictors of OTS/FOR/NFOR."

"nABSTRACT  Virtual environments ( VEs )  have demonstrated promise as a neuropsychological assessment modality and may be well suited for the evaluation of  children suspected of having an autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .  Some recent studies indicate their potential for enhancing  reliability , ecologically validity , and sensitivity  over traditional neuropsychological evaluation measures . Although research using  VEs  with ASD is increasing to the degree that several review s of the literature have been conducted , the review s to date lack rigor and are not necessarily specific to cognitive or neuropsychological assessment as many focus on intervention . The aim of this project was to comprehensively examine the current literature status of  neuropsychological assessment  in pediatric ASD using  VEs  by conducting a systematic review . Specifically , psychometric comparisons of  VEs  to traditional neuropsychological assessment measures that examined reliability , validity , and /or diagnostic accuracy for  pediatric individuals , age 18 and below , with ASD  were sought . The search using key words yielded  899 manuscripts , 894 of which were discarded for not meeting inclusion criteria .  The remaining five met exclusion criteria . Therefore , the systematic review was modified to a brief report . These findings ( or lack thereof ) indicate a significant gap in the literature in that  psychometric comparisons  of these  tools  for the  neuropsychological assessment  of  pediatric individuals with ASD  are lacking . An important future direction of research will be extending the demonstrated  incremental validity  of VE  neuropsychological assessment  with other neurodevelopmental ( e.g. , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ) and adult population s to pediatric ASD population."
"sThe clinical efficacy and safety of  bariatric surgery  trials were systematic ally review ed . MEDLINE , EMBASE , CENTRAL were search ed to February 2009 . A basic PubCrawler alert was run until March 2010 . Trial registries , HTA websites and systematic review s were search ed . Manufacturers were contacted . R and omized trials comparing  bariatric surgeries and /or st and ard care  were selected .  Evidence -based items  potentially indicating risk of bias were assessed .  Network meta- analysis  was performed using Bayesian techniques .  Of 1838 citations , 31 RCTs involving 2619 patients ( mean age 30 - 48 y ; mean BMI levels 42 - 58 kg/m(2 ) ) met eligibility criteria .  As compared with st and ard  care  , differences in  BMI levels  from baseline at year 1  ( 15 trials ; 1103 participants )  were as follows :  jejunoileal bypass  [ MD : -11.4 kg/m(2 ) ] ,  mini-gastric bypass  [ -11.3 kg/m(2 ) ] ,  biliopancreatic diversion  [ -11.2 kg/m(2 ) ] ,  sleeve gastrectomy  [ -10.1 kg/m(2 ) ] ,  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  [ -9.0 kg/m(2 ) ] ,  horizontal gastroplasty  [ -5.0 kg/m(2 ) ] ,  vertical b and ed gastroplasty  [ -6.4 kg/m(2 ) ] , and  adjustable gastric b and ing  [ -2.4 kg/m(2 ) ] .  Bariatric surgery  appears efficacious compared to  st  and  ard care  in reducing  BMI . Weight losses  are greatest with diversionary procedures , intermediate with diversionary/restrictive procedures , and lowest with those that are purely restrictive . Compared with  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  ,  adjustable gastric b and ing  has lower  weight loss efficacy  , but also leads to fewer serious adverse effects."
" : This systematic review and meta- analysis indicate that  PDE5 inhibitors  are  effective  and  well  tolerated to treat  ED secondary to SCI  compared with placebo , as measured by response to GEQ , SEP2 , SEP3 and incidence of adverse events .

"pThe aim of this systematic review was to find evidence -based support in the literature to allow immediate unrestricted weight bearing after   primary uncemented total hip arthroplasty  (  THA  ) .   Accelerated rehabilitation programs for THA  are becoming increasingly popular to shorten hospital stay and to facilitate rapid restoration of function . The goals of these rehabilitation programs could be more easily achieved if immediate  unrestricted weight bearing  ( UWB ) could be allowed after a  THA .  So far , however , immediate weight bearing is frequently contraindicated in widely accepted protocol s for uncemented  THA  due to fear for subsidence and absence of osseous integration of the femoral stem . Thus , frequently protected weight bearing and restricted activities are still advocated for at least 6 weeks after surgery . In addition , we analyzed the literature to come to a recommendation on gait pattern and  walking  aid . From a systematic search in several electronic data bases  13 studies met the inclusion criteria  . These studies were review ed according to the Cochrane methodology . We found moderate to strong evidence that  no adverse effects on subsidence and osseous integration of the femoral stem  after uncemented THA occur after immediate UWB . Based on this literature review , we recommend early rehabilitation after   uncemented THA   with a reciprocally gait pattern using crutches , one cane for  independency in ADL  in case patients walk limp-free and walking without crutches as soon as possible . During the first weeks after surgery only stair climbing should be performed with protected weight bearing because of high torsion loads on the hip."
" and Relevance Although  screening with ECG  can detect previously unknown cases of atrial fibrillation , it has not been shown to detect more cases than  screening  focused on pulse palpation . Treatments for atrial fibrillation reduce the  risk of stroke and all-cause mortality and  increase  the risk of bleeding  , but trials have not assessed whether treatment of screen-detected  asymptomatic older adults  results in better  health outcomes  than treatment after detection by usual care or after symptoms develop."
"sThere is an ongoing debate about the possible influences of  nonnutritive sweeteners ( NNS )  on  body weight .  We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) with NNS to assess their impact on  body weight .  We systematic ally search ed for RCTs at least 4 weeks in duration , evaluating the effect of  NNS  on  body weight  , both in  subjects with healthy weight and in subjects with overweight/obesity at any age  , and compared the effects of  NNS vs caloric and noncaloric comparators .  The primary outcome was the  difference in body weight  between NNS and comparators .  Twenty studies were eligible ( n = 2914 ) . Participants  consuming  NNS  showed  significant weight/ BMI differences  favouring NNS compared with nonusers . Grouping by nature of comparator revealed that  NNS  vs placebo/no intervention and  NNS  vs  water  produced no effect . When comparing  NNS vs sucrose  ,  significant weight/ BMI differences  appeared favouring  NNS .  Consumption of  NNS  led to  significantly negative weight/ BMI differences  in unrestricted energy diets , but not in weight-reduction diets .  Participants with overweight/obesity and adults  showed  significant favourable weight/ BMI differences  with  NNS .  Data suggest that replacing  sugar  with  NNS  leads to  weight reduction  , particularly in  participants with overweight/obesity  under an unrestricted diet , information that could be utilized for evidence -based public policy decisions."

"sThe aim of this study was to systematic ally review the available studies measuring the bond strength of   orthodontic bracket-adhesive system   under different experimental conditions in vivo . Literature search was performed in four different data bases : PubMed , Web of Science , Cochrane , and Scopus using the keywords – bond strength , orthodontic brackets ,  bracket-adhesive  , and in vivo . A total of  six full-text articles were selected based  on the  inclusion and exclusion criteria  of our study after a careful assessment by the two independent review ers . Data selection was performed by following PRISMA 2009 guidelines . Five of the selected studies were clinical trials ; one study was a  r and omized clinical trial  . From each of the selected articles , the following data were extracted – number of sample s , with the type of  tooth  involved material s under experiment methods of measurement , the  time interval between bonding and debonding orthodontic brackets  ,  mode of force application  , and the  bond strength results  with the overall outcome . The method ological quality assessment of each article was done by the modified Downs and Black checklist method . The qualitative analyses were done by two independent review ers . Conflicting issues were resolved in a consensus meeting by consulting the third review er ( MKA ) . Meta- analysis could not be performed due to the lack of homogenous study results . The review reached no real conclusion apart from the lack of efforts to clinical ly evaluate the  bonding efficiency  of a wide range of orthodontic bracket-adhesive systems in terms of debonding force compared to laboratory-based in vitro and ex vivo studies."
"sCONTEXT GH deficiency ( GHD  )  of the  adult  is a clinical condition characterized by the presence of several traditional and emerging cardiovascular risk factors that can significantly increase  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .  It is still an open issue whether  GH replacement  is able not only to improve  cardiovascular risk factors  but also to decrease  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The major source of data acquisition included PubMed research strategies . Original articles , systematic review s and meta-analyses , and included relevant citations were screened . EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS In untreated GHD ,  cardiovascular risk  is increased due to abnormal  lipid profile  ( increased total and low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol  , increased  triglycerides  , and reduced  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ) and impaired  glucose metabolism  . Emerging  cardiovascular risk factors/markers  such  as proinflammatory cytokines , C-reactive protein , and adipokines  are also increased in GHD patients . Increased  cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  have also been reported in GHD . GH treatment has been shown to improve both  traditional and emerging cardiovascular risk factors and markers .  However , evidence on the effects of  GH replacement  on  cardiovascular events and mortality  is limited .  The GHD population may be considered at high cardiovascular risk , and  GH substitution  may be expected to bring an added value to  patients with hypopituitarism  in terms of cardiovascular protection . However , there is too limited evidence ( rarely coming from r and omized and controlled studies ) to recommend GH treatment based on the cardiovascular status of the patients."
"yOBJECTIVE Several antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) have been associated with a detrimental effect on bone health through a reduction in serum vitamin D. Subsequently , several studies have investigated the effect of  vitamin D  supplementation in  persons with epilepsy being treated with AEDs .  The present systematic review of published literature was conducted to determine the effect of  vitamin D intervention  on bone health in  adults with epilepsy .  METHODS The following data bases were search ed using keywords including but not limited to epilepsy , bone , and vitamin D : PubMed , Medline , Embase , Scopus , Cochrane Clinical Trials , International Pharmaceutical Abstract s , Health Canada Clinical Trials Data base , Clinical Trials.gov , EU Clinical Trials , and Google .  Studies were eligible if there was an epilepsy diagnosis , participants were adults ( 18 + years old ) , and  vitamin D  treatment and bone outcome were provided .  Articles were screened independently by 2 review ers . Method ological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool and a modified  Newcastle Ottawa Scale  for nonr and omized studies . RESULTS  Nine studies were found to  be  eligible  for this review . After  vitamin D  treatment , there appeared to be positive changes in  bone turnover markers ;  3 of 8 studies found the increase in  serum calcium  to be significant , 6 of 8 studies found the decrease in  alkaline phosphatase  to be significant , and 2 of 4 studies found the decrease in  parathyroid hormone  to be significant . All 6 studies that investigated  bone mineralization  had significant findings ; however , due to varying method ologies , the impact of vitamin  D  on  bone mineralization  was inconclusive . SIGNIFICANCE  Vitamin D  does appear to have some benefit to bone health in  adults  with epilepsy , and therefore supplementation could potentially be a requisite to using some AEDs . To clarify the role of  vitamin D supplementation  to manage the adverse effect of AEDs on bone health in  adults  with epilepsy , long-term trials that use higher doses ( > 1800 IU ) and measure  bone mineral density  are necessary."
"FBACKGROUND  Physical activity ( PA )  practice has been inversely associated to  body   fat  ( BF ) and recommended as a way to reduce and prevent obesity . The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association of   PA  and BF in adolescence .  METHODS The review includes  18 longitudinal studies found in the PubMed data base  ,  comprising papers published from January 1990 to July 2014 .  Studies assessing BF only through body mass index were excluded . RESULTS Among the outcomes analyzed , waist circumference , skinfolds , and absolute and relative fat mass measurement were identified . Question naires were the more predominant way to evaluate  PA .  Most studies showed that  PA  promotes a  protective effect against a higher BF gain .   It was concluded that  PA  has a  protective effect against BF  with differences between the genders and according to the BF marker or measurement assessed ; higher intensity  PA  leads to a greater effect  against BF gain  in both genders ; and the maintenance or  increase of  PA  level on BF  observed through analysis of change in  PA  level yielded more consistent findings in the relation between  PA  and BF."
 To our knowledge this will be the first attempt to systematic ally identify  knowledge  of  dance  as a potential intervention for  adults with fibromyalgia .  This scoping review offers a feasible means for describing the evidence specific to  dance  and fibromyalgia ; results will provide unique insights concerning the breadth and depth of literature in the area . An analysis of this body of literature as a whole may reveal new research directions or unknown ways this intervention could strengthen current management approaches of the disease.
"sWe developed an evidence -based practice guideline to support  occupational safety and health ( OSH ) professionals  in assessing the  risk due to lifting  and in selecting effective  preventive  measures  for low back pain ( LBP ) in  the  Netherl and s.  The guideline was developed at the request of the Dutch government by a project team of  experts and OSH professionals in lifting and work-related LBP .  The recommendations for risk assessment were based on the  quality of instruments to assess the risk  on LBP due to lifting . Recommendations for interventions were based on a systematic review of the effects of  worker- and work directed interventions  to reduce back load due to lifting . The quality of the evidence was rated as strong ( A ) , moderate ( B ) , limited ( C ) or based on consensus ( D ) . Finally ,  eight experts and twenty-four OSH professionals  commented on and evaluated the content and the feasibility of the preliminary guideline . For risk assessment we recommend loads heavier than 25 kg always to be considered a risk for LBP while loads less than 3 kg do not pose a risk . For loads between 3–25 kg , risk assessment shall be performed using the Manual  h and ling Assessment Charts  (MAC)-Tool or National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) lifting equation . Effective work oriented interventions are  patient lifting devices  ( Level A ) and  lifting devices  for goods ( Level C ) , optimizing  working height  ( Level A ) and reducing  load mass  ( Level C ) . Ineffective work oriented preventive measures are regulations to ban lifting without proper alternatives ( Level D ) . We do not recommend worker-oriented interventions but consider personal lift assist devices as promising ( Level C ) . Ineffective worker-oriented preventive measures are  training in lifting technique  ( Level A ) ,  use of back-belts  ( Level A ) and  pre-employment medical examinations  ( Level A ) . This multidisciplinary evidence -based practice guideline gives clear criteria whether an  employee  is at risk for LBP while lifting and provides an easy-reference for (in)effective  risk reduction  measures based on scientific evidence , experience , and consensus among OSH experts and practitioners."

"yObjective : Persistent long-term benefits after discontinuation of treatment have been suggested for  blood pressure-lowering and lipid-lowering treatment .  We conducted a systematic review to assess the long-term effects of   blood pressure ( BP ) lowering ( BPL )  and lipid lowering  on  all-cause and  cardiovascular mortality  after discontinuation of r and omized treatment  . Methods : We systematic ally search ed Medline , Embase , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . We included  large-scale r and omized controlled trials of  BPL or lipid lowering  of at least 1 year with post-trial follow-up .  We identified  13  BPL  trials with 48 892 participants and 10  lipid-lowering  trials with 71 370 participants .  Mean in-trial and post-trial follow-up was approximately 4 and 6 years , respectively . Results :  BP and lipid levels  tended to come together soon in the post-trial period . There was significant benefit of  BPL  on  all-cause mortality  during the in-trial period ( relative risk 0.85 , 95 % confidence interval 0.81–0.89 ) , and significant , but attenuated , benefit during overall follow-up ( 0.91 , 0.87–0.94 ) . Likewise ,  lipid lowering with statins  reduced  the risk of all-cause mortality  during the in-trial period ( 0.88 , 0.81–0.95 ) , and this effect persisted during overall follow-up ( 0.92 , 0.87–0.97 ) . Similar findings were observed for  cardiovascular death .  In BPL trials , the cumulative  reduction in all-cause mortality  was significantly lower in trials with at least 5 years of post-trial follow-up compared with those with less than 5 years , and a similar tendency was observed for lipid-lowering trials . Conclusion : Benefits of  BPL  and  lipid lowering  on  all-cause and cardiovascular mortality  were persistent , but attenuated , after discontinuation of r and omized treatment , indicating the importance of continuing therapy."
"]Background The purpose was to : 1 ) perform a systematic review of studies examining the relation between physical activity , fitness , and health in  school-aged children and youth  , and 2 ) make recommendations based on the findings . Methods The systematic review was limited to 7 health indicators : high blood cholesterol , high blood pressure , the metabolic syndrome , obesity , low bone density , depression , and injuries . Literature search es were conducted using predefined keywords in 6 key data bases . A total of  11,088 potential papers were identified .  The abstract s and full-text articles of potentially relevant papers were screened to determine eligibility . Data was abstract ed for 113 outcomes from  the 86 eligible papers .  The evidence was grade d for each health outcome using established criteria based on the quantity and quality of studies and strength of effect . The volume , intensity , and type of physical activity were considered . Results  Physical activity  was associated with numerous  health benefits .  The dose-response relations observed in observational studies indicate that the more physical activity , the greater the  health benefit .  Results from experimental studies indicate that even modest amounts of physical activity can have  health benefits  in high-risk youngsters ( e.g. , obese ) . To achieve substantive health benefits , the  physical activity  should be of at least a moderate intensity . Vigorous intensity activities may provide even greater benefit . Aerobic-based activities had the greatest  health benefit  , other than for  bone health  , in which case high-impact weight bearing activities were required . Conclusion The following recommendations were made : 1 )  Children and youth 5 - 17 years of age  should accumulate an average of at least 60 minutes per day and up to several hours of at least moderate intensity  physical activity  . Some of the health benefits can be achieved through an average of 30 minutes per day . [ Level 2 , Grade A ] . 2 ) More  vigorous intensity activities  should be incorporated or added when possible , including activities that strengthen muscle and bone [ Level 3 , Grade B ] . 3 )  Aerobic activities  should make up the majority of the physical activity .  Muscle and bone strengthening activities  should be incorporated on at least 3 days of the week [ Level 2 , Grade A ]."
"sObesity and Consequences The prevalence of overweight and obesity has reached epidemic proportion , with the recent figures from the World Health Organization indicating that in 2016 39 % of  adults aged ≥18 years ( 39 % of men and 40 % of women ) were overweight and 13 % ( 11 % of men and 15 % of women ) obese  . The World Health Organization states that raised body mass index ( BMI ) is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases ( mainly heart disease and stroke ) , which were the leading causes of death in 2012 , diabetes mellitus , musculoskeletal disorders , and some cancers . The Framingham Heart Study data have indicated that overweight and obesity are associated with significantly decreased life expectancy . Nevertheless , and against these strong evidence s , the relationship between  BMI  and  mortality  has been challenged by several studies , indicating a survival advantages for those who are overweight and class I obese . However , the determinants of these observations are poorly understood and continue to be debated because BMI may not be the ideal index of adiposity and fat distribution and fitness and disease prevention may obscure the link between  BMI  and mortality . Overweight or obesity is not always accompanied by traditional risk factors . In fact , a systematic review and meta analysis revealed that about 35 % of  obese individuals  are  metabolically healthy  . A large study indicated that general or abdominal obesity , in the absence of metabolic risk factors , was not associated  with mortality risk  compared with lean individuals . These data differed from those of the Health Improvement Network , which comprised a cohort  of 3.5 million individuals  revealing that during a mean follow-up of 5.4 years , obese individuals with no metabolic abnormalities had a  higher risk of coronary heart disease , cerebrovascular disease , and heart failure  compared with healthy normalweight individuals . This indicates that even in the absence of metabolic abnormalities , overweight and obesity are not innocuous , perhaps because the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are either not present early or remain undetected using routine clinical assessment . This raises the concept that early or sub clinical organ damage assessment s may be better at identifying subjects who are more likely to progress to develop cardiovascular disease . There is evidence that an important factor driving at least some of the obesity-associated end-organ damage is overactivity of the  sympathetic nervous system  ( SNS ) , an observation that suggests that targeting SNS in obesity may help reduce the  cardiovascular risk  associated with obesity . In this review , we highlight the current knowledge of the potential role of SNS function in  obesity-induced organ  damage and examine whether interventions aim ed at  reducing cardiovascular risk in obesity  may be mediated via alterations in SNS activity . While not discounting the important and prolific pre clinical data on this subject , our review is primarily focused on recent observations from human trials."

"yThis systematic review examines critically the scientific basis for  Canada  's  Physical Activity  Guide for  Healthy Active Living for adults .  Particular reference is given to the dose-response relationship between  physical activity  and  premature all-cause mortality  and seven  chronic diseases ( cardiovascular disease  , stroke  , hypertension  ,  colon cancer  ,  breast cancer , type 2 diabetes ( diabetes mellitus ) and osteoporosis )  . The strength of the relationship between  physical activity  and specific health outcomes is evaluated critically . Literature was obtained through search ing electronic data bases ( e.g. , MEDLINE , EMBASE ) , cross-referencing , and through the authors ' knowledge of the area .  For  inclusion in our systematic review  articles must have at least 3 levels of physical activity and the concomitant risk for each chronic disease  . The quality of included studies was appraised using a modified Downs and Black tool . Through this search we identified  a total of 254 articles that met the eligibility criteria related to  premature all-cause mortality  ( N = 70 ) , cardiovascular disease ( N = 49 ) , stroke ( N = 25 ) , hypertension ( N = 12 ) , colon cancer ( N = 33 ) , breast cancer ( N = 43 ) , type 2 diabetes ( N = 20 ) , and osteoporosis ( N = 2 ) .  Overall , the current literature supports clearly the  dose-response relationship  between  physical activity  and the seven chronic conditions identified . Moreover , higher levels of  physical activity  reduce the  risk for premature all-cause mortality .  The current Canadian guidelines appear to be appropriate to reduce the  risk  for the seven chronic conditions identified above and all-cause mortality."
" The results of this systematic review suggested that NiTi rotary instruments were  associated with lower canal transportation and apical extrusion  when compared  to SST h  and files , whereas both groups had similar outcomes in terms  of success of therapy , amount of residual bacteria , and cleansing ability  after treatment .

"sAlthough  beta blockers  have been used as initial therapy for ischemic  heart diseases  and heart failure , the beneficial effects of beta blockers are controversial compared with other antihypertensive agents as initial therapy for hypertension without compelling indications . Moreover ,  atenolol  has been most commonly used with beta blockers  .  The objective of the present systematic review associated with the Japanese Society of Hypertension ( JSH ) 2019 Hypertension Guideline ( Clinical Question 6 ) was to assess the  outcomes ( cardiocerebrovascular mortality , total cause mortality , hypotension , bradycardia , other adverse effects , and changes in systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) )  of currently used  carvedilol and bisoprolol  as initial therapy for  adult hypertension  without compelling indications . Two independent systematic review ers search ed r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) up to October 2017 in the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE Ovid , EMBASE Ovid , and Clinical Trials.gov . Finally ,  eight RCTs with 2494 participants were identified  to meet our inclusion criteria . There were no RCTs in which  cardiocerebrovascular mortality , total cause mortality , hypotension , and bradycardia  were assessed between  carvedilol or bisoprolol  and  placebo  .  SBP-lowering effects  were significantly increased for  bisoprolol  compared with  placebo  . Here , 50 mg  carvedilol  significantly  reduced SBP  compared with placebo , whereas 12.5 mg or 25 mg did not . Regarding  adverse effects  , no differences were noted between  carvedilol  and placebo ( two RCTs , 286 participants , moderate certainly evidence ) . In conclusion , current evidence does not support  carvedilol or bisoprolol  as first-line therapy for  adult hypertension  without compelling indications."
"  Psychological therapy  based on CBT principles is effective in reducing  anxiety symptoms  for short-term treatment of GAD .

"rHome-based  resistance exercise  is commonly used for  individuals who might not have access or the ability to use traditional  resistance exercise .   However , the extent to which  home-based resistance exercise  can improve both  strength and functional ability  has not been investigated in  healthy older individuals  using a systematic analysis . The current article systematic ally review ed the effectiveness of  home-based resistance exercise  on strength and functional ability . Search engines included Academic Search Premier , CINAHL , PubMed , PsycINFO , MEDLINE , SPORTD iscus and Web of Science . A total of  649 articles were found using  the  key words "" home-based "" and "" strength "" and "" older "" or "" elderly ""  , with  eight articles meeting the final criteria  .  The average age of the participants was 76 years , with the average duration of  exercise training  ranging from 8 weeks to 120 weeks .  Of the eight studies , a significant  increase in knee extension strength  was found in five  studies . Functional ability  significantly improved in seven of the eight studies , with the average decrease  in Timed Up & Go test  being -0.8 ± 0.5 s. Three studies included greater amounts of  supervised visits  compared with the other five studies ( ∼51 % vs ∼7 % ) . The more supervised studies had  significant increases in strength and functional ability  .  Overall , home-based resistance exercise   can improve both strength and functional ability  , but the improvements are generally small . The intensity of the exercises might not progress sufficiently enough to produce large  improvements in strength  as a result of less supervision or a lack of motivation to increase the intensity further."
 At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target ( less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg ) or a lower BP target ( less than 140/90 mmHg ) is better for  older adults with high BP .  Additional good- quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.
"yGrowing evidence underlines the pivotal role of infant gut colonization in the development of the immune  system  . The possibility to modify gut colonization through  probiotic supplementation  in childhood might prevent  atopic diseases .  The aim of the present systematic review and meta- analysis was to evaluate the effect of  probiotic supplementation  during pregnancy and early infancy in preventing  atopic diseases  . PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Library were search ed for r and omized controlled trials evaluating the use of  probiotics  during  pregnancy or early infancy  for prevention of  allergic diseases .  Fixed-effect models were used , and r and om-effects models where significant heterogeneity was present . Results were expressed as risk ratio ( RR ) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) .  Seventeen studies , reporting data from 4755 children ( 2381 in the probiotic group and 2374 in the control group ) , were included in the meta- analysis . Infants treated with  probiotics   had a significantly  lower RR for eczema  compared to controls ( RR 0.78 [ 95 % CI : 0.69 - 0.89 ] , P = 0.0003 ) , especially those supplemented with a mixture of probiotics ( RR 0.54 [ 95 % CI : 0.43 - 0.68 ] , P < 0.00001 ) . No significant difference in  terms of prevention of asthma  ( RR 0.99 [ 95 % CI : 0.77 - 1.27 ] , P = 0.95 ) ,  wheezing  ( RR 1.02 [ 95 % CI : 0.89 - 1.17 ] , P = 0.76 ) or  rhinoconjunctivitis  ( RR 0.91 [ 95 % CI : 0.67 - 1.23 ] , P = 0.53 ) was documented .

"’Background There is growing interest in having objective assessment of  health-related outcomes  using  technology-based devices  that provide unbiased measurements which can be used in clinical practice and scientific research . Many studies have investigated the clinical manifestations of  Parkinson ’s  disease using such devices . However , clinimetric properties and clinical validation vary among the different devices . Methods Given such heterogeneity , we sought to perform a systematic review in order to ( i ) list , ( ii ) compare and ( iii ) classify  technological-based devices  used to measure motor  function  in  individuals with Parkinson 's disease  into three groups , namely  wearable , non-wearable  and  hybrid devices .

For each device we review ed availability , use , reliability , validity , and sensitivity to change . The devices were then classified as ( i ) ‘ recommended ’ , ( ii ) ‘ suggested ’ or ( iii ) ‘ listed ’ based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) used in the assessment of Parkinson ’s disease ( yes/no ) , ( 2 ) used in published studies by people other than the developers ( yes/no ) , and ( 3 ) successful clinimetric testing ( yes/no ) . Results  Seventy-three devices were identified , 22 were wearable , 38 were non-wearable , and 13 were hybrid devices .  In accordance with our classification method , 9 devices were ‘ recommended ’ , 34 devices were ‘ suggested ’ , and 30 devices were classified as ‘ listed ’ . Within the wearable devices group , the  Mobility Lab sensors from Ambulatory Parkinson ’s Disease Monitoring ( APDM ) , Physilog ® , StepWatch 3 , TriTrac RT3 Triaxial accelerometer , McRoberts DynaPort , and Axivity  ( AX3 ) were classified as ‘ recommended ’ . Within the non-wearable devices group , the  Nintendo Wii Balance Board and GAITRite ® gait analysis  system were classified as ‘ recommended ’ . Within the hybrid devices group only the Kinesia ® system was classified as ‘ recommended ’."

"dPURPOSE  OnabotulinumtoxinA ( BoNT-A )  is a promising therapy for treating  neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( NDO ) in individuals with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .  This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to carry out an in-depth review and to make an objective estimation of the efficacy and safety of  BoNT-A  on NDO after SCI . METHODS The PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane data bases were search ed for  all relevant articles published from 2001 to 2016 that referred to NDO , SCI , and  BoNT-A or botulinum toxin A.   All data were recorded in an Excel spreadsheet by 2 individual review ers . Review Manager version 5.3 was used to carry out the meta- analysis . RESULTS This analysis included  17 studies involving 1,455 patients .  Compared with placebo and baseline ,  BoNT-A  was effective in increasing  maximum cystometric capacity , volume at first involuntary detrusor contraction , cystometric bladder capacity  ( all P<0.00001 ) ,  compliance  ( P=0.001 ) , and the  number of patients with complete dryness  ( P=0.0003 ) , and  decreasing detrusor pressure , the number of patients with no involuntary detrusor contractions , the maximum flow rate , the incidence of detrusor overactivity  ( all P<0.00001 ) , and  the number of urinary incontinence episodes  ( P=0.001 ) . There were no statistically significant differences between doses of 200 U and 300 U or between injections into the detrusor and submucosa . There were  no life-threatening adverse events .    BoNT-A  is effective and safe in treating NDO after SCI . There were no statistically significant differences between doses of 200 U and 300 U or between injecting into the detrusor and submucosa . However , more high- quality r and omized controlled trials are still needed."
"mObjective This study was performed to compare the clinical efficacy between the  OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional manual surgery  in  patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty .  Methods The Embase , PubMed , CINAHL , and Cochrane data bases were search ed for clinical trials . The outcome measurements were the  anteversion angle , inclination angle , and complications .  Review Manager 5.3 statistical software was used for the data analysis . Results Significant differences were found in the  femoral offset and overall complication rate  between the conventional and navigation groups . Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less  anteversion  than the navigation group . However , the navigation group had significantly better  inclination .  The  operation time  was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group . Conclusion Both the  OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty  result in significant improvements in  patient function  with similar  overall complication rates  and have their own advantages in achieving good  cup  position . The  conventional  procedure has a shorter  operation time  than does use of a  navigation  system."

"gIn this month 's issue of European Urology , Russo et al. [ 1 ] published the results of a systematic review of the literature about the  efficacy  of  injection therapies , vacuum devices  , and  penile traction  in  patients with Peyronie 's disease ( PD ) .  The authors summarized available evidence about the effects of these therapeutic options on relevant outcomes such as  penile curvature ( PC ) , plaque size , erectile function , penile pain , and penile length  [ 1 ] . The study has two major method ological strengths . Most importantly , it is the first systematic review addressing the efficacy of  intralesional and mechanical therapies  in  PD patients .  A further strength of the study is the adoption of  PC improvement  as a primary outcome measure . This method ological choice confers to the results a strong clinical relevance as  PC  has been reported to be one of the major determinants of bother and psychological distress in  PD patients  [ 2 ] . It is important to depict the state of the art about  intralesional and mechanical therapies  for PD because the management of PD has strongly evolved over time . Historically ,  oral and intralesional therapies  have represented the initial conservative option with surgery being considered the definitive gold st and ard therapy in stable disease . More recently , recommended treatment algorithms have significantly shifted due to the introduction of potential new first-line options . In this scenario , oral  treatments  have become less commonly prescribed due to inconsistent or negative outcome data , and  intralesional therapies  have gained growing interest .  Interferon a-2b ( IFNa-2b )  was adopted for the first time in 1995 by Wegner et al. [ 3 ] . Initially , the results in terms of  PC  were  disappointing  , probably due to the inadequate dosage and regimen of the drug , or simply because of wrong."
"sBACKGROUND Decreased activity of the enzyme paraoxonase-1 ( PON1 ) has been demonstrated in  cardiovascular diseases .   Statins  , the forefront of pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia , have been shown to enhance PON1 activity but clinical findings have not been conclusive . OBJECTIVE To systematic ally review the clinical findings on the impact of  statin therapy  on PON1 status ( protein concentrations and activities of paraoxonase and arylesterase ) and calculate an effect size for the mentioned effects through meta- analysis of available data . METHODS  Scopus and  Medline data bases were search ed to identify clinical trials . A r and om-effects model and the generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis . Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the one- study remove approach . R and om-effects meta-regression was performed to assess the impact of potential confounders on the estimated effect sizes . RESULTS Meta- analysis suggested that  statin therapy  is associated with a significant  elevation  of  PON1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities  , but not  PON1 protein concentration .  The  PON1-enhancing effects  of  statins  were robust in the sensitivity analyses and were independent of statin dose , treatment duration and changes in  plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration .   The increase of  paraoxonase and arylesterase activities  with  statins  is a pleiotropic lipid-independent clinical benefit that may partly explain the putative effects of  statins  in preventing cardiovascular outcomes."

"DContext  Recombinant human GH ( rhGH )  is prescribed for the treatment of  adults with GH deficiency ( GHD ) .  However , conflicting data are available on the  efficacy  of  rhGH  treatment in  elderly GHD patients .  Objective To assess the efficacy of  rhGH  treatment in  elderly GHD subjects .  Methods We search ed the available literature in PubMed , Cochrane Library , Web of Science and EMBASE . Study selection  Studies on GHD patients , aged > 60 years , treated with  rhGH   were eligible for inclusion . Data extraction was performed by two review ers independently . Results We found  11 eligible studies with a total of 534 patients .  Only two studies had prospect i ve , r and omized , placebo-controlled study design s of  rhGH  treatment with a duration of 6 ( n=15 ) and 12 months ( n=62 ) , respectively . Treatment  with rhGH   decreased total and low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels  by 4 - 8 and 11 - 16 % , respectively , but did not  alter high density lipoprotein or triglyceride  levels  . RhGH  did not  affect body mass index  , but  decreased waist circumference  ( by ∼3 cm ) and waist/hip   ratio  . RhGh  did not consistently  affect blood pressure or bone mineral density  .  RhGH   increased lean body mass  by 2 - 5 % and  decreased total fat mass  by 7 - 10 % in four studies , but did not  affect body composition  in two other  studies . RhGH  consistently  improved quality of life ( QoL )  parameters reflected in AGHDA-scores . There were no explicit data on  elderly GHD patients aged > 80 years .   Conclusion RhGH  replacement in  elderly subjects with GHD   decreases LDL cholesterol levels  and  improves QoL  , but the effects on other parameters are not unequivocal . There were no data on the  efficacy and safety   of rhGH  treatment in octogenarians with GHD."

"yQUESTION Does  progressive resistance exercise  improve  strength and measures of physical performance  in  people with Parkinson 's disease  ? DESIGN Systematic review with meta- analysis of r and omised and quasi-r and omised controlled trials . PARTICIPANTS  People with Parkinson 's disease , regardless of gender or level of disability .  INTERVENTION  Progressive resistance exercise  , defined as  involving repetitive , strong , or effortful muscle contractions and progression of load  as the participant 's abilities changed . OUTCOME MEASURES  Measures of muscle strength ( maximum voluntary force production ) -  either  continuous ( force , torque , work , EMG )  or  ordinal ( manual muscle test )  - and  physical performance measures : sit-to-st and time , fast and comfortable walking speeds , 6-min walk test , stair descent and ascent , the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale , Timed Up and Go test , and the Short Physical Performance Battery .  RESULTS Four ( quasi- ) r and omised trials were included , three of which reported data that could be pooled in a meta- analysis .  Progressive resistance exercise  increased  strength  , with a st and ardised mean difference 0.50 ( 95 % CI 0.05 to 0.95 ) , and had a clinical ly worthwhile effect on  walking capacity  , with a mean difference of 96 metres ( 95 % CI 40 to 152 ) among  people  with  mild  to moderate Parkinson 's disease . However , most  physical performance outcomes  did not show clinical ly worthwhile improvement after  progressive resistance exercise .   This review suggests that  progressive resistance exercise  can be  effective and worthwhile  in  people with mild to moderate Parkinson 's disease  , but carryover of benefit does not occur for all measures of physical performance . The current evidence suggests that  progressive resistance training  should be implemented in Parkinson 's disease rehabilitation , particularly when the aim is to improve walking capacity."
 We recommend the initial use of  dapoxetine  30 mg OD for PE because it has been tested in largest and better design ed clinical trials rather than it is more effective than the other drugs studied . TAs and tramadol 50 mg OD can be used as a viable alternative to oral treatment with  SSRIs . PDE5is  combined  with SSRIs  are more  effective  than SSRIs monotherapy but are also associated with more  side effects  .  PDE5is  OD can be recommended to  PE patients  with ED.
"sINTRODUCTION  Physical activity ( PA )  is strongly endorsed for managing chronic conditions , and a vital sign tool ( indicator of general physical condition ) could alert providers of inadequate PA to prompt counseling or referral . This systematic review examined the use , definitions , psychometric properties , and outcomes of brief  PA  instruments as vital sign measures , with attention primarily to studies focused on arthritis . METHODS Electronic data bases were search ed for  English- language literature from 1985 through 2016  using the terms  PA , exercise , vital sign , exercise referral scheme  , and  exercise counseling .  Of  the 838 articles identified for title and abstract review , 9 articles qualified for full text review  and data extraction . RESULTS Five brief  PA  measures were identified  :  Exercise Vital Sign ( EVS ) , Physical Activity Vital Sign ( PAVS ) , Speedy Nutrition and Physical Activity Assessment ( SNAP ) , General Practice Physical Activity Question naire  ( GPPAQ ) , and  Stanford Brief Activity Survey  ( SBAS )  . Studies focusing on arthritis were not found . Over 1.5 years of using EVS in a large hospital system , improvements occurred  in relative weight loss  among overweight patients and reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin among diabetic patients . On PAVS , moderate physical activity of 5 or more days per week versus fewer than 5 days per week was associated with a  lower body mass index  ( -2.90 kg/m2 ) . Compared with accelerometer-defined physical activity , EVS was weakly correlated ( r = 0.27 ) , had low sensitivity ( 27%-59 % ) , and high specificity ( 74%-89 % ) ; SNAP showed weak agreement ( κ = 0.12 ) ; GPPAQ had moderate sensitivity ( 46 % ) and specificity ( 50 % ) , and SBAS was weakly correlated ( r = 0.10 - 0.28 ) , had poor to moderate sensitivity ( 18%-67 % ) , and had moderate specificity ( 58%-79 % ) .  Few studies have examined a brief  physical activity  tool as a vital sign measure . Initial investigations suggest the promise of these simple and quick assessment tools , and research is needed to test the effects of their use on chronic disease outcomes."

"mINTRODUCTION  Vegetable oil  is an important source of fatty acids , and as  palm oil  being the highest consumed vegetable oil in many countries , its high saturated fatty acid content has led many concerns on cardiometabolic health . Dietary fatty acids has also been linked to affect  glucose metabolism  and  insulin sensitivity .  This systematic review is aim ed at critically evaluating the available evidence on the association of  palm oil  with the biomarkers  of glucose metabolism  as compared to other vegetable oils . METHODS We systemically search ed PubMed , CENTRAL and Scopus up to June 2018 . We search ed for published interventional studies on biomarkers of  glucose metabolism  ( defined as  fasting glucose , fasting insulin , HOMA , 2-hour post  pr and ial glucose and HbA1C ) that compared  palm oil- or palm olein-rich diets with other edible vegetable oils ( such as olive oil , canola oil and soybean oil ) .  Two review ers independently extracted data and assessed study risks of bias . Mean differences of outcomes were pooled for the meta- analysis . RESULTS We identified  1921 potentially eligible articles with only eight included studies .  Seven r and omised cross-over trials and one parallel trial were included .  Study population were among young to middle-aged , healthy , non-diabetic , and normal weight participants .  Intervention duration ranged from three to seven weeks , and fat substitution ranged from 15 % to 20 % energy . There were insignificant differences in  fasting glucose  when compared to partially hydrogenated soybean oil [ -0.15mmol/L ( -0.46,0.16 ) P = 0.33 , I2 = 48 % ] ,  soybean oil  [ 0.05mmol/L ( -0.09,0.18 ) P = 0.49 , I2 = 0 % ] and olive  oil  [ 0.04mmol/L ( -0.09,0.17 ) P = 0.76 , I2 = 0 % ] . Insignificant effects were also seen on  fasting insulin  when compared to partially hydrogenated soybean oil [ 1.72pmol/L ( -11.39,14.84 ) P = 0.80 , I2 = 12 % ] and  olive oil  diet [ -0.14pmol/L ( -4.87,4.59 ) P = 0.95 , I2 = 0 % ] .  Current evidence on the effects of  palm oil  consumption on  biomarkers of glucose metabolism  is poor and limited to  only healthy participants .  We conclude that little or no additional benefit will be obtained by replacing  palm oil  with other oils rich in mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids for changes in glucose metabolism."
"sEpidemiological evidence suggests that  vitamin D  deficiency is associated with increased  mortality  , but it is unclear whether this is explained by reverse causation , and if there are specific causes of death for which  vitamin D  might be important . We conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating associations between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin  D  ( 25(OH)D ) concentration and  all-cause or cause-specific mortality in generally healthy population s.  Relevant studies were identified using PubMed and EMBASE search es . After  screening 722 unique records and removing those that were ineligible , 84 articles were included in this review .  The vast majority of studies reported inverse  associations between 25(OH)D concentration and all-cause mortality .  This association appeared to be non-linear , with progressively  lower mortality  with increasing 25(OH)D up to a point , beyond which there was no further decrease . There is moderate evidence that  vitamin D  status is inversely associated with  cancer mortality and death due to respiratory diseases  , while for  cardiovascular mortality  , there is weak evidence of an association in observational studies , which is not supported by the data from intervention or Mendelian r and omization studies . The relationship between  vitamin D  status and  other causes of death  remains uncertain due to limited data . Larger long-term studies are required to clarify these associations."
 Evidence was insufficient to show whether  exercise  is an  effective  treatment for  vasomotor menopausal symptoms .  One small study suggested that  HT  is more effective than  exercise .  Evidence was insufficient to show the relative effectiveness of  exercise  when compared with  HT  or yoga.
 Published RCTs have mostly been performed in  population  s  without low 25OHD levels  . The fact that most MAs on results from RCTs did not show a beneficial effect does not disprove the hypothesis suggested by observational findings on adverse health outcomes of low 25OHD levels.

"eAtherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease ( ASCVD ) affects more than 15 million Americans ( 1 ) and is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States ( 2 ) . Trials have demonstrated reductions in  low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels  ( 3 ) and decreased ASCVD risk with  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) monotherapy  ( 4 ) . Over the past decade ,  statins  have often been used in  combination with other lipid-modifying agents .  Recently , several high-profile r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) have evaluated add-on therapy ( 57 ) , wherein  statin monotherapy  is compared with the  combination of the same statin dose and another lipid-modifying agent .  Add-on combination therapy can lead to superior  lipid  outcomes , but studies have not shown decreased rates of  cardiovascular death , myocardial infa rct ion , revascularization , or stroke  ( 57 ) . Therefore , the 2013 American College of Cardiology ( ACC ) and American Heart Association ( AHA ) guidelines recommend moderate- or high-intensity  statin monotherapy  as the first-line strategy for ASCVD risk reduction among  patients with LDL cholesterol levels of 4.91 mmol/L or greater ( 190 mg/dL ) , preexisting ASCVD , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , or estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5 % or greater  ( 8) . Clinicians may find applying these new guidelines in clinical practice challenging , especially among patients who can not tolerate the recommended intensity of statin because of adverse effects or those who have limited LDL cholesterol response . Adverse effects are more common with higher-intensity  statin  regimens ( 9 ) , and musculoskeletal adverse events occur frequently among patients with the C variant in the SLCO1B1 gene ( 10 ) . Pharmacogenetic variability may also decrease  statin efficacy  ( 11 ) . Consequently , higher-intensity  statin monotherapy  may not be appropriate for all patients . The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines suggest that clinicians consider moderated  combination therapy with a lower-intensity statin and another lipid-modifying medication  among  high-risk patients ( LDL cholesterol level 4.91 mmol/L [ 190 mg/dL ] , preexisting ASCVD , or DM )  who are  intolerant of or unresponsive to statins  ( evidence grade E : expert opinion ) ( 8) . Yet , it is unclear whether this strategy results in similar  ASCVD risk reductions and fewer adverse effects  compared with  higher-intensity statin monotherapy .  A 2009 systematic review that examined these questions found insufficient evidence to weigh benefits and risks of moderated combination therapy ( 12 ) . We aim ed to compare the  effectiveness , safety , and tolerability  of  moderated combination therapy of statin with another lipid-modifying medication ( bile acid sequestrant , ezetimibe , fibrate , niacin , or -3 fatty acid ) with those of higher-intensity statin monotherapy  among  high-risk patients .  We sought to compare the long-term  clinical benefits  and  short-term lipid effects  of  moderated combination therapy with those of higher-intensity statin monotherapy  , as well as to determine whether these regimens differ in rates of adherence and harms . Methods We developed and publicly posted a protocol to conduct this review ( http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/ search -for-guides- review s- and -reports/?pageaction = displayproduct&productid=1496 ) , and the search strategies and detailed evidence tables are available online ( 13 ) . Given the recent release of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines ( 8) , we narrowed the scope of this manuscript to focus on evidence most relevant to  high-risk population s  for whom combination therapy might be considered . Data Sources and Search es We search ed MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for primary studies published from May 2008 through July 2013 . To up date our review , we search ed MEDLINE through November 2013 . We screened all articles included in the prior review ( 12 ) . We also review ed the reference lists of each included article , relevant review articles , relevant studies identified on Clinical Trials.gov , and scientific information packets provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers . Study Selection Two study team members independently screened each identified article against prespecified eligibility criteria ( Table 1 of the Supplement ) . We included RCTs in  adults with high ASCVD risk ( LDL cholesterol level 4.91 mmol/L [ 190 mg/dL ] , preexisting ASCVD , or DM ) ( 8)  that compared a  moderated combination regimen with higher-intensity statin monotherapy .  We excluded studies not reported in English . We also considered nonr and omized extensions of clinical trials of more than 24 weeks ' duration and U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports for evaluation of  long-term benefits , serious adverse events , and harms .  We anticipated that few trials of only statin-intolerant or statin-unresponsive patients would exist and therefore included studies of statin-tolerant and statin-responsive patients . Supplement . Tables Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Two team members extracted data on study design , setting , population characteristics , and intervention characteristics . Our long-term clinical outcomes included  mortality , acute coronary events , cerebrovascular events , and revascularization procedures .  Our lipid outcome was  LDL cholesterol level .  Investigator-defined outcomes included  adherence , serious adverse events , withdrawals due to adverse events , and occurrence of any adverse event .  Secondary harms outcomes included  elevations in liver aminotransferase levels , elevated measures of muscle-related harm (  for example ,  elevated creatine phosphokinase level or myalgia )  ,  acute kidney injury  , or  incident DM .  We rated the strength of evidence ( SOE ) by evaluating the risk of bias , consistency of results , directness , and precision . We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool ( 14 ) for  studies identified  in the  new search  and the Jadad score ( 15 ) for  studies  identified during the  prior review  . Two review ers independently assessed the risk of bias for each included study . We labeled results as consistent if most of the interventions ' point estimates favored  statin monotherapy or combination therapy .  Most outcomes were directly measured , except for  LDL cholesterol level  , which we considered to be indirect because the Friedewald equation may underestimate it among high-risk patients ( 16 ) . We assessed precision on the basis of the studies ' variance estimates and sufficiency of the sample size by comparing them to the optimal information size . To be rated as high-strength , the body of evidence would need to be rated as having low risk of bias and as being consistent , direct , and precise . We rated the SOE as moderate if 1 of these elements was down grade d. We rated the SOE as low if 2 or more of these elements were down grade d. Data Synthesis and Analysis The evidence base contained different statins and different  statin  doses both within and across studies , which limited our ability to make statin-specific comparisons . Prior studies have suggested schemes to group statins on the basis of their reported  LDL cholesterol reduction  ( 17 , 18 ) , which are similar to the strategy used by the ACC/AHA committee ( 8) . We used the strategy proposed by Weng and colleagues ( 18 ) to group statins when synthesizing data ( Table 2 of the Supplement ) . We compared moderated  combination therapy  with higher-intensity  statin monotherapy  among  high-risk patients with  LDL cholesterol levels  of 4.91 mmol/L or greater ( 190 mg/dL ) , preexisting ASCVD , or DM .  For all comparisons , we report the qualitative synthesis of data by calculating and displaying the individual mean differences with 95 % CIs ( if calculable ) for individual studies grouped by combination therapy agent , statin intensity ,  and high-risk population .  For studies with 2 monotherapy groups of the same intensity , we used only 1 group as the comparator to the combination groups according to a priori criteria . If the groups involved the same statin , we used the group with the higher dose . If the groups involved different statins , we selected the group according to prioritized  statin  agent  ( rosuvastatin , atorvastatin , simvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , and fluvastatin ; no studies used pitavastatin )  . We performed no meta-analyses given the small number of heterogeneous trials . Role of the Funding Source Funding was provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality . The funding source had no role in study selection , quality assessment , or data synthesis or in the decision to su bmi t the manuscript for publication . Results The Appendix Figure summarizes the search results , and Table 3 of the Supplement lists all included studies . The literature search identified  4369 unique citations . We included 36 studies reported in 43 articles .  The Table summarizes the study and population characteristics of included studies by combination agent and by population . All trials were RCTs . No nonr and omized extensions of clinical trials greater than 24 weeks ' duration and U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports met our inclusion criteria .

"nBackground There has been a growing interest in the role of the  private for-profit sector  in health service provision in  low- and middle-income countries .  The private sector represents an important source of care for all socioeconomic groups , including the poorest and substantial concerns have been raised about the quality of care it provides . Interventions have been developed to address these technical failures and simultaneously take advantage of the potential for involving private providers to achieve public health goals . Limited information is available on the extent to which these interventions have successfully exp and ed access to quality health services for  poor and disadvantaged population s.  This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting the results of a systematic literature review on the effectiveness of working with  private for-profit providers  to reach the  poor .  Methods The search topic of the systematic literature review was the effectiveness of interventions working with the  private for-profit  sector to improve  utilization  of  quality health  services by the poor . Interventions included  social marketing , use of vouchers , pre-packaging of drugs , franchising , training , regulation , accreditation and contracting-out .  The search for published literature used a series of electronic data bases including PubMed , Popline , HMIC and CabHealth Global Health . The search for grey and unpublished literature used documents available on the World Wide Web . We focused on studies which evaluated the impact of interventions on  utilization and /or quality of services  and which provided information on the socioeconomic status of the beneficiary population s. Results A total of  2483 references were retrieved  , of which  52 qualified as impact evaluations .  Data were available on the average  socioeconomic  status of recipient communities for 5 interventions , and on the distribution of benefits across socioeconomic groups for 5 interventions . Conclusion Few studies provided evidence on the impact of  private sector interventions  on  quality and /or utilization of care  by the poor . It was , however , evident that many interventions have worked successfully in poor communities and positive  equity impacts  can be inferred from interventions that work with types of providers predominantly used by poor people . Better evidence of the  equity impact  of interventions working with the private sector is needed for more robust conclusions to be drawn."
"tNutritively  sweetened beverages ( NSBs )  may play a role in the obesity epidemic . We abstract ed data from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and evidence -based review s through January 2009 concerning effects of consumption of  NSBs  on changes in  body weight and adiposity .   Studies included were those ( i ) conducted in humans ; ( ii ) lasting at least 3 weeks ; ( iii ) incorporating  r and om assignment of  subjects  to conditions that differed only in the consumption of  NSBs  and ( iv ) including an adiposity indicator as an outcome .  Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria .  Meta- analysis of six studies that added  NSBs  to persons ' diets showed dose-dependent  increases in weight .  Contrarily , meta- analysis of studies that attempted to reduce  NSB  consumption consistently showed no effect on  body mass index ( BMI )  when all subjects were considered . Meta- analysis of studies providing access to results separately for subjects overweight at baseline showed a significant effect of a roughly 0.35 st and ard deviations lesser  BMI change  ( i.e. more  weight loss or less weight gain )  relative to controls . The current evidence does not demonstrate conclusively that  NSB  consumption has uniquely contributed to  obesity  or that reducing  NSB  consumption will reduce  BMI levels  in general . We recommend an adequately powered RCT with  overweight persons  , for whom there is suggestive evidence of an effect."
" The findings suggest that  oral supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics  has a small effect to  reduce waist circumference  but no effect  on body weight or BMI  , although the quality of evidence is low to moderate . Therefore , the current evidence is not definitive . Large-scale trials are needed and may help to better inform clinical practice .

"ePurpose While statins are used as first-line treatments for  high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia  ,  statin monotherapy  is often insufficient to achieve target  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) levels .  Second-line treatment options include up-titration of  statin  dose , switching to a more potent  statin  , or combination therapy , e.g. , with  ezetimibe .  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of adding  ezetimibe to simvastatin , atorvastatin , or rosuvastatin monotherapy  versus doubling the dosage or switching to a higher-potency statin in a  population of patients with hypocholesterolemia at high risk of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and who had been previously treated with a statin .  Methods A systematic literature search was performed and evidence bases were established for  population s of  atorvastatin- , simvastatin- , and rosuvastatin-experienced  patients using eligible r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs )  . Based on the available data , we constructed networks of evidence and conducted a Bayesian network meta- analysis ( NMA ) within each statin population . The primary outcome of interest was  percent change from baseline in LDL-C. Changes in total cholesterol  were explored as a secondary outcome . Findings Across  all patient population s  ,  35 RCTs  were identified and included in the evidence base . Among  patients  on simvastatin therapy   , the addition of  ezetimibe  result ed in a mean difference ( MD )  in LDL-C  of − 13.62 % ( 95 % CrI − 19.99 , − 6.91 ; see table below ) compared to doubling the starting dose of  simvastatin  . In the population of  patients on  atorvastatin  therapy  , the addition of  ezetimibe  result ed in an  MD in LDL-C  of − 14.71 % ( 95 % CrI − 16.46 , − 12.95 ) compared to doubling the starting dose of  atorvastatin  . The addition of  ezetimibe  to  rosuvastatin  result ed in an  MD in LDL-C  of − 14.96 % ( 95 % CrI − 17.79 , − 12.11 ) , compared to doubling the starting  rosuvastatin  dose . Similar trends were observed for  changes in total cholesterol .  Implication sGiven the available data , the addition of  ezetimibe  to ongoing  simvastatin , atorvastatin , or rosuvastatin  monotherapy offers greater reduction in  LDL-C  among  patients at high risk of CVD  compared to doubling the initial statin dose."
" Compared  with high-dose statin therapy , ezetimibe with low-dose statin  for more than 3 months may have a beneficial tendency of effects on glycemic control."
" Considering the public health importance of obesity and its consequences ; the clearly relevant role of diet in the pathogenesis and maintenance of obesity ; and the billions of dollars spent  on non-caloric sweeteners  , little high- quality clinical research has been done . Studies are needed to determine the role  of hypocaloric sweeteners  in a wider population health strategy to prevent , reduce and manage obesity and its consequences."
"sBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Guidelines for st and ardization of   radiostereometry ( RSA )   of  implants  were published in 2005 to facilitate comparison of outcomes between various research groups . In this systematic review , we determined how well studies have adhered to these guidelines . METHODS We carried out a literature search to identify  all articles published between January 2000 and December 2011 that used  RSA  in the evaluation of hip or knee prosthesis migration .  2 investigators independently evaluated each of the studies for adherence to the 13 individual guideline items . Since some of the 13 points included more than 1 criterion , studies were assessed on whether each point was fully met , partially met , or not met . RESULTS  153 studies that met our inclusion criteria were identified .  61 of these were published before the guidelines were introduced ( 2000 - 2005 ) and 92 after the guidelines were introduced ( 2006 - 2011 ) . The  method ological quality of  RSA  studies  clearly improved from 2000 to 2011 . None of the studies fully met all 13 guidelines . Nearly half ( 43 ) of the studies published after the guidelines demonstrated a  high method ological quality  and adhered at least partially to 10 of the 13 guidelines , whereas less than one-fifth ( 11 ) of the studies published before the guidelines had the same method ological  quality  . Commonly unaddressed guideline items were related to  imaging methodology , determination of precision from double examinations , and also mean error of rigid-body fitting and condition number cutoff levels .  INTERPRETATION The guidelines have improved  method ological reporting  in RSA studies , but adherence to these guidelines is still relatively low . There is a need to up date and clarify the guidelines for clinical hip and knee arthroplasty RSA studies."
"nBackground Aging sarcopenia characterized by low muscle mass with low muscle strength affects men and women differently . The contribution of  interleukin-6  ( IL-6 ) to sarcopenia has been suggested based on a negative correlation between plasma IL-6 and muscle function described by some studies . However , no consensus regarding clinical ly relevant cut-off criteria has been reached . Another question arises whether pooling male and female data is an accurate way to determine the predictive value of IL-6 in sarcopenia . The present meta- analysis was design ed to assess : ( 1 ) whether plasma IL-6 in aged population s in fact correlates negatively to  muscle  strength ; ( 2 ) whether such a correlation exists both in men and in women ; and ( 3 ) whether plasma IL-6 shows a gender difference in old age . Methods We applied the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta- analysis protocol s ( PRISMA ) . We search ed PubMed  and  Embase for  papers that reported data on individuals over 65 without inflammatory diseases .  We extracted either separate male and female data on plasma IL-6 along with at least one muscle parameter or correlation coefficient between plasma IL-6 and these parameters . R and om effect models calculated with DerSimonian and Laird weighting methods were applied to analyze correlation coefficients and gender difference in plasma IL-6 .  Egger ’s  test was used to assess the small study effect . Results  Twenty articles out of 468 records identified were suitable  for  analyses   . Plasma IL-6  correlates negatively  with grip strength  in mixed population s and also separately in men [ − 0.25 with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : − 0.48 , − 0.02 ] and in women ( − 0.14 with 95 % CI : − 0.24 , − 0.03 ) . However , contrary to expectations , men with better muscle condition have  higher plasma IL-6  than women of similar age with worse muscle condition ( plasma IL-6 male – female difference : 0.25 pg/mL with 95 % CI : 0.15 , 0.35 ) . Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that a higher predictive  IL-6  cut-off level should be determined for aging sarcopenia in men than in women."
"dIn the light of the importance of the impacts that obesity and physical activity may have on   blood pressure ( BP )  among adolescents  , and the suggestion that abnormal pressure levels at young ages are maintained into more mature stages of these individuals ' lives , the scope of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the associations between obesity and BP and between  physical  activity  and BP among adolescents .  The PubMed data base was consulted to search for scientific articles relating to this topic and , after applying the appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria ,  30 articles  were selected and analyzed . To assess the quality of articles Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology was applied . The results suggest that despite the existence of hegemonic thinking to guide these  relationships  ,  BP and physical activity  do not always have negative associations , and  BP and obesity  do not always have positive associations . The conclusion reached is that this situation illustrates the need for more in-depth reflection on these relationships before pre-established paradigms are passively accepted."
" There was very low quality evidence that in  patients with moderate to severe hypertension  , partial agonists lowered  peak BP  by an average of 8/4 mmHg and reduced  heart rate  by five beats per minute . There was no evidence of a greater effect at doses higher than the initial doses . This estimate was probably exaggerated as it was subject to a high risk of bias . Based on the indirect comparison of the results in this review and two Cochrane review s on  angiotensin-converting-enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs )  , which also used similar inclusion criteria as this review , the  BP lowering effect  appeared to be less than the effect in  patients with mild to moderate elevated BP  who were taking  ACE  inhibitors   and  ARBs  based on an indirect comparison . Withdrawals due to adverse effects were only reported in one trial so it is impossible to assess the harm of these drugs."
" Studies revealed both  structural and functional alterations in bladders  from  patients with LUTS symptoms or animals with experimentally induced bladder dysfunction .  In particular , the urothelium and the suburothelial space , containing afferent nerve fibres and interstitial cells , have been found to form a functional unit that is essential in the process of bladder function . Various imbalances within this suburothelial complex have been identified as significant contributors to the generation of storage LUTS , along with potential abnormalities of central function."
"sAIM To systematic ally review the literature for in vitro studies that evaluated the immediate or after ageing bond strength of   etch- and -rinse and self-etch adhesive systems  to enamel and  dentin  of  primary  teeth .  DESIGN The search was conducted in PubMed / MEDLINE , Cochrane , SciELO , Lilacs , and Scopus data bases with no publication year or language limits , following the preferred reporting items for systematic review s and meta-analyses ( PRISMA ) statement .  From 459 potentially eligible studies , 39 were selected for full-text analysis , and 5 were identified in reference lists , with 36 considered in the meta- analysis .  Two review ers independently selected the studies , extracted the data , and assessed the risk of bias . Pooling bond strength data was calculated using r and om effects analysis method , comparing two categories of  adhesives ( etch- and -rinse versus self-etch systems )  when applied in different types and conditions of substrate ( α = 0.05 ) . RESULTS  No statistical significant difference in bond strength  between both  categories was observed in caries-affected dentin at immediate evaluation  and  in sound  dentin  after  ageing  . Etch- and -rinse adhesives  , however ,  performed better  in sound enamel and dentin substrates considering immediate bond strength . None study assessed  the long-term adhesive effectiveness to sound or demineralized enamel  .  Although the articles included in this meta- analysis showed high heterogeneity and high risk of bias , the in vitro literature suggests superior performance  of etch- and -rinse adhesives  in  primary teeth  in comparison with self-etch systems."
"hBackground : The literature examining the effects of  workstation , eyewear and behavioral interventions  on   musculoskeletal and visual symptoms  among computer users  is large and heterogeneous . Methods : A systematic review of the literature used a best evidence synthesis approach to address the general question “ Do  office interventions  among  computer users  have an effect on  musculoskeletal  or  visual health  ? ” This was followed by an evaluation of specific interventions . Results : The initial search identified  7313 articles  which were reduced to  31  studies based on content and quality . Overall , a mixed level of evidence was observed for the general question . Moderate evidence was observed for : ( 1 )  no effect of workstation adjustment  , ( 2 )  no effect of rest breaks and exercise  and ( 3 )  positive effect of alternative  pointing  devices  .   For all other interventions mixed or insufficient evidence of effect was observed . Conclusion : Few high quality studies were found that examined the effects of interventions in the office on musculoskeletal or visual health."
"dSummary This systematic review summarizes the effect of  combined exercise and nutrition intervention  on  muscle mass and muscle function  . A total of  37 RCTs  were identified . Results indicate that  physical exercise  has a positive impact on  muscle mass and muscle function  in  subjects aged 65 years and older .  However , any interactive effect of dietary supplementation appears to be limited . Introduction In 2013 , Denison et al. conducted a systematic review including  17 r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs )  to explore the effect of  combined exercise and nutrition intervention  to improve muscle mass , muscle strength , or physical performance in  older people .  They concluded that further studies were needed to provide evidence upon which public health and clinical recommendations could be based . The purpose of the present work was to up date the prior systematic review and include studies published up to October 2015 . Methods Using the electronic data bases MEDLINE and EMBASE , we identified RCTs which assessed the combined effect of  exercise training and nutritional supplementation  on muscle strength , muscle mass , or physical performance in  subjects aged 60 years and over .  Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent review ers . Results The search strategy identified  21 additional RCTs  giving a total of  37  RCTs . Studies were heterogeneous in terms of protocol s  for physical exercise and dietary supplementation  ( proteins , essential amino acids , creatine , β-hydroxy-β-methylbuthyrate , vitamin D , multi-nutrients , or other ) . In 79 % of the studies ( 27/34  RCTs ) , muscle mass  increased with exercise but an additional effect of nutrition was only found in 8 RCTs (  23.5 % ) . Muscle strength  increased in 82.8 % of the studies ( 29/35 RCTs ) following  exercise  intervention , and  dietary  supplementation showed additional benefits in only a small number of studies ( 8/35 RCTS , 22.8 % ) . Finally , the majority of studies showed an  increase of physical performance  following exercise intervention ( 26/28 RCTs , 92.8 % ) but interaction with  nutrition  supplementation was only found in 14.3 % of these studies ( 4/28 RCTs ) . Conclusion  Physical exercise  has a positive  impact on muscle mass and muscle function  in  healthy subjects aged 60 years and older .  The biggest effect of exercise intervention , of any type , has been seen on  physical performance ( gait speed , chair rising test , balance , SPPB test , etc . )  . We observed huge variations in regard to the  dietary  supplementation protocol s. Based on the included studies , mainly performed on well-nourished  subjects  , the interactive effect of  dietary supplementation  on muscle function appears limited."
" The  MCID  in acute pain varied greatly between studies and was influenced by baseline pain , definitions of improved patients and study design .  MCID  is context -specific and potentially misguiding if determined , applied or interpreted inappropriately . Explicit and conscientious reflections on the choice of a reference value are required when using  MCID  to classify research results as clinical ly important or trivial."
" We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause  mortality  is similar when first-line  RAS inhibitors  are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents . First-line thiazides caused less  HF and stroke  than first-line  RAS  inhibitors . The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line  RAS inhibitors  was low and the lower risk of  total CV events and stroke  seen with  RAS inhibitors  may change with the publication of additional trials . Compared with first-line CCBs , first-line  RAS inhibitors  reduced  HF  but increased  stroke .  The magnitude of the reduction in  HF  exceeded the increase in  stroke .  The small differences in effect on  blood pressure  between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes."
"sProbiotic  supplementation  reduces the risk of  necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) and late-onset sepsis ( LOS )   in preterm infants  , but it remains to be determined whether this reduction translates into a reduction of other  complications .  We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the possible role of  probiotics  in altering the  risk of  bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) .  Fifteen r and omized controlled trials ( 4782 infants ;  probiotics :  2406 ) were included .  None of the included studies assessed  BPD  as the primary outcome . Meta- analysis confirmed a significant reduction  of NEC  ( risk ratio ( RR ) 0.52 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.33 to 0.81 , p = 0.004 ; r and om effects model ) , and an almost significant  reduction  of  LOS  ( RR 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.65 to 1.03 , p = 0.084 ) . In contrast , meta- analysis could not demonstrate a significant effect  of probiotics on BPD  , defined either as  oxygen dependency  at 28 days of life ( RR 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.91 to 1.11 , p = 0.900 , 6 studies ) or at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age ( RR 1.07 , 95 % CI 0.96 to 1.20 , p = 0.203 , 12 studies ) . Meta-regression did not show any significant association  between the RR for NEC or LOS and the RR for BPD .  In conclusion , our results suggest that  NEC and LOS prevention  by probiotics does  not affect the risk of developing BPD  in preterm infants."
"eRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the development of osseous and cartilaginous damage . The correct differentiation between a true erosion and other entities — then often called “ pseudoerosions”—is essential to avoid misdiagnosing  rheumatoid arthritis  and to correctly interpret the progress of the disease . The aims of this systematic review were as follows : to create a definition and delineation of the term “  pseudoerosion  ” , to point out morphological pitfalls in the interpretation of images , and to report on difficulties arising from choosing different imaging modalities . A systematic review on  bone erosions  in  rheumatoid arthritis  was performed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines . The following search terms were applied in PubMed and Scopus : “ rheumatoid arthritis ” , “  bone  erosion ” ,  “ ultrasonography ”  ,  “ radiography ”  ,  “ computed tomography ”  and  “ magnetic resonance imaging ”  . Appropriate exclusion criteria were defined . The systematic review registration number is 138826 . The search result ed ultimately in a final number of  25 papers  . All indications for  morphological  pitfalls and difficulties utilizing imaging modalities were recorded and summarized . A  pseudoerosion  is more than just a negative definition of an erosion ; it can be anatomic ( e.g. , a normal osseous concavity ) or artefact-related ( i.e. , an artificial interruption of the calcified zones ) . It can be classified according to their configuration , shape , content , and can be described specifically with an anatomical term . “ Calcified zone ” is a term to describe the deep components of the subchondral , subligamentous and subtendinous bone , and may be applied for all non-cancellous borders of a bone , thus representing a third type of the bone matrix beside the cortical and the trabecular bone."

"tBACKGROUND Previous trials have reported beneficial effects of  isolated and complex fiber supplements  in  obesity treatment  . However , recommending  fiber  supplements  in obese subjects  remains controversial . To the best of our knowledge , no systematic review has up date d the data on the effects of  fiber supplements  on obesity since 2010 and the need exists for a systematic review on this topic . Accordingly , a systematic review was undertaken to summarize the efficacy of different types of  fiber supplements  as a complementary treatment for weight management . METHODS We search ed PubMed , Scopus , Cochrane Library and Google Scholar between  January 2010 to August 2016  with no language restriction . Considering the inclusion /exclusion criteria and quality assessment score ,  finally 17 clinical trials met the eligibility criteria and were included .  RESULTS The present study indicated that the  efficacy  of various  fiber supplements  on  losing weight  is variable . Several mechanisms related to physicochemical properties of fibers such as  solubility  ,  fermentability  and  viscosity rates  can be involved in their anti-obesity  effects  . Dextrin , Mannan ( gum Arabic ) and pectin-rich fiber ( lupin kernel ) with no dietary interventions indicated a reduction in  body weight and energy intake  , while from clinical point of view , their effects were not considerable .  Overall , findings indicated that the efficacy of  fiber supplements  on  obesity  management is dependent on their contents and physicochemical properties . It seems that  fiber supplements  with no weight-loss interventions did not have considerable  antiobesity effects .  However , due to limited studies on each type of fiber , findings should be declared by caution . Additional research is needed on comparison of different  fiber supplements  in similar conditions to clarify the best type and dosage of  fiber supplement  as a complementary therapy in obesity management."
"sBACKGROUND Adherence difficulties and psychological problems are associated with poor  glycaemic  control   in  diabetes .  We undertook a systematic review and meta- analysis of  psychological therapies  to assess their effectiveness in improving  glycaemic control  in type 2  diabetes  . METHODS We search ed MEDLINE , PsychINFO , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to January , 2003 . Eligible  studies were r and omised controlled trials that involved people with type 2 diabetes and evaluated a  psychological therapy ( counselling , cognitive behaviour therapy , or psychodynamic therapy )  to improve diabetes control .  We extracted the  number of participants , their age , duration of diabetes , glycaemic control , type of  psychological therapy   , its  mode of  delivery , and type  of   intervention  in the control group . The main outcome was  long-term glycaemic control measured  by  percentage of glycated haemoglobin . Blood glucose concentration , weight , and psychological distress  were also measured . Pooled st and ardised effect sizes were calculated . FINDINGS  25 trials were eligible  for the review . In 12 trials , the  mean percentage glycated haemoglobin  was lower in people assigned a  psychological intervention  than in the  control  group  ( usual care , education , waiting list , or attention control ) ;  the pooled mean difference was -0.32 ( 95 % CI -0.57 to -0.07 ) equivalent to an absolute difference of -0.76 % . There were non-significant differences in  blood glucose concentration  ( eight trials ; -0.11 [ -0.65 to 0.42 ] ) and  weight gain  ( nine trials ; 0.37 [ -0.18 to 0.93 ] ) .  Psychological distress  was significantly lower in the intervention groups ( five trials ; -0.58 [ -0.95 to -0.20 ] ) . INTERPRETATION In type 2 diabetes , there are improvements in  long-term glycaemic control and psychological distress  but not in  weight control or blood glucose concentration  in people who receive psychological therapies."

" Specific LBP ,  higher disability levels  ,  older age  ,  female gender  ,  more social dysfunction and more social isolation , heavier work  , and  receiving higher compensation  were identified as predictors for a  longer duration of sick leave .  A history of  LBP , job satisfaction , educational level , marital status , number of dependants , smoking , working more than 8 hour shifts , occupation , and size of industry or company  do not influence  duration of sick leave  due to LBP . Many different constructs were measured to identify psychosocial predictors of  long term sick leave  , which made it impossible to determine the role of these factors."
" There is limited evidence in the literature regarding  occupational outcomes  following  bariatric surgery  , and further studies are required before firm conclusions can be drawn . However , the existing evidence does suggest that  bariatric surgery  has a generally positive impact on  occupational outcomes  . This suggests that surgery may have wider economic , social and psychological benefits above and beyond its immediate health benefits."
"sCementless   total knee arthroplasty ( TKA )   has had limited use in the United States , however , recent reports have demonstrated promising results , but there has been no meta- analysis to examine these outcomes in the past 5 years . In this review ,  37 studies ( 2,940 patients and 3,568 TKAs ) were identified and used  , comparing  cementless to cemented TKA .   Pooled implant survivorship  was compared using a fixed-effect meta- analysis between  cementless and cemented TKA  , and between  cementless TKA with and without screw fixation . Cementless TKA  had  implant survivorship  comparable to cemented TKA ( odds ratio , 1.1 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.62 - 2.00 ) . The  mean survivorship  at 10 years for  cementless TKA  was 95.6 % compared with 95.3 % for cemented TKA . At 20-year follow-up  , implant survivorship  decreased to 76 and 71 % , respectively .  No difference  was  observed between fixation with or without screws  ( OR , 1.1 ; 95 % CI , 0.16 - 7.5 ) .  Implant survivorship  for  cementless TKA  was comparable to the current gold st and ard cemented TKAs."
"ISupplemental digital content is available in the text . BACKGROUND Ileus is a common challenge in  adult surgical patients  with estimated incidence to be 17 % to 80 % . The main mechanisms of the postoperative ileus pathophysiology are fluid overload , exogenous opioids , neurohormonal dysfunction , gastrointestinal stretch , and inflammation . Management includes addressing the underlying cause and supportive care . Multiple medical interventions have been proposed , but effectiveness is uncertain . A working group of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma aim ed to evaluate the effectiveness of  metoclopramide , erythromycin , and early enteral nutrition ( EEN )  on ileus in  adult surgical patients  and to develop recommendations applicable in a daily clinical practice . METHODS Literature search identified  45 articles appropriate for inclusion .  The  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation methodology  was applied to evaluate the effect of  metoclopramide , erythromycin , and EEN  on the  resolution of ileus  in  adult surgical patients  based on selected outcomes :  return of normal bowel function , attainment of enteral feeding goal , and hospital length of stay .  The recommendations were made based on the results of a systematic review , a meta- analysis , and evaluation of levels of evidence . RESULTS The level of evidence for all  PICOs  was assessed as low . Neither metoclopramide nor erythromycin were effective in expediting the  resolution of ileus .  Analyses of 32 r and omized controlled trials showed that  EEN  facilitates  return of normal bowel function , achieving enteral nutrition goals , and reducing hospital length of stay .   In  patients who have undergone abdominal surgery  , we strongly recommend  EEN  to expedite  resolution of Ileus  , but we can not recommend for or against the use of either metoclopramide or erythromycin to hasten the  resolution of ileus  in these patients . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Type of Study Therapeutic , level II."
"nThe  combination of bariatric surgery and physical exercise  has been suggested as a promising strategy to  positively influence obesity  , not only  body weight  but also all associated  comorbidities  . An electronic search of intervention studies was carried out in which an  exercise training program  was implemented after  bariatric surgery .  The quality of each study was assessed and the data were meta-analyzed using a r and om effect model .  Twenty-six articles were included in the systematic review and 16 in the meta- analysis .  As the main conclusion ,   exercise  in patients who have undergone  bariatric surgery   does not seem to  be effective in enhancing weight loss  ( SMD = 0.15 ; 95 % CI = − 0.02 , 0.32 ; p = 0.094 ) . However , the variability in the protocol s used makes it too early to reach a definite conclusion."
"sThe risk of stroke in  atrial fibrillation ( AF )  needs to be assessed in each patient to determine the  clinical  and  cost-effectiveness  of  thromboprophylaxis  , with the aim of appropriate use of  antithrombotic therapy .  To achieve this , stroke risk factors in  AF population  s need to be identified and stroke risk stratification models have been devised on the basis of these risk factors . In this article , we firstly provide a systematic review of studies examining the attributable stroke risk of various clinical , demographic and echocardiographic patient characteristics  in AF population s.  Secondly , we performed a systematic review of published stroke risk stratification models , in terms of the results of the review of stroke risk factors and their ability to accurately discriminate between different levels of stroke risk . Thirdly , we review the health economic evidence relating to the cost-effectiveness of  anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy as thromboprophylaxis  in AF patients . The studies included in the systematic review of stroke risk factors identified history of  stroke  or  TIA  , increasing age , hypertension and structural heart disease ( left-ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophy ) to be good predictors of stroke risk in  AF patients .  The evidence regarding  diabetes  mellitus , gender and other patient characteristics was less consistent . Three stroke risk stratification models were identified that were able to discriminate between different categories  of stroke risk  to at least 95 % accuracy . Few models had addressed the cumulative nature of risk factors where a combination of risk factors would confer a greater risk than either factor alone . In patients at high risk of stroke , anticoagulation is  cost effective  , but not for those with a low risk of stroke . With the evidence available for stroke risk factors and the various alternative stroke risk stratification models , a review of these models in terms of the evidence on which they are devised and their performance in representative AF  population  s is important . The appropriate administration of  thromboprophylaxis  in AF patients would need to balance the risks and benefits of  antithrombotic therapy  with its cost-effectiveness."
"AAbstract  Postoperative dislocation  is a challenging complication after   total hip arthroplasty  (  THA  )  that affects patient outcome worldwide . Instability is one of the main complications with rates exceeding 20 % in some series . Currently , alternative acetabular components are available with  dual mobility  (  DMTHA  ) bearing surfaces and larger femoral head size that may reduce the risk of dislocation , yet provide the functional benefit of  st and ard single mobility ( STHA ) bearing surface THA .  However , whether  STHA , big femoral head ( BTHA ) and DMTHA  should be used is still controversial . This systematic review and meta- analysis aim to compare  postoperative dislocation and revision ( aseptic loosening and infection )  of BTHA , STHA and  DMTHA  in  primary or revision THA .  These clinical outcomes consist of  postoperative dislocation and revision ( aseptic loosening and infection ) .  This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines . Relevant studies were identified from Medline and Scopus from inception to June 8 , 2017 , that reported  postoperative dislocation and revision ( aseptic  loosening  and  infection  )  of either implant THA .  Eleven of 677 studies ( nine comparative studies and two RCTs ) ( N = 4084 patients ) were eligible ; all 11 studies were included in pooling .  Intervention included   dual mobility THA  ( N = 1068 patients ) ,  st and ard THA  ( N = 2568 patients ) ,  big head THA  ( N = 378 patients ) and  constrain THA  ( N = 70 patients ) .  A network meta- analysis showed  that risk of revision and dislocation of DMTHA  was significantly lower with RR of 2.19 ( 1.36 , 3.53 ) and 4.19 ( 2.04 , 8.62 ) when compared to STHA . While there was no statistically significant risk of  having revision and dislocation of DMTHA  when compared to BTHA and CTHA .  The SUCRA probability  of DM and BTHA was in the first and second rank with 46.5 and 44.8 % in the  risk of revision  and 46.7 and 45.1 % in  the risk of dislocations  . In short-term outcomes ( 5 years or less , with follow-up of 0–5 years ) , the best implant of choice that has lowest  risk of revision and dislocation  after THA is  DMTHA  follow by BTHA . We recommend using  dual mobility and big head  as an implant for safety in THA . However , there were only two studies that reported long-term survivorship ( more than 5 years , with follow-up of 5–15 years ) . Further research that assesses long-term  survivorship  is necessary to further evaluate which implants are the best for THA."

" AND RELEVANCE Current evidence suggests that , when compared with  nonsurgical treatments , bariatric surgical procedures  in  patients with a BMI of 30 to 35 and diabetes  are associated with  greater short-term weight loss and better intermediate glucose outcomes  . Evidence is insufficient to reach conclusions about the appropriate use  of bariatric surgery  in this population until more data are available about long-term outcomes and complications of surgery."

Further research is needed before firm recommendations can be made concerning the supplementation of vitamin B12 and folate.
"dProtein energy malnutrition is a common problem in  patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) .  Scattered reports indicate that  supplementation of Carnitine  may improve patients ' clinical symptoms , with significant improvement in nutritional parameters . This systematic review was done to document the evidence s of Carnitine effects in nutritional status of  CKD patients .  Peer- review ed RCTs on  Carnitine administration  at any dose in  CKD patients with at least four weeks of follow-up  were including in the meta- analysis . Online data bases ( PubMed / Medline , ISI Web of Science , Embase , and Scopus ) were search ed to October 2017 using selected MeSH terms related to the study topic . Data was extracted independently by two review ers using a st and ard form and then cross-checked . Statistical analyses were carried out with Comprehensive Meta- analysis software . Data are presented as st and ard mean difference ( SMD ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . According to the predefined criteria ,  a total of 14 r and omized controlled clinical trials  were included and screened for data extraction by two review ers , separately . The preliminary results extracted from meta- analysis have shown that Carnitine can significantly increase the  levels of albumin  ( SMD : -0.861 ; 95 % CI : -1.321 , -0.402 ) ,  total protein  ( SMD : -0.418 ; 95 % CI : -0.695 , -0.141 ) ,  total cholesterol  ( SMD : -0.350 ; 95 % CI : -0.564 , -0.135 ) ,  LDL cholesterol  ( SMD : -0.362 ; 95 % CI : -0.551 , -0.173 ) ,  transferrin  ( SMD : -1.465 ; 95 % CI : -1.822 , -1.108 ) , and  hemoglobin  ( SMD : -0.525 ; 95 % CI : -0.732 , -0.318 ) ; however there were no conclusive effects of Carnitine on  body weight  ( SMD : -0.057 ; 95 % CI : -0.404 , 0.291 ) and  BMI  ( SMD : -0.567 ; 95 % CI : -1.548 , 0.415 ) , in pooled analyses . The results of this meta- analysis showed that there are considerable useful pieces of evidence so far about the effect of Carnitine on nutritional factors ; however , there is still doubt about some evidence s with this regard . It seems necessary to carry out clinical trials with stronger design s to evaluate the impact of these primary outcomes on the patients ' clinical conditions . Having this evidence s , the potential role of Carnitine in improving malnutrition consequences in  CKD patients  would be clearly defined."
"sIntroduction  Psychotropic medication  use is associated with   weight gain .   While there are studies and review s comparing  weight gain  for  psychotropics  within some classes , clinicians frequently use drugs from different classes to treat psychiatric disorders  .  Objective To undertake a systematic review of all classes of  psychotropics  to provide an all encompassing evidence -based tool that would allow clinicians to determine the risks of  weight gain  in making both intra-class and interclass choices of  psychotropics .  Methodology and Results We developed a novel hierarchical search strategy that made use of systematic review s that were already available . When such evidence was not available we went on to evaluate r and omly controlled trials , followed by cohort and other clinical trials , narrative review s , and , where necessary , clinical opinion and anecdotal evidence . The data from the publication with the highest level of evidence based on our hierarchical classification was presented . Recommendations from an expert panel supplemented the evidence used to rank these drugs within their respective classes .  Approximately 9500 articles were identified in our literature search of which 666 citations were retrieved .  We were able to rank most of the psychotropics based on the available evidence and recommendations from subject matter experts . There were few discrepancies between published evidence and the expert panel in ranking these drugs . Conclusion  Potential  for  weight gain  is an important consideration in choice of any psychotropic . This tool will help clinicians select  psychotropics  on a case-by-case basis in order to minimize the impact of  weight gain  when making both intra-class and interclass choices."
"eAims : The aim of this meta‐ analysis of r and omized placebo‐controlled clinical trials was to assess the effect of  fibrates  on  glycemic parameters  . Material s and methods :  Only r and omized  placebo‐controlled  trials  investigating the impact of   fibrate  treatment  on   glucose  homeostasis  markers were search ed in PubMed ‐ Medline , SCOPUS , Web of Science and Google Scholar data bases ( from inception to April 11 , 2017 ) . A r and om‐effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis . Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave‐one‐out method . A weighted r and om‐effects meta‐regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounders on  glycemic parameters  . Results : This meta‐ analysis of data from  22 r and omized placebo‐controlled clinical trials involving a total of 11,402 subjects  showed  that fibrate therapy  significantly  decreased fasting plasma glucose  ( WMD : −0.28 mmol/L , 95 % CI : −0.42 , −0.14 , p <  0.001 ) ,  insulin  levels  ( WMD : −3.87 pmol/L , 95 % CI : −4.97 , −2.78 , p < 0.001  ) and insulin resistance  ( HOMA‐IR , WMD : −1.09 , 95 % CI : −1.71 , −0.47 , p = 0.001 ) , but with no effect  on  HbA1c ( WMD : 0.01 % , 95 % CI : −0.18 , 0.19 , p = 0.955 ) . All analyses were robust in the leave‐one‐out sensitivity analysis except for insulin levels that showed a non‐significant result ( WMD : −0.84 pmol/L , 95 % CI : −6.36 , 4.68 , p = 0.766 ) following omission of one of the included trials . Conclusion : This meta‐ analysis has shown  that  fibrate  treatment   significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose , insulin levels , and HOMA‐IR  indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits .

"PSTUDY DESIGN systematic review and meta- analysis . OBJECTIVE to assess how confidently   low back pain  ( LBP )  can be attributed to abnormalities on  magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )  , and thereby explore the potential value of MRI abnormalities in refining case definition for mechanical LBP in epidemiological research . SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA most epidemiological studies of mechanical LBP have defined cases only by reported symptoms , but it is possible that the potency of causes differs depending on whether there is demonstrable underlying spinal pathology . METHODS we review ed the published data on MRI abnormalities , looking for data on the repeatability of their assessment , their prevalence in  people free from LBP  , and  their association with LBP .  Where data were sufficient , we calculated a summary estimate of prevalence in  people without LBP  and a meta-estimate of the odds ratio for the association with LBP . A formula was then applied to estimate the corresponding  prevalence  rate ratio , assuming 3 possible prevalence rates for LBP in the general population . RESULTS data were most extensive for disc protrusion , nerve root displacement or compression , disc degeneration , and high intensity zone , all of which could be assessed repeatedly . All were associated with LBP , meta-estimates of  odds ratios  ranging from 2.3 ( nerve root displacement or compression ) to 3.6 ( disc protrusion ) . However , even for disc protrusion , estimates of the corresponding  prevalence rate ratios  were mostly less than 2 .  MRI findings of disc protrusion , nerve root displacement or compression , disc degeneration , and high intensity zone are all associated with LBP , but individually , none of these abnormalities provides a strong indication that LBP is attributable to underlying pathology . This limits their value in refining epidemiological case definitions for LBP."

"sResearch on the  quality of life ( QL )  of  children/adolescents with psychological disorders  has flourished over the last few decades . Given the developmental challenges of QL measurements in pediatric population s , the aim of this study was to ascertain the extent to which a  developmental  approach to   QL  assessment  has been applied to pedopsychiatric QL research . A systematic literature search was conducted in three electronic data bases ( PubMed , PsycINFO , SocINDEX ) from 1994 to May 2014 . Quantitative studies were included if they assessed the   self- or proxy-reported QL   of  children/adolescents with a psychological disorder .  Data were extracted for study design , participants , QL instruments and informants , and statistical approach to age-related specificities . The systematic review revealed widespread utilization of developmentally  appropriate QL instruments  but less frequent use of both self and proxy reports and an inconsistent approach to age group specificities . Method ological guidelines are discussed to improve the developmental validity of QL research for children/adolescents with mental disorders."
"sAdults  with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , especially teenagers and young adults  , show important car driving impairments , including risky driving , accidents , fines and suspension of driver׳s license . We systematic ally review ed the efficacy of  stimulant and non-stimulant drugs  on  driving performance  of  ADHD patients .  We search ed several data bases for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) published through March , 2013 . Fifteen RCTs ( the majority with crossover design ) evaluated  methylpheni date ( MPH ) immediate-release ( MPH-IR ) , MPH osmotic-controlled oral system ( MPH-OROS ) , MPH transdermal system ( MTS ) , extended-release mixed amphetamine salts ( MAS-XR ) ; atomoxetine ( ATX ) and lisdexamfetamine ( LDX ) .  Methods varied widely ; including simulators and /or cars and different courses and scenarios . Various outcomes of  driving performance  , including a  ' composite ' or ' overall ' driving score  were considered . In general , stimulants  improved driving performance  in ADHD patients ( either in RCTs conducted in simulators and /or cars ) .  MPH-OROS   improved driving performance  compared with  MAS-XR  , placebo , or no-drug conditions . Although  MPH-OROS  and  MPH-IR  produced similar improvements during the day , MPH-IR lost  its efficacy  in the evening .  MAS-XR  also  improved driving performance  ,  but worsened driving performance  in the evening . MTS ( one study ) showed a positive effect , but  drug  compliance varied widely across patients . LDX had positive  effect on driving  ( two studies with the same sample ) . Studies with ATX report conflicting results . Improvement was more consistent in teenagers and young adults . In general , treatment with  psychostimulants  or  ATX  in therapeutic dosages had no  negative impact on driving performance  of ADHD patients . To conclude , treatment  with  stimulants in therapeutic doses  improves driving performance  in ADHD patients , especially teenagers and young adults."
" : Although widely used , there is little evaluative research on the preventive measures studied here . The review showed that there is limited evidence that  exercise  has some effect in the prevention of back pain and that education is not effective . No conclusive evidence was found for or against the effectiveness of lumbar supports . Research of higher method ological quality is needed before firm conclusions on the effectiveness of  lumbar supports , education , and exercise  in the  prevention of back pain in industry  can be drawn."
"aCa digestibility and utilisation in  growing pigs  are not well understood , and are usually neglected in diet formulation . This has implication s not only for the accurate determination of its requirements but also for its interactions with other nutrients . A systematic review and meta- analysis ( meta-regression ) of published trials was carried out to quantify factors affecting Ca absorption and utilisation , and to derive an estimate of Ca  endogenous  excretion . The analysis was carried out on the data from  forty studies , corresponding to 201 treatments performed on 1204 pigs .  The results indicated that  although Ca absorption and retention  ( g/kg of body weight per d ) increased with  increasing Ca  intake ( P<0·001  ) , non-phytate-P  intake ( P<0·001  ) and exogenous phytase  supplementation ( P<0·001 ) , these values decreased with  increasing phytate-P  intake ( P<0·05 ) . Interactions between exogenous phytase and Ca intake , indicating reduced efficacy of this enzyme ( P<0·001 ) , and between phytate-P intake and exogenous phytase , counteracting the direct negative effect of phytate-P ( P<0·05 )  on Ca absorption and retention  , were also detected . There were no effects of animal-related characteristics , such as pig genotype  in Ca absorption and retention  . The large amount of variance explained  in Ca absorption  ( 90 % )  and retention  ( 91 % ) supported our choice of independent  variables . Endogenous Ca losses  obtained via linear regression were 239 mg/kg of DM intake ( 95 % CI 114 , 364 ) . These outcomes advance the current underst and ing of Ca digestibility and utilisation , and should contribute towards establishing requirements for digestible Ca . Consequently , pig diets will be more correctly formulated if digestible Ca values are used in estimating requirements for Ca."
"eRecommendations for zinc intake during pregnancy and lactation vary widely across  Europe .  Using data on zinc intake and biomarkers of zinc status reported in r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and observational studies can provide estimates of dose-response relationships that may be used for underpinning zinc reference values . This systematic review included  all RCTs , prospect i ve cohort studies , nested case-control studies and cross-sectional studies in healthy pregnant and lactating population s published by February 2010  which  provided data on  zinc  intake and  biomarkers  of zinc status  . An intake-status regression coefficient ( βˆ ) was calculated for each individual study and calculated the overall pooled βˆ and SE ( βˆ ) using r and om effects meta- analysis on a double log scale . The pooled dose-response relationship between zinc intake and zinc status found that a doubling of zinc intake was associated with an increase in  serum/plasma zinc status  by 3 % in pregnant women and by 1 % in lactating women . These modest associations are likely to reflect the low-moderate zinc bioavailability dietary patterns and the widespread use of other micronutrients in the population s included in this review , physiologic adjustments of zinc homeostasis , insensitivity of  serum/plasma zinc  as a biomarker of zinc status , and wide heterogeneity between study results which reflect real uncertainty in the current evidence base . Although this review provides useful information for dietary zinc requirements in population s vulnerable to zinc deficiency , it also highlights a need for further studies in  pregnant and lactating women with different dietary patterns  in order to provide useful complementary evidence that can be utilized when setting zinc recommendations as a basis for nutrition policies in Europe."
"eBackground Metabolic syndrome is the most important risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes . The aim of this review was to systematic ally assess and perform a meta- analysis of the effects of  yoga  on the parameters of metabolic syndrome . Methods MEDLINE / PubMed , Scopus , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and IndMED were search ed and screened from their inception through to 8 March 2016 for r and omised controlled trials on  yoga   for patients with metabolic syndrome .  Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool . Results  Seven trials with a total of 794 participants were included .  No effects of  yoga   on resolution of metabolic syndrome , diastolic blood pressure , triglycerides , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose  were found , but  yoga  was superior to usual care  for waist circumference  ( st and ardised mean difference ( SMD ) = −0.35 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = −0.57 to −0.13 ; p <  0.01 ) and systolic blood pressure  ( SMD = −0.29 ; 95 % CI = −0.51 to −0.07 ; p = 0.01 ) . However , these effects were not robust against selection bias . No intervention-related  adverse  events were reported . Conclusion Based on the results of this meta- analysis , no recommendation can be made for or against  yoga  in order to influence  the  parameters of  metabolic  syndrome . Despite method ological drawbacks , and until further research is undertaken ,  yoga  can be preliminarily considered as a  safe and effective  intervention for  reducing waist circumference and systolic blood pressure  in individuals with metabolic syndrome who are not adhering to conventional forms of exercise."

An electronic search was conducted in EMBASE , LILACS , PubMed , SciELO , Scopus and Web of Knowledge using both free-text keywords and controlled vocabulary . Additional studies were sought through h and search ing of endodontic journals and of the relevant chapters of endodontic textbooks . No language restriction was imposed . The retrieved studies were screened by two review ers according to predefined criteria . Included studies were critically appraised and the extracted data were arranged in tables . The electronic search and h and search retrieved  489 titles . One clinical study and 14 in vitro studies were finally included in the review  ; none of these studies assessed treatment outcome , four studies assessed the  antimicrobial effect  , seven studies evaluated the  removal of pulp tissue remnants  , and four studies investigated the  removal of hard tissue debris  or  both hard tissue debris and pulp tissue remnants .  Poor st and ardization and description of the protocol s was evident . Inconclusive results were reported about the  cleaning and disinfection  accomplished by the two irrigation methods .  Negative pressure irrigation  was more  effective  under certain conditions when compared to  suboptimal syringe irrigation ;  however , the variability of the protocol s hindered quantitative synthesis . There is insufficient evidence to cl aim general superiority of any one of these methods . The level of the available evidence is low , and the conclusions should be interpreted with caution."

"nBACKGROUND Early onset of menopause is associated with long-term health risks , including  cardiovascular disease and premature death .  Although alcohol intake has been suggested to affect the age at which natural menopause occurs , results from observational studies are not consistent . OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE In the view of the differing risks to the health of early menopause and the increasing  trends in alcohol consumption in women  , in this systematic review , we aim ed to quantify the association between all levels of alcohol consumption and  menopause onset .  SEARCH METHODS  Six electronic data bases ( Medline , Embase , Cochrane , PubMed , Google Scholar and Web of Science ) were systematic ally search ed until 4 November 2015  to identify relevant studies assessing the  association between alcohol consumption and  onset of menopause  .  Two independent review ers screened the titles and abstract s of all initially identified studies according to the selection criteria . Studies were sought if they ( i ) were observational cross-sectional , prospect i ve and interventional studies , ( ii ) had reported on natural onset of menopause , ( iii ) had reported on alcohol consumption , ( iv ) had assessed the association between alcohol consumption and  menopause  onset , ( v ) were conducted in  humans  and ( vi ) were not conducted in  patients with  cancer . Data were extracted by two independent review ers using a pre design ed data - collection form . The primary exposure variable was the presence of active  alcohol  drinking at baseline compared with a  reference  group of non-drinkers .  Pooled relative risks ( RRs )  were calculated . OUTCOMES Of the  1193 references  ( all in  English language )  review ed for eligibility ,  22 articles  based on  20 unique studies were  included in the final analysis . A  total of 41 339 and 63 868 non-overlapping women were included  in the meta- analysis of cross-sectional and observational cohort studies , respectively . In cross-sectional studies , the pooled RR for  earlier onset of menopause  was 0.86 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.78 - 0.96 ) between drinkers versus non-drinkers . Analysis of the levels of alcohol consumed showed that low and moderate alcohol consumption ( more than one drink per week ( RR = 0.60 ; 95 % CI : 0.49 - 0.75 ) and three or fewer drinks per week ( RR = 0.75 ; 95 % CI : 0.60 - 0.94 ) ) were associated with  later menopause onset  , compared to non-drinkers . In prospect i ve studies , RR for  earlier menopause onset  was 0.95 ( 95 % CI : 0.91 - 0.98 ) when comparing  women who reported  drinking  alcohol  versus  women who  did not . Analysis of the dose of alcohol consumed showed that  low-to-moderate alcohol  intake ( 0 - 8 g/day ( RR = 0.95 ; 95 % CI : 0.93 - 0.98 ) , and 16 g/day ( RR = 0.89 , 95%CI : 0.86 - 0.92 ) ) was associated with  later menopause onset  , compared to non-drinking . WIDER IMPLICATION S The findings of this review indicate that alcohol consumption , particularly low and moderate alcohol intake , might be associated with  later onset of menopause  although the magnitude of the association is low . Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings , clarify the level of alcohol intake at which menopause is delayed and identify the potential mechanisms behind this association."

"tThis systematic review aims to evaluate r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating the effect of  vitamin D supplementation  on   endothelial function  and  inflammation  in adults .  An electronic search of published r and omised controlled trials , using Cochrane , Pubmed and Medline data bases was conducted , with the search terms related to vitamin D and endothelial function . Inclusion criteria were  RCTs in adult humans with a measure of  vitamin D  status using serum/plasma   25(OH)D  and  studies  which administered the intervention  through the oral route .  Among  the 1107 studies retrieved , 29 studies met  the full inclusion  criteria  for this systematic review . Overall , 8 studies reported significant improvements in the  endothelial/inflammatory biomarkers/parameters  measured . However , in 2 out of the 8 studies , improvements were reported at interim time points , but improvements were absent post-intervention . The remaining 21 trial studies did not show significant improvements in the  markers of interest  measured . Evidence from the studies included in this systematic review did not demonstrate that  vitamin  D  supplementation in adults  , results in an  improvement in circulating inflammatory and endothelial function biomarkers/parameters .  This systematic review does not therefore support the use of  vitamin D  supplementation as a therapeutic or preventative measure for CVD in this respect."
"  Systematic  and  opportunistic screening  for AF  increase the rate of detection of new cases  compared with routine practice . While both approaches have a comparable effect on  the overall AF diagnosis rate  , the cost of  systematic screening  is significantly more than that of  opportunistic screening  from the perspective of the health service provider . The lack of studies investigating the effect of screening in other health systems and younger age groups means that caution needs to be exercised in relation to the transferability of these results beyond the setting and population in which the included study was conducted . Additional research is needed to examine the effectiveness of alternative screening strategies and to investigate the effect of the intervention on the risk of stroke for screened versus non-screened population."

"sAbstract Background Several studies have compared  robotics‐assisted ( RA ) and conventional manual ( CM ) approaches  for  total hip arthroplasty ( THA )  , but their results are controversial . Methods A literature search was conducted for controlled clinical trials ( CCTs ) comparing the clinical efficacy of the  RA and CM approaches  for  THA and published between August  1998  and August 2018  . The obtained data were analyzed using the statistical software Review Manager 5.3 . Results  Fourteen articles were included in the meta‐ analysis  , which revealed that the  RA  group had  less intraoperative complications  ,  better cup angle  , and more  cases of cup placement  in the safe zone than the  CM  group . However ,  the operation time  required for the  CM  group was less than that required for the  RA  group . Moreover  , postoperative complications ( eg , dislocation and revision surgery )  were less frequent in the  CM  group than in the RA group . However , the two groups had  similar functional scores , total number of complications , and rate of occurrence of limb length discrepancy  . Conclusion Compared with  the CM  approach ,  the RA  approach yields better  radiological outcomes  and  fewer intraoperative complications  in THA , but similar functional scores."

"sBACKGROUND & AIMS  Micronutrients  are essential for brain development with deficiencies in specific nutrients linked to impaired cognitive function . Interventions are shown to be beneficial to children 's mental development , particularly in  subjects who were micronutrient-deficient at baseline but results on healthy subjects  remain inconsistent . This systematic review evaluated the effect of  micronutrient inventions  on different cognitive domains . Studies conducted in both developing and developed countries , and trials that investigate the effect of both  single and multiple micronutrient intervention  were review ed . METHODS Systematic search es of Medline , CINAHL Plus and Academic Search data base were undertaken to identify trials published after year 2000 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that evaluate the effect of  micronutrients  on  cognitive performance   or  academic performance  among children aged 4 - 18 years were  included . RESULTS  19 trials  were identified from  18 articles .  The major cognitive outcomes assessed included  fluid intelligence , crystallized intelligence , short-term memory , long-term memory , cognitive processing speed , attention and concentration , and school performance .  Eight of ten trials assessing  fluid intelligence  reported significant positive effects of  micronutrient supplementation  among micronutrient-deficient children , especially those who were iron-deficient or iodine-deficient at baseline . The effects of  micronutrient interventions  on other domains were inconsistent .  Improvement in  fluid intelligence  among  micronutrient-deficient children  was consistently reported . Further research is needed to provide more definite evidence on the beneficial effects of  micronutrient inventions  on other cognitive domains and the effects in healthy subjects."

"sTo summarise evidence about the effectiveness of  home  blood pressure telemonitoring ( HBPT )   and identify the key components of intervention . We comprehensively search ed PubMed , EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies . The authors were contacted for additional information . Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias .  46 r and omised controlled trials including a total of 13 875 cases were identified .  Compared with usual care  , HBPT   improved office systolic blood pressure ( BP ) and diastolic BP  by 3.99 mm Hg ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 5.06–2.93 ; P<0.001 ) and 1.99 mm Hg ( 95 % CI : −2.60 to −1.39 ; P<0.001 ) , respectively . A larger proportion of patients  achieved BP normalisation  in the intervention group ( relative risk ( RR ) : 1.16 ; 95 % CI : 1.08–1.25 ; P<0.001 ) .  For HBPT plus additional support ( including counselling , education , behavioural management , medication management with decision , adherence contracts and so on ) versus HBPT alone ( or plus less intense additional support  )   ,  the mean changes in systolic and diastolic BP  were 2.44 mm Hg ( 95 % Cl , 4.88 to 0.00 mm Hg ; P=0.05 ) and 1.12 mm Hg ( 95 % CI , −2.34 to 0.1 mm Hg ; P=0.07 ) , respectively . For those surrogate outcomes , low-strength evidence failed to show difference . In subgroup analysis , high strength evidence supported a  lower  BP  with HBPT  that lasted for 6 or 12 months and was accompanied with counselling support from study personnel .  HBPT  can  improve BP control  in  the hypertensive patients .  It may be more efficacious when a proactive additional support is provided during the intervention process."

We search ed PubMed , EMbase , The Cochrane Library , and the Clinical trial.gov data bases for relevant studies published between January  1980 and September 2015  . Two independent review ers extracted relevant data and assessed study quality and risk of bias . Data were pooled using a r and om-effects model for leptin and a fixed-effects model for adiponectin . Effect of size was expressed as mean difference ( MD ) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Heterogeneity was assessed ( Cochran Q-statistic ) and quantified ( I 2 ) .  Twenty-eight RCTs ( 40 studies ) were identified  , of which 24 were on the effects of   exercise   on  leptin  ( n=1 358 ) and 31 referred to changes in  adiponectin  ( n=1 774 ) . Our analysis revealed  that exercise  significantly  reduced serum leptin  ( MD=-2.24 ng/ml ; 95 % CI , -3.26 , -1.23 ; p<0.001 ) and  increased adiponectin  ( MD=0.44 μg/ml ; 95 % CI , 0.13 , 0.75 ; p=0.005 ) levels  compared to no exercise  as well as control ( who were also overweight or obese  ) . Exercise , particularly aerobic exercise  , had a significant effect on  serum leptin  and a possible influence on  adiponectin levels  , suggesting its therapeutic implication."

" After 18 - 24 months ,  formocresol , ferric sulfate  ,  and MTA  showed  significantly better clinical and radiographic outcomes  than  calcium hydroxide  and  laser therapies  in primary molar pulpotomies . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The network meta-analyses showed that MTA is the first choice for primary molar pulpotomies . However , if  treatment  cost is an issue , especially when the treated primary molars are going to be replaced by permanent teeth , ferric sulfate may be the choice."
"yBackground  Pregnant women and newborns  are at risk for  vitamin D  deficiency ( VDD ) . Also , poor health outcomes for  pregnant women  with VDD are reported in the published literature . Objective The aim of this systematic review was to estimate the prevalence of  hypovitaminosis D  and the associated risk factors for   hypovitaminosis D  in Middle Eastern pregnant women and their newborns .  Results The prevalence of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin   D  (  25(OH)D  )  < 50 nmol/L as a marker of vitamin D status in pregnant women and their newborns was between 24.5 - 98 % and 22 - 100 % , respectively . The prevalence of  25(OH ) D < 25 nmol/L  in pregnant women and their newborns was over a wide range between 16.7 - 80 % and 22 - 82 % , respectively . Predictors for  low maternal and neonatal 25(OH)D concentrations  included  decreased vitamin D synthesis  due to reduced exposure to sunlight and decreased nutritional intake of vitamin D. A predictor of  low neonatal 25(OH)D concentrations  included  maternal vitamin D status  and the correlation  between vitamin D concentrations  in maternal  and cord blood  . Conclusion The high prevalence of VDD in the  pregnant women of the Middle East  underscores the necessity of implementing national prevention and intervention strategies . A clear policy for clinicians and healthcare workers is needed for screening and maintaining sufficient vitamin  D  status during pregnancy."
"gToxicities of systemic cancer therapies are often less frequently observed in clinical trials than in clinical practice , due to the careful selection of  patients with fewer comorbidities .  Although guidelines exist for the estimation of chemotherapy dose , clinical factors like age , comorbid illness and extremes of body habitus are not considered in the method of dose calculation , which can result in significant toxicity . We review ed the referenced clinical trials from which the  evidence -based  curative-intent cancer treatment protocol   s were developed for EVIQ , which is an Australian government , online re source . This review shows that a significant proportion of  patients in curative-intent clinical trials  experience  toxicities  that result in dose modifications-dose reduction , dose delays or missed doses-despite strict selection criteria and intense monitoring . Thus , even in ideal , clinical -trial setting s  chemotherapy  dose calculation remains imprecise and subject to adjustment as clinical ly appropriate . In real-world clinical practice , dose alterations or modifications in response to  toxicities  need to be thoroughly discussed and implemented with clear underst and ing of the patient with appropriate documentation . This review may be used as a reference in these situations to elaborate the extent of  toxicities  seen in clinical trials with optimal setting."

"0Review question / objective What is the effectiveness of  polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA )  in reducing the clinical symptoms of  paediatric bipolar disorder ( PBD ) in children and adolescents  ? The objectives of this systematic review are to : • Evaluate the effectiveness of different types of  PUFA  in reducing the clinical symptoms of PBD . • Evaluate the effectiveness of  PUFA supplementation  as either monotherapy or as adjuvant treatment to reduce clinical symptoms of PBD . Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include a focus on  children and adolescents ( aged 6 - 18 y ) with diagnosis of all types of PBD based on DSM-IV criteria ( BD I , BD II and BD NOS ) , who have had an episode of mania , hypomania or mixed mania .  Studies that include any other population group or any other mental health condition except PBD will be excluded unless data relating to participants who meet this review 's inclusion criteria have been reported separately . Types of intervention(s ) This review will consider studies that evaluate the effectiveness of  PUFA supplementation  to reduce clinical symptoms of PBD or look at the correlation between low PUFA intake in diet and PBD in children and adolescents .  Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids supplementation  will include  Omega-3 supplementation ( either EPA , DHA or combination of two fatty acids ) , Omega-6 supplementation ( alpha linolenic acid , linoleic acid ) , fish-oil supplementation and flax oil .  Any types of  PUFA supplementation  as monotherapy or adjunctive to st and ard care will be included . Studies exploring the effectiveness of other dietary factors and nutrients on PBD will be excluded . Types of outcomes This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures :  change in the severity of the clinical symptoms in PBD , both  for mania and depression . In particular the primary outcomes will be  symptom severity  , to include  symptoms of mania , depression and clinical global impression of psychiatric symptoms .  These are likely to be measured with the  : • Global Assessment of Functioning Scale ( GAF ) • Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) • Brief Psychosis Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , • Children 's Depression Rating Scale ( CDRS ) • Clinical Global Impressions Scale ( CGI )  •  Hamilton  Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) TRUNCATED AT 350."
"yBackground  People with diabetes and comorbid severe mental illness ( SMI )  form a growing population at risk of increased mortality and morbidity compared to those with diabetes or SMI alone . There is increasing interest in interventions that target diabetes in SMI in order to help to  improve physical health and reduce the associated health inequalities .  However , there is a lack of consensus about which outcomes are important for this comorbid population , with trials differing in their focus on physical and mental health . A core outcome set , which includes outcomes across both conditions that are relevant to patients and other key stakeholders , is needed . Methods This study protocol describes methods to develop a core  outcome  set for use in effectiveness trials of   self-management  interventions  for  adults with comorbid type-2 diabetes and SMI .  We will use a modified Delphi method to identify , rank , and agree core outcomes . This will comprise a two-round online survey and multistakeholder workshops involving patients and carers , health and social care professionals , health care commissioners , and other experts ( e.g. academic research ers and third sector organisations ) . We will also select appropriate  measurement tools  for each outcome in the proposed core set and identify gaps in measures , where these exist . Discussion The proposed core outcome set will provide clear guidance about what outcomes should be measured , as a minimum , in trials of interventions for  people with coexisting type-2 diabetes and SMI  , and improve future synthesis of trial evidence in this area . We will also explore the challenges of using online Delphi methods for this hard-to-reach population , and examine differences in opinion about which outcomes matter to diverse stakeholder groups .

"gSelenium  supplementation  in  people with Hashimoto 's thyroiditis  might reduce antibody levels and result in a decreased dosage of  levothyroxine  ( LT4 ) and may provide other beneficial effects ( e.g. on  mood  and  health-related quality of life )  . The aim of our systematic review was to assess the effects of  selenium supplementation  on  Hashimoto 's thyroiditis .  We search ed The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , EMBASE and Web of Science for r and omized controlled trials . Study selection , data extraction , assessment of risk of bias and analyses were carried out by two independent review authors . We assessed the quality of the evidence of included studies using GRADE .  Four studies  rated at unclear to  high  risk of  bias comprising 463 participants were included .  One study at high risk of bias showed statistically significant  improvement in subjective well-being   with sodium selenite 200 μg  plus titrated  LT4  compared  with placebo  plus titrated  LT4  ( RR 4.67 , 95 % CI 1.61 -  13.50 ) . Selenomethionine  200  μg  as a single treatment or  combined with LT4   reduced the serum levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies   compared with placebo ( or placebo plus LT4 )  in three studies ( p < 0.001 ) . Although the changes from baseline were statistically significant in these three studies , their clinical relevance is unclear . In conclusion , the results of these four studies , assessed at unclear to high risk of bias , show that evidence to support or refute the  efficacy of selenium supplementation  in  people with Hashimoto 's thyroiditis  is incomplete and not reliable to help inform clinical decision making."

" Studies on  independent mobility  suggested that  children  who have the  freedom to play outdoors  and  travel actively  without adult supervision accumulate more  physical activity  than those who do not . Further investigation of  children 's  active travel to leisure-related destinations , measurement of diverse sedentary behaviour beyond simply screen-based activities , and consistent thresholds for objective ly measured sedentary behaviour in children will clarify the inconsistent evidence base on associations of  active travel  with sedentary  behaviour  and weight status."
"yThis study aim ed to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) in order to calculate the effect size of  statin therapy  in changing  plasma cortisol concentrations  . Following a systematic search in Medline , SCOPUS , Web of Science and Google Scholar data bases ( by up to March 01 , 2015 ) ,  7 eligible RCTs were selected .  R and om-effects meta- analysis suggested a significant increase in  plasma cortisol concentrations  following  statin  therapy ( WMD : 6.34 % , 95 % CI : 1.80 , 10.87 , p=0.006 ) . Subgroup analysis confirmed the significance of the effect with lipophilic  statins comprising atorvastatin , simvastatin , and lovastatin  ( WMD : 7.00 % , 95 % CI : 2.21 , 11.79 , p=0.004 ) but not with  hydrophilic statins ( rosuvastatin and pravastatin )  ( WMD : 0.60 % , 95 % CI : -13.46 , 14.66 , p=0.933 ) . In the meta-regression analysis ,  changes in plasma cortisol concentrations  following  statin therapy  were found to be independent of treatment duration . Results of this meta- analysis of RCTs suggest a significant  elevation in plasma cortisol levels  following statin therapy."
"dBackground : Smoking behaviour is a major public health problem worldwide . Several sources have confirmed the implication of genomic factors in smoking  behaviour  . These factors interact both with environmental factors and interventions to develop a certain behaviour . Objectives : Describing the  environmental and genomic factors  as well as  the interventions influencing  smoking cessation   ( SC ) and developing a working model incorporating the different factors influencing SC were our main objectives . Methods : Two systematic review s were conducted using  articles in English from the Cochrane library , PubMed and HuGENet from January 2000 to September 2012 :  ( 1 ) a systematic review of systematic review s and meta-analyses and ( 2 ) a systematic  review  of original research for  genomic factors .  The proposed working model was developed by making use of previous models of SC and applying an iterative process of discussion and re-examination by the authors . Results : We confirmed the importance of the 4 main factors influencing SC : ( 1 )  environmental factors ,  ( 2 )  genomic factors  , ( 3 )  gene-environment interactions  , and ( 4 )  evidence  -based  interventions .  The model demonstrates the complex network of factors influencing SC . Conclusion : The working model of SC proposed a global view of factors influencing SC , warranting future research in this area . Future testing of the model will consoli date the underst and ing of the different factors affecting SC and will help to improve interventions in this field."

"eIntroduction Management of   atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and atrial flutter ( AFL )   in the  emergency department ( ED )  varies greatly , and there are currently no United States guidelines to guide management with regard to patient disposition after ED treatment . The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the literature for decision aids to guide disposition of  patients with AF/AFLin the ED  , and assess potential  outcomes  associated with different management strategies in the ED . Methods and Results A systematic review was done using PubMed ( MEDLINE ) , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , and EMBASE , combining the search terms "" Atrial Fibrillation "" , "" Atrial Flutter "" , "" Emergency Medicine "" , "" Emergency Service "" , and "" Emergency Treatment "" . After removal of duplicates ,  754 articles were identified .  After initial screening of titles and abstract s , 69full text articles were carefully review ed and 34 articles were ultimately included in the study based on inclusion and exclusion criteria . The articles were grouped into four main categories :  decision aids and outcome predictors , electrical cardioversion-based protocol  s , antiarrhythmic-based protocol s , and general  management  protocol s. Conclusion This systematic review is the first study to our knowledge to evaluate the optimal management of  symptomatic  AF/AFLin   the ED with a direct impact on ED disposition . There are several viable management strategies that can result in safe discharge from the ED in the right patient population , and decision aids can be utilized to guide selection of appropriate patients for discharge."
"  Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation  is effective at reducing important clinical outcomes in  patients with coronary heart disease .  While our analysis was constrained by the quality of included trials and missing information about intervention components , there appears to be little differential effect of variations in  exercise intervention  , particularly on  mortality outcomes  . Given the observed effect between higher adherence and improved outcomes , it may be more important to provide  exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs  which focus on achieving increased adherence to the exercise intervention."
  Multifaceted professional interventions and organizational interventions  that facilitate structured and regular review of patients were  effective in improving the process of care .  The addition of  patient education  to these interventions and the enhancement of the role of  nurses in diabetes care  led to improvements in  patient outcomes  and the process of care.
"sAtrial  fibrillation ( AF )  is associated with an increased  stroke risk  that may be reduced by  therapeutic anticoagulation .  However ,  anticoagulation  is associated with an increased  risk of bleeding  that in some patients may outweigh the benefits in reducing the risk of  stroke .  We systematic ally review ed the literature for risk factors of  anticoagulation-related bleeding complications  in  patients with AF  , as part of the formulation of recently published national guidelines for the management of AF . We identified  nine studies that  reported   anticoagulation-related bleeding complications  in AF patients .  The following patient characteristics were identified as having supporting evidence for being risk factors for  anticoagulation-related bleeding complications :  advanced age , uncontrolled hypertension , history of myocardial infa rct ion or ischaemic heart disease , cerebrovascular disease , anaemia or a history of bleeding , and the concomitant use of other drugs such as antiplatelet agents . The presence of diabetes mellitus , controlled hypertension and gender were not identified as significant risk factors . Some of the risk factors for  anticoagulation-related bleeding  are also indications for the use of  anticoagulants  in AF patients  .  There is a need for further research in this area to help physicians to balance the risks and benefits of anticoagulation in AF patients."
"gNon-specific  low back pain ( LBP )  affects many people and has major socio-economic consequences . Traditional therapeutic strategies , mainly focused on biomechanical factors , have had moderate and short-term impact . Certain psychosocial factors have been linked to poor prognosis of LBP and they are increasingly considered as promising targets for management of LBP . Primary health care providers ( HCPs ) are involved in most of the management of  people with LBP  and they are skilled in providing comprehensive care , including consideration of psychosocial dimensions . This review aims to discuss three pieces of recent research focusing on  psychosocial issues  in  LBP patients in primary care .  In the first systematic review , the patients  ' or HCPs '  overall judgment about the likely evolution of LBP was the factor most strongly linked to poor outcome , with predictive validity similar to that of multidimensional scales . This result may be explained by the implicit aggregation of many prognostic factors underlying this judgment and suggests the relevance of considering the patients from biopsychosocial and longitudinal points of view . The second review showed that most of the interventions  targeting  psychosocial factors   in LBP in primary care have to date focused on the  cognitive-behavioral  factors , result ing in little impact . It is unlikely that any intervention focusing on a single factor would ever fit the needs of most patients ; interventions targeting determinants from several fields ( mainly psychosocial , biomechanical , and occupational ) may be more relevant . Should multiple stakeholders be involved in such interventions , enhanced interprofessional collaboration would be critical to ensure the delivery of coordinated care . Finally , in the third study , the  prevalence of psychosocial comorbidity  in  chronic LBP patients  was not found to be significantly higher than in other  patients consulting in primary care .  Rather than specifically screening for psychosocial  conditions  , this suggests taking into account any potential comorbidity in patients with chronic LBP , as in other patients . All these results support the adoption of a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach when dealing with  patients with LBP in primary care .  As this condition is illustrative of many situations encountered in primary care , the strategies proposed here may benefit most  patients  consulting in this setting."

" For the treatment of  LUTS in men and women  ,  combination  therapy appears to be a promising option to optimize the efficacy of the available drugs for those who do not experience sufficient benefit with monotherapy . This add-on scenario offers the possibility to have a more tailored approach to the management of LUTS , always seeking the optimal balance between  efficacy and tolerability  for a given patient . PATIENT SUMMARY Some combination of drugs may offer advantages over monotherapies for the treatment of  voiding and storage complaints  in men and women."
"eAIM ( 1 ) To systematic ally review the literature on developmental outcomes from infancy to adolescence of  children with complex congenital heart disease ( CHD ) who underwent  early surgery  ;  ( 2 ) to run a meta-regression analysis on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development , Second Edition Mental Developmental Index and Psychomotor Developmental Index ( PDI ) of  infants up to 24 months and IQs of preschool-aged children to adolescents ;  ( 3 ) to assess associations between perioperative risk factors and outcomes . METHOD We search ed pertinent  literature ( January 1990 to January 2019 )  in PubMed , Embase , CINAHL , and PsycINFO .  Selection criteria included infants with complex CHD who had primary surgery within the first 9 weeks of life .  Method ological quality , including risk of bias and internal validity , were assessed . RESULTS In total ,  185 papers met the inclusion criteria  ; the 100 with high to  moderate  method ological quality were analysed in detail . Substantial heterogeneity in the group with CHD and in methodology existed . The outcome  of infants with single-ventricle CHD  was inferior to those with two-ventricle CHD ( respectively :  average scores for PDI  77 and 88 ;  intelligence scores  92 and 98 ) . Perioperative risk factors were inconsistently associated with  developmental outcomes .  INTERPRETATION The literature on  children undergoing surgery in early infancy  suggests that infants with a single ventricle are at highest risk of adverse  developmental outcomes .  WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS  Children with complex congenital heart disease (  CHD ) are at increased risk of impaired  developmental outcome .  Children with single-ventricle CHD have  worse outcomes  than children with two-ventricle CHD . Children with two-ventricle CHD gradually grow out of their initial  developmental impairment .  Perioperative factors are inconsistently associated with outcome."

"sBACKGROUND A previous systematic review showed that  atraumatic restorative treatment ( ART )  can be an option to restore the  occlusoproximal cavities in primary teeth ;  however , few studies fulfilled the criteria of inclusion to generate a high level of evidence . AIM To up date the existing systematic review and address questions regarding  survival rate  of  ART restorations  compared to  the conventional approach  in  occlusoproximal cavities in primary molars .  DESIGN The search was extended beyond the original search through the PubMed / MEDLINE data base up to February 2016 . Furthermore , Web of Science and EMBASE were search ed . The inclusion criteria were subjects related to the scope of the systematic review . After selection by title and abstract , potentially eligible articles were read in full and included in accordance with exclusion criteria . Meta- analysis was carried out with the outcome being the  survival rate of restorations .  RESULTS The search strategy identified  560 potentially relevant studies , in addition to 127 from the original systematic review .  A total of  four  articles were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses . Meta- analysis showed no  statistically significant difference between   ART  and conventional approaches  in survival rate of occlusoproximal cavities  ( OR = 0.887 , 95 % CI : 0.574 - 1.371 ) .   ART restorations  have similar  survival rate  compared to  conventional treatment  and can be considered an option to restore occlusoproximal cavities in primary molars."
"nThe beneficial effect of  folic acid supplementation  before and shortly after conception is well recognized , whereas the effect of supplementation during the second and third trimesters is controversial and poorly documented . Our aims were to systematic ally review r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating the effect of  folate supplementation  on  birth weight , placental weight and length of gestation  and to assess the dose – response relationship between  folate intake ( folic acid plus dietary folate )  and health outcomes . The MEDLINE , EMBASE and Cochrane Library CENTRAL data bases were search ed from inception to February 2010 for RCTs in which folate intake and health outcomes in pregnancy were investigated . We calculated the overall intake-health regression coefficient ( β^ ) by using r and om-effects meta- analysis on a loge-loge scale . Data  of 10 studies from 8 RCTs were analyzed  . We found  significant dose – response relationship between folate intake and birth weight  ( P=0.001 ) , the overall β^ was 0.03 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.01 , 0.05 ) . This relationship indicated 2 %  increase in birth weight  for every two-fold increase in folate intake . In contrast , we did not find any  beneficial effect  of   folate supplementation  on placental weight or on length of gestation .  There is a paucity of well-conducted RCTs investigating the effect of   folate supplementation  on health outcomes  in pregnancy . The dose – response methodology outlined in the present systematic review may be useful for design ing clinical studies on  folate supplementation  and for developing recommendations for pregnant women."
"MAbstract Aim  N-3 PUFAs  can potentially influence  levels of inflammatory and non-inflammatory adipokines  . Given the contradictory effects of n-3  PUFAs  on serum levels of adipokines in type 2 diabetes , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis study of r and omized  placebo-controlled  clinical trials that examined the effects of  n-3 PUFAs  on serum levels of leptin and adiponectin in  patients with type 2 diabetes .  Methods The electronic data bases , without regard to language restrictions including PubMed / Medline , Google Scholar , SCOPUS and ISI Web of Science until August 2017 , were used to identify r and omized controlled trials that assessed the effect of  n-3 PUFAs  on  serum leptin  and adiponectin concentrations in type 2 diabetes . Outcomes were extracted based on the mean ± SD as effect size at baseline and end of the intervention . Between- study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I2 estimates and their 95 % CIs . Funnel plot asymmetry was used to investigate the existence of publication bias . Stata software and Review Manager were used for statistical data analysis . Results Data from  10 eligible articles involved 494 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( intervention groups = 254 and control groups = 240 ) , with age between 44 and 70 years  , treated with doses of 0.52–7.4 g/day  n-3  PUFAs  . Adiponectin concentration  nonsignificantly increased by a MD = 0.17 µg/mL ( 95 % CI −  0.11  ,  0.44 )  .  Also , leptin  concentration nonsignificantly reduced by a MD = − 0.31 ng/mL ( 95 % CI − 0.69 , 0.07 ) . Conclusion Plant and marine sources of  n-3 PUFAs  can  modify serum leptin and adiponectin levels  by  increasing  adiponectin and  decreasing  leptin levels in  patients with type 2 diabetes .  Due to some limitations in this study , further studies are needed to reach a definitive conclusion about the effect of n-3  PUFAs  on  the  levels of leptin and adiponectin in T2DM."
"sPurpose The present systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to assess and compare the  safety and efficacy  of  radiofrequency ( RF ) and cryoballoon ( CB ) ablation  for  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) .   RF and CB ablation  are two frequently used methods for pulmonary vein isolation in PAF , but which is a better choice for PAF remains uncertain . Methods A systematic review was conducted in Medline , PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Library . All trials comparing  RF and CB ablation  were screened and included if the inclusion criteria were met . Results A total of  38 eligible studies , 9 prospect i ve r and omized or r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , and 29 non- RCTs were identified , adding up to 15,496 patients .  Pool analyses indicated that  CB ablation  was more beneficial in terms  of procedural time  [ st and ard mean difference = −0.58 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , −0.85 to −0.30 ]  , complications without phrenic nerve injury ( PNI )  [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 0.79 ; 95 % CI , 0.67–0.93 ; I2 = 16 % ] , and  recrudescence  ( OR = 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.70–0.97 ; I2 = 63 % ) for PAF ; however ,  the total complications  of  CB  was higher than RF . The subgroup analysis found that , compared with non-contact force radiofrequency ( non-CF-RF ) , both  first-generation cryoballoon ( CB1 ) and second-generation cryoballoon ( CB2 ) ablation   could reduce complications with PNI , procedural time , and recrudescence  .  However  ,  the safety and efficacy  of  CB2  was similar to those of CF-RF . Conclusion Available overall and subgroup data suggested that both  CB1 and CB2  were more beneficial than RF  ablation  , and the main advantages were reflected in comparing them with non-CF-RF . However , CF-RF and  CB2  showed similar clinical benefits."
" . A potential  VPA  dose is identified as yielding favorable  health benefits in adiposity and fitness .  While CM biomarkers were not consistently associated with PA intensity level , the literature suggests  VPA  may yield health benefits above those received from  MPA  for reduced  adiposity  and  improved CRF .  This review highlights the need for longitudinal observational and experimental studies to determine optimal  VPA  dose for CM health in youth."
" Recommendations on the assessment of agitation emphasise the importance of identifying any possible medical cause . For its management , experts agreed in considering   verbal de-escalation   and   environmental modification techniques   as first choice , considering physical restraint as a last resort strategy . Regarding pharmacological treatment , the "" ideal "" medication should  calm  without over-se date . Generally , oral or inhaled formulations should be preferred over i.m . routes in  mildly agitated patients .  Intravenous treatments should be avoided."

"eCardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , and a key barrier to improved outcomes is medication non-adherence . The aim of this study is to review the role of  mobile health ( mHealth ) tools  for improving medication adherence in  patients with cardiovascular disease .  We performed a systematic search for r and omized controlled trials that primarily investigated  mHealth tools  for improving adherence to cardiovascular disease medications in  patients with hypertension , coronary artery disease , heart failure , peripheral arterial disease , and stroke .  We extracted and review ed data on the types of  mHealth tools  used , preferences of patients and healthcare providers , the effect of the mHealth interventions on medication adherence , and the limitations of trials . We identified  10 completed trials matching our selection criteria , mostly with < 100 participants , and ranging in duration from 1 to 18 months .   mHealth tools  included text  messages  ,  Bluetooth-enabled  electronic  pill  boxes , online messaging platforms , and interactive voice calls . Patients and healthcare providers generally preferred  mHealth  to other interventions . All 10 studies reported that  mHealth interventions   improved medication adherence  , though the magnitude of benefit was not consistently large and in one study was not greater than a telehealth comparator . Limitations of trials included small sample sizes , short duration of follow-up , self-reported outcomes , and insufficient assessment of  unintended harms  and  financial implication  s. Current evidence suggests that  mHealth tools  can  improve medication adherence  in  patients with cardiovascular diseases .  However , high- quality clinical trials of sufficient size and duration are needed to move the field forward and justify use in routine care."
"  Psychotic depression  is heavily understudied , limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn . Some evidence indicates that  combination therapy with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic  is more  effective  than either  treatment alone or placebo .

" Walking interventions  , particularly those conducted in the school environment , have the potential to  increase PA  in  children and adolescents .   on which interventions most  effectively increased walking behaviours  in this population were hindered by the limited number of identified interventions and the short duration of interventions evaluated . The short-term effectiveness of the majority of included studies on  levels of walking  in this population is promising and further research , particularly within non-educational setting s and targeted at sub-groups ( e.g.  adolescent girls and overweight/obese children and adolescents )  , is warranted."
"dAIMS To assess the association between  atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and  all-cause  mortality and  implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) therapies   in  heart failure ( HF ) patients with reduced ejection fraction and an ICD implanted .  METHODS AND RESULTS A systematic MEDLINE search performed from inception through November 2016 , supplemented by h and search ing of reference lists , identified  62 eligible studies ( 227 998 patients ) reporting on the association between AF and outcomes in HF patients ;  36  studies  included data on  all-cause  mortality , 30 on appropriate , and 17 on inappropriate ICD interventions .  Hazard ratio , risk ratio , or odds ratio estimates  were used based on data availability . Effect estimates were synthesized under a r and om-effects model .  Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator-implanted  HF  patients  with a history of AF had a 42 % { combined effect estimate ( cEE ) 1.42 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.28 - 1.57 ] } higher  risk of all-cause mortality  compared with patients with no AF history . Furthermore , AF patients had a higher  risk of appropriate  [ cEE 1.44 ( 95 % CI 1.27 - 1.64 ) ] and  inappropriate ICD interventions  [ cEE 2.05 ( 95 % CI 1.75 - 2.44 ) ] .  Atrial fibrillation history is statistically significantly associated with adverse major clinical outcomes in  ICD-implanted HF patients . Patients with AF  have a higher  risk of all-cause mortality , appropriate , and inappropriate ICD interventions  compared with  patients  with no AF history . Whether AF may have an independent deleterious effect on HF prognosis or may simply be a marker of HF severity should be further investigated."
" The use of  financial incentives  to reward PCPs for improving the quality of primary healthcare services is growing . However , there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of  financial incentives  to improve the quality of primary  health care .  Implementation should proceed with caution and  incentive schemes  should be more carefully design ed before implementation . In addition to basing incentive design more on theory , there is a large literature discussing experiences with these schemes that can be used to draw out a number of lessons that can be learned and that could be used to influence or modify the design of incentive schemes . More rigorous study design s need to be used to account for the selection of physicians into incentive schemes . The use of instrumental variable techniques should be considered to assist with the identification of treatment effects in the presence of selection bias and other sources of unobserved heterogeneity . In r and omised trials , care must be taken in using the correct unit of analysis and more attention should be paid to blinding . Studies should also examine the potential unintended consequences of  incentive schemes  by having a stronger theoretical basis , including a broader range of outcomes , and conducting more extensive subgroup analysis . Studies should more consistently describe i ) the type of  payment  scheme at baseline or in the control group , ii ) how  payments to medical groups  were used and distributed within the groups , and iii ) the  size of the new payments  as a  percentage  of  total revenue  . Further research comparing the relative costs and effects of  financial incentives  with other behaviour change interventions is also required."

"sBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The association between excessive  early  migration of acetabular cups   and  late aseptic revision  has been scantily reported . We therefore performed 2 parallel systematic review s and meta-analyses to determine the association between  early migration of  acetabular cups   and late aseptic revision . METHODS One review covered  early migration  data from  radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) studies  , while the other focused on revision rates for aseptic loosening from long-term survival studies . Thresholds for acceptable and unacceptable migration were classified according the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register and the Australian National Joint Replacement Registry : < 5 % revision at 10 years . RESULTS Following an elaborate literature search ,  26 studies ( involving 700 cups ) were included in the RSA review and 49 studies ( involving 38,013 cups ) were included in the  survival review . For every mm increase in 2-year proximal migration , there was a 10 % increase in  revision rate  , which remained after correction for age , sex , diagnosis , hospital type , continent , and study quality . Consequently , proximal migration of up to 0.2 mm was considered acceptable and proximal migration of 1.0 mm or more was considered unacceptable . Cups with proximal migration of between 0.2 and 1.0 mm were considered to be at risk of having  revision rates  higher than 5 % at 10 years . INTERPRETATION There was a clinical ly relevant association between  early  migration of acetabular cups   and  late revision due to loosening .  The proposed migration thresholds can be implemented in a phased evidence -based introduction , since they allow early detection of high-risk cups while exposing a small number of patients."
"sExisting evidence on the possible effects of  synbiotics  on  lipid profile  is inconclusive . The aim of the present systematic review was to clarify the effects of  synbiotics  consumption on  lipid profile .

"sAbstract A systematic review of the Bristol‐Myers Squibb  normal healthy volunteers ( NHVs ) data  base identified phase 1 trials that included NHVs  administered placebo  with the aim of characterizing normal inter‐ and intraindividual safety parameter variability . Twenty‐five single and multiple ascending dose studies , median duration 28 ( 2 to 63 ) days , were included in the pooled  analysis ( 355 NHVs )  .  Laboratory evaluations , vital signs , electrocardiograms , and adverse events  were assessed . The most commonly occurring adverse event  was headache  ( 28 [ 7.9 % ] NHVs ; 519.5 events/100 person‐years ) . During the dosing period (  on  placebo  )  , evaluations showed 5.1 events/100  measures of alanine aminotransferase  and 7.3 events/100 measures of creatine kinase 1 × above the  upper  limit of  normal . Alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase elevations  occurred in 28 ( 7.9 % ) and 39 ( 11.0 % ) NHVs , respectively ; 105 ( 30.3 % ) NHVs  had low  and 46 ( 13.3 % )  had high diastolic blood pressure  . This analysis may inform future study design s and provide a context for interpretation of safety signals in early phase clinical trials."

"sObjective : A systematic literature review and meta- analysis on the effectiveness of  lifestyle restrictions and pre caution s  to prevent  dislocation after total hip arthroplasty .  Data sources : MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were search ed in February 2015 , with additional h and search ing of systematic review s and reference lists . Review methods : This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic review s and meta- analysis . PubMed and the Cochrane Library were search ed from their start date through to February 2015 . R and omized controlled trials and comparative case series in English , Dutch or German language were included . Only  primary total hip arthroplasty procedures  managed with different postoperative  restrictions and pre caution s protocol s  were included . Primary outcome was the  total hip arthroplasty dislocation rate  , secondary outcomes were  patient functioning , return to activities of daily living and patient satisfaction .  Results :  A total of 119 eligible articles were identified , six were included :  three r and omized controlled trials , one retrospective matched cohort study  , one retrospective and one prospect i ve cohort study , describing 1122 procedures ( restrictions group : n = 528 ; no restrictions group : n = 594 ) .  Both the st and ard posterior and anterolateral surgical approaches were included . There were eight  dislocations  ( 1.5 % ) in the restricted group , vs. six dislocations ( 1.0 % ) in the unrestricted group . Patients in the unrestricted group  resumed activities significantly  faster and were more  satisfied  with their  pace of recovery .  Conclusion : A  more liberal lifestyle restrictions and pre caution s protocol  will not lead to worse  dislocation rates  after  total  hip arthroplasty , but will lead to earlier and  better resumption of activities  and  higher patient satisfaction .  These results appear to hold up for various surgical approaches."
"dBackground There is currently no systematic review examining the effects of  vitamin D supplementation   among athletes .  A rigorous systematic review and meta- analysis is important to provide a balanced view of current knowledge on the effect of  vitamin D  on  serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] concentrations  and  physical performance  . Objectives This systematic review of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluated the effects of  oral vitamin D supplementation  on  serum 25(OH)D concentrations  and physical performance in  athletes .  Methods Multiple electronic data bases were search ed , and study eligibility , method ological quality assessment , and data extraction were completed independently and in duplicate . Studies were stratified by baseline vitamin D sufficiency , season , and latitude . A cut-off of 30 ng/ml ( 75 nmol/l ) of 25(OH)D was used for sufficiency .  Absolute mean differences ( AMDs )  between  vitamin  D  and  placebo using r and om effects analysis , and heterogeneity using Q statistic and I2 index , were calculated . AMD with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , p value , and I2 are reported . Results In total ,  13 RCTs ( 2005–2016 ) with 532 athletes  ( vitamin D  311 , placebo 221 ) were eligible .  A total of  433 athletes  (  vitamin D  244 ,  placebo  189  ) had complete outcome data  . Among athletes with baseline values suggesting insufficiency  , vitamin D supplementation  led to significant increases from 3000 IU ( AMD 15.2 ng/ml ; 95 % CI 10.7–19.7 , p < 0.0001 , I2 = 0 % ) and 5000 IU ( AMD 27.8 ng/ml ; 95 % CI 16.9–38.8 , p < 0.0001 , I2 = 78 % ) per day at > 45 ° latitudes . Both doses led to  sufficiency  concentrations during winter months . Among athletes with baseline vitamin D suggesting sufficiency  , serum 25(OH)D sufficiency  was maintained from different doses at both latitudes . Of 13 included trials , only seven measured different physical performances and none demonstrated a significant effect  of  vitamin D supplementation during 12 weeks of follow-up . Conclusion Despite achieving sufficiency in vitamin D concentrations from ≥3000 IU supplementation  , physical performance  did not significantly improve . Between- study heterogeneity was large , and well- design ed RCTs examining the effect  of vitamin D  supplementation  on serum 25(OH)D concentrations , physical performance , and injuries in  different  sports  ,  latitudes , ethnicities  ,  and vitamin D status  are needed."
"eThe purpose of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to investigate  omega-3 fatty acids  ’ influence on  12 inflammatory biomarkers — LDL , HDL , total cholesterol , TG , HbA1c , Apo AI , Apo AII , Apo B , CRP , TNF-α , glucose , and fasting blood glucose  among  diabetic and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) patients .  We search ed articles in six data base engines , and  16 of the 696 articles review ed met the inclusion criteria  . Among these , lipid  and inflammatory  biomarkers investigated commonly  included total cholesterol  ( 11 studies )  , LDL , and TG  ( 10 studies each ) . Overall  , omega-3  was associated with a significant  reduction in Apo AII  among diabetic patients , as compared to different controls ( −8.0 mg/dL 95 % CI : −12.71 , −3.29 ,  p  =  0.0009 ) , triglycerides  ( −44.88 mg/dL 95 % CI : −82.6 , −7.16 , p <  0.0001 ) , HDL  ( −2.27 mg/dL 95 % CI : −3.72 , −0.83 , p = 0.002  ) , and increased fasting blood glucose  ( 16.14 mg/dL 95 % CI : 6.25 , 26.04 , p =  0.001 )  . Omega-3 also was associated  with increased LDL  among CVD patients ( 2.10 mg/dL 95 % CI : 1.00 , 3.20 , p = 0.0002 ) . We conclude  that omega-3 fatty acids  may be associated with  lower inflammatory  biomarkers  among diabetic and cardiovascular patients .  Clinicians should be aware of these potential benefits ; however , it is essential to recommend that patients consult with clinicians before any  omega-3  intake."
"sPhosphodiesterase  type-5 inhibitors ( PDE5-Is )  have been recommended as first line therapy for  erectile dysfunction for patients received nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer .  We examed the efficiency of  PDE5-Is  and considered the optimal application . Systematic search of PubMed , Embase and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify all the studies .  We identified 103 studies including 3175 patients , of which 14 were recruited for systematic review .  Compared with  placebo , PDE5-Is  significantly ameliorated  the International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain score ( IIEF ) scores  ( MD 4.89 , 95 % CI 4.25–5.53 , p < 0.001 ) . By network meta- analysis , sildenafil seems to be the most efficiency with a slightly  higher rate of treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEATs )  , whereas tadalafil had the lowest  TEATs  . In  terms of IIEF scores  , regular regimen was remarkably better than on-dem and ( MD 3.28 , 95 % CI 1.67–4.89 , p < 0.001 ) . Regular use was not associated with  higher proportion of patients suffering TEATs compared with  on-dem and ( RR 1.02 , 95 % CI 0.90–1.16 , p = 0.72 ) . Compared  with placebo , PDE5-Is  manifested significantly  improved treatment outcomes  . Overall , regular regimen demonstrated statistically  pronounced better potency than on-dem  and . Coupled with the comparable  rate  of  side effects  , these findings support the regular delivery procedure to be a  cost-effective  option for patients."

"sBACKGROUND : Currently , there is no evidence -based definition for concussion that is being uniformly applied in clinical and research setting s. OBJECTIVE : To conduct a systematic review of the highest- quality literature about concussion and to assemble evidence about the prevalence and associations of key indicators of concussion . The goal was to establish an evidence -based foundation from which to derive , in future work , a definition , diagnostic criteria , and prognostic indicators for concussion . METHODS : Key questions were developed , and an electronic literature search from  1980 to 2012  was conducted to acquire evidence about the prevalence of and associations among signs , symptoms , and neurologic and cognitive deficits in  sample s of individuals exposed to potential concussive events .  Included studies were assessed for potential for bias and confound and rated as high , medium , or low potential for bias and confound . Those rated as high were excluded from the analysis . Studies were further triaged on the basis of whether the definition of a case of concussion was exclusive or inclusive ; only those with wide , inclusive case definitions were used in the analysis . Finally , only studies reporting data collected at fixed time points were used . For a study to be included in the conclusions , it was required that the presence of any particular sign , symptom , or deficit be reported in at least 2 independent sample s. RESULTS : From  5437 abstract s , 1362 full-text publications were review ed  , of  which 231 studies were included in the final library .  Twenty-six met all criteria required to be used in the analysis , and of those , 11  independent  sample s from 8 publications directly contributed data to conclusions . Prevalent and consistent indicators of concussion are ( 1 )  observed and documented disorientation or confusion immediately after the event ,  ( 2 )  impaired balance within 1 day after injury ,  ( 3  ) slower reaction time within 2 days after injury  ,  and /or (  4 )  impaired verbal learning and memory  within 2 days after injury .  : The results of this systematic review identify the consistent and prevalent indicators of concussion and their associations , derived from the strongest evidence in the published literature . The product is an evidence -based foundation from which to develop diagnostic criteria and prognostic indicators."
"sRapid  tranquilization  is an intervention used in control of agitation or aggression in  patients with mental disorders .  This study synthesized the available evidence regarding  efficacy and safety  of drugs used for rapid tranquilization in  psychiatric patients with psychomotor agitation .  It is an overview study of systematic review s and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) identified in the data base MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , Web of Science , Cochrane Library and LILACS until April 2015 . A team of review ers , in pairs and independently , identified eligible studies and assessed method ological quality using AMSTAR . Data were extracted from  four studies ( 61 RCT , 8021 participants ) .  The association of  haloperidol  with promethazine ( H + P )  promoted tranquilization  and presented  better safety profile  , with  moderate quality evidence .   Olanzapine  demonstrated  benefit towards tranquilization and good safety profile  , but needed additional administration to  keep tranquilization .  There was no benefit in the use of  haloperidol  alone or associated to another psychotropic to most outcomes evaluated . The evidence was of low quality to most of the interventions . H + P was considered a good  option for rapid tranquilization  , however , more RCT are necessary to confirm the  efficacy and safety  of the available interventions."
"dOBJECTIVE : To review the current status of  antibiotic  prophylaxis  for cesarean delivery  , emerging strategies to enhance the effectiveness of  antibiotic prophylaxis  in reducing   postcesarean infection   , and the implication s of the emerging practice s. DATA SOURCES : We conducted a full PubMed  ( January 1966 to July 2008 )  search using the key words “  cesarean ”  and “  antibiotic  prophylaxis  .  ” A  total of 277 articles were identified  and supplemented by a bibliographic search . METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION : We  selected a total of 15 studies , which included  all published clinical trials , meta-analyses of clinical trials , and observational studies evaluating either the timing of  antibiotics  or the use of  extended-spectrum prophylaxis .  We also review ed nine reports involving national recommendations or technical review s supporting current st and ards for antibiotic prophylaxis . TABULATION , INTEGRATION , AND RESULTS : We conducted an analytic review and tabulation of selected studies without further meta- analysis . Although current guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis recommend the administration of narrow-spectrum  antibiotics ( cefazolin )  after clamping of the umbilical cord , the data suggest that antibiotic administration before surgical incision or the use of extended-spectrum regimens ( involving  azithromycin  or  metronidazole )  after cord clamp may reduce  postcesarean maternal infection  by up to 50 % . However , these two strategies have not been compared with each other . In addition , their effect on  neonatal infection  or  infection  with resistant organisms warrants further study .  : The use of either  cefazolin  alone before surgical incision or an extended-spectrum regimen after cord clamp seems to be associated with a reduction in   postcesarean maternal infection .   Confirmatory studies focusing additionally on neonatal outcomes and the effect on resistant organisms , as well as studies comparing both strategies , are needed."
"sAnxiety is a common problem in  children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .  This meta- analysis aim ed to systematic ally evaluate the evidence for the use of  psychosocial interventions  to manage  anxiety  in this population .  Cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT )  was the primary intervention modality studied . A comprehensive systematic search and study selection process was conducted . Separate statistical analyses were carried out for  clinician- , parent- , and self-reported outcome measures .  Sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing any outlying studies and any studies that did not use a  CBT intervention  . A subgroup analysis was performed to compare individual and group delivery of treatment .  Ten r and omised control trials involving a total of 470 participants were included .  The  overall SMD  was d = 1.05 ( 95 % CI 0.45 , 1.65 ; z = 3.45 , p = 0.0006 ) for  clinician- reported outcome measures ;  d = 1.00 ( 95%CI 0.21 , 1.80 ; z = 2.47 , p = 0.01 ) for  parent-reported outcome measures ;  and d = 0.65 ( 95%CI -0.10 , 1.07 ; z = 1.63 , p = 0.10 ) for  self-reported outcome measures . Clinician- and parent-reported outcome measures  showed that psychosocial interventions were superior to  waitlist  and  treatment-as-usual  control conditions at post-treatment . However , the  results of self-reported outcome measures  failed to reach significance . The sensitivity analyses did not significantly change these results and the subgroup analysis indicated that individual treatment was more effective than group treatment . The main limitations of this review were the small number of included studies as well as the clinical and method ological variability between studies."
"kDual-task interference during walking can substantially limit  mobility  and increase the risk of   falls  among community-dwelling older adults .  Previous systematic review s examining intervention effects on  dual-task gait  and  mobility  have not assessed  relative dual-task costs ( DTC )  or investigated whether there are differences in treatment-related changes based on the type of dual task or the type of control group . The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effects of  physical exercise interventions  on  dual-task performance  during walking in older adults . A meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) compared treatment effects between  physical exercise intervention and control groups  on  single- and dual-task gait speed and relative DTC on gait speed .  A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the electronic data bases PubMed , CINAHL , EMBASE , Web of Science , and PsycINFO search ed up to September 19 , 2014 . R and omized , nonr and omized , and uncontrolled studies published in  English and involving older adults  were selected . Studies had to include a  physical exercise intervention protocol  and measure  gait parameters  during continuous , unobstructed walking in single- and dual-task conditions before and after the intervention .  Of 614 abstract s , 21 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review . Fourteen RCTs were included in  the meta-  analysis  . The mean difference between the intervention and control groups significantly favored the intervention for  single-task gait speed  ( mean difference : 0.06 m/s , 95 % CI : 0.03 , 0.10 , p < 0.001 ) ,  dual-task gait speed  ( mean difference : 0.11 m/s , 95 % CI 0.07 , 0.15 , p <  0.001  ) , and  DTC on gait speed  ( mean difference : 5.23 % , 95 % CI 1.40 , 9.05 , p = 0.007 ) . Evidence from subgroup comparisons showed no  difference  in  treatment-related changes between cognitive-motor and motor-motor dual tasks  , or when interventions were compared to active or inactive controls . In  summary , physical exercise interventions  can improve  dual-task walking  in  older adults  primarily by increasing  the speed at which individuals walk in dual-task conditions  . Currently , evidence concerning whether  physical exercise interventions  reduce  DTC  or alter the  self-selected dual-task strategy  during unobstructed walking is greatly lacking , mainly due to the failure of studies to measure and report reciprocal dual-task effects on the non-gait task."
"gResults of recent studies suggest that circulating levels of  vitamin D  may play an important role in cancer-specific outcomes . The present systematic review was undertaken to determine the prevalence of  vitamin  D   deficiency  ( < 25 nmol/L ) and insufficiency ( 25 - 50 nmol/L ) in cancer patients  and to evaluate the association between circulating calcidiol ( the indicator of vitamin D status ) and clinical outcomes .

Children and people with frequent  severe asthma  exacerbations were under-represented  ; additional primary trials are needed to establish whether  vitamin D  can reduce the  risk of severe asthma exacerbation  in these groups."
":Study Design . A systematic review and meta- analysis . Objective . To assess the measurement properties of the  Functional  Rating  Index ( FRI )  and determine whether its measurement properties are comparable with other region-specific question naires . Summary of Background Data . In addition to low back pain ( LBP ) and neck  pain  (  NP  ) ,  multiregion spinal pain ( SP )  is a common problem with a considerable prevalence in the  general population .  The FRI was built to assess physical functioning in  patients with SP .  However , a systematic review assessing evidence of its measurement properties in separated population s and a comparison with other question naires regarding each measurement property is lacking . Methods . Articles concerning the  FRI 's  measurement properties or head-to-head comparison with other question naires on measurement properties were obtained from MEDLINE , Embase , CINAHL , and PsycINFO . Two review ers independently review ed the articles , extracted data , and conducted the method ological quality assessment . The COnsensus-based St and ards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments ( COSMIN ) checklist was used to assess the method ological quality of the included studies . Results . A  total of 18 studies evaluating the  FRI 's measurement properties  ,  including  seven  that carried out head-to-head comparisons in at least one measurement property with other question naires , were  included  in the current review . Our findings show strong positive evidence  for structural validity and internal consistency  in  patients with SP and LBP .  Evidence for most of the  FRI 's measurement properties  is limited , conflicting , or even unknown . The current evidence shows that the FRI is comparable with both the  Oswestry Disability Index and the Neck Disability Index  in responsiveness . However , relevant information about the majority of the other measurement properties is lacking . Conclusion . Our finding suggests that clinicians and research ers should use the  FRI  with caution until there are more studies with high method ological quality that support the view that it is positive in all measurement properties , especially in regard to  patients with multiregion SP .

"nEstablished primary  prevention strategies  of cardiovascular diseases are based on underst and ing of risk factors , but whether the same risk factors are associated with   atrial fibrillation ( AF )   remains unclear . We conducted a systematic review and field synopsis of the associations of  23 cardiovascular risk factors and incident AF , which included 84 reports based on 28 consented and four electronic health record cohorts of 20,420,175 participants and 576,602 AF events .  We identified 3 - 19 reports per risk factor and heterogeneity in AF definition , quality of reporting , and adjustment . We extracted  relative risks  ( RR ) and 95 % confidence intervals [ CI ] and visualised the number of reports with inverse ( RR [CI]<1.00 ) , or direct ( RR [CI]>1.00 ) associations . For hypertension ( 13/17 reports ) and obesity ( 19/19 reports ) , there were direct associations with  incident AF  , as there are for coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . There were inverse associations for  non-White ethnicity  ( 5/5 reports , with RR from 0.35 to 0.84 [ 0.82 - 0.85 ] ) ,  total cholesterol  ( 4/13 reports from 0.76 [ 0.59 - 0.98 ] to 0.94 [ 0.90 - 0.97 ] ; 8/13 reports with non-significant inverse associations ) , and  diastolic blood pressure  ( 2/11 reports from 0.87 [ 0.78 - 0.96 ] to 0.92 [ 0.85 - 0.99 ] ; 5/11 reports with non-significant inverse associations ) , and direct associations for  taller height  ( 7/10 reports from 1.03 [ 1.02 - 1.05 ] to 1.92 [ 1.38 - 2.67 ] ) , which are in the opposite direction of known associations with CHD . A systematic evaluation of the available evidence suggests similarities as well as important differences in the risk factors for incidence of  AF  as compared with other cardiovascular diseases , which has implication s for the primary prevention strategies for atrial fibrillation."
"nCurrent recommendations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes advise modification of diet and  exercise  behaviors including both  aerobic  and  resistance training .  However , the efficacy of multi-component  interventions  involving a combination of these three components has not been established . The aims of this review were to systematic ally review and meta-analyze the evidence on  multi-component ( diet + aerobic exercise + resistance training ) lifestyle interventions  for type 2 diabetes prevention . Eight electronic data bases ( Medline , Embase , SportD iscus , Web of Science , CINAHL , Informit health collection , Cochrane library and Scopus ) were search ed up to June 2013 .  Eligible studies 1 ) recruited prediabetic adults or individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes ; 2 ) conducted  diet and exercise [  including  both physical activity/aerobic and resistance training ] programs  ; and 3 ) reported weight and plasma glucose outcomes .  In total ,  23 articles from eight studies were eligible  including five r and omized controlled trials , one quasi-experimental , one two-group comparison and one single-group pre-post study . Four studies had a low risk of bias ( score ≥ 6/10 ) . Median intervention length was 12 months ( range 4–48 months ) with a follow-up of 18 months ( range 6.5 - 48 months ) .   The diet and exercise  interventions  varied slightly in terms of their specific prescriptions . Meta- analysis favored interventions over controls  for weight loss  ( -3.79 kg [ -6.13 , -1.46 ; 95 % CI ] , Z = 3.19 ,  P = 0.001 ) and fasting plasma glucose  ( -0.13 mmol . L-1 [ -0.24 , -0.02 ; 95 % CI ] , Z =  2.42 , P = 0.02 ) . Diabetes  incidence was only reported in two studies , with reductions of 58 % and 56 % versus control groups . In summary , multi-component lifestyle type 2 diabetes prevention interventions that  include diet and both aerobic and resistance exercise training  are  modestly effective in inducing weight loss and improving impaired fasting glucose , glucose tolerance , dietary and exercise outcomes  in  at risk and prediabetic adult population  s. These results support the current exercise guidelines for the inclusion of resistance training in type 2 diabetes prevention , however there remains a need for more rigorous studies , with long-term follow-up  evaluating program efficacy  ,  muscular fitness outcomes  , diabetes incidence and risk reduction."
" This systematic review supports the need for comprehensive yoga research guidelines . Findings reveal a lack of reporting of intervention details , the need to report a disease-specific rationale for selection of the particular yoga style used for the intervention , and that a limited number of yoga styles have been investigated in persons with fibromyalgia."
"sAlthough arousal mechanisms have frequently been found to be atypical in ADHD , these findings usually emerged from indirect behavioural measures which give only a limited underst and ing of arousal dysregulation in this condition . To assess the hypothesis that functioning of the autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) , one component of arousal , is atypical in ADHD , we carried out a systematic review of the literature on  55 studies investigating   electro-dermal , heart rate  and  pupillometry measures    under different experimental conditions ( resting-state , cognitive tasks and in response to  reinforcers  or  socio-emotional stimuli )  . Our literature review identified  ANS dysfunction  in  individuals with ADHD  , more often in the direction of hypo-arousal than hyper-arousal , particularly at rest and during tasks requiring response regulation and sustained attention . Almost half of the reported findings were null .  Stimulant medications   increased ANS activity  and , in some studies , reinforcers and rewards produced a  similar effect  , suggesting that ANS function can be modified in ADHD . Further research is needed to assess the influence of comorbid symptoms and to explore method ological parameters that may influence findings."
" This overall outcome is in agreement with the conclusions of the original systematic review . Although the findings of the trials identified in this up date may be considered to be less affected by attrition- and publication bias , their risk of selection - and detection-/performance bias is high . Thus , verification of the currently available results requires further high quality r and omised control trials."
" The present systematic review and meta- analysis indicate similar clinical performances  of bulk-fill and conventional resin composites  over a follow-up period of 12 to 72 months . Clinical significance Based on the results of this study ,  the bulk-fill resin composites  could be an alternative for direct restorations in posterior teeth . However , clinical trials of longer duration are required."
"sLong-Acting  Injectable Antipsychotics ( LAIs )  are used to overcome non-compliance in psychoses , mainly schizophrenia spectrum disorders . We aim ed to summarize available evidence of studies comparing the efficacy of  LAIs  to  placebo  or oral  medications  for  Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) and /or Schizoaffective Disorder ( SAD ) .  We search ed  six data bases from inception to 28-March-2018  , using the strategy : long-acting antipsychotics AND ( bipolar disorder OR schizoaffective disorder OR mania OR manic OR bipolar depression ) . We included peer- review ed double-blind comparisons of  LAIs  for any clinical outcome occurrence in BD , or open mirror studies with same prospect i ve as retrospective assessment periods . We excluded studies reporting on  mixed schizophrenia/SAD population  s without reporting results separately .  The pooled records amounted to 642 .  After duplicate removal and inclusion /exclusion criteria application , we included  15 studies , 6 double-blind and 9 open , 13 assessing BD and 2 SAD .  Depot neuroleptics prevented  manic  , but not  depressive recurrences  and may  worsen depressive symptoms .   Risperidone  long-acting injectable was found to be  effective  in  protecting from any mood/manic symptom  compared to  placebo  , but not from  depressive recurrences .  Add-on or monotherapy  paliperidone palmitate  in  SAD patients   protected from psychotic , depressive , and manic symptoms .  In  patients with BD-I with a manic episode at study enrolment  ,  aripiprazole  monohydrate significantly  delayed time to recurrence of manic episodes  without  inducing depressive episodes .   LAIs   are effective and well-tolerated maintenance treatments  for  BD and SAD .  They  showed better efficacy in preventing mania than depression .   LAIs  may be first-line for  BD-I and SAD patients with a manic predominant polarity and  with  non-adherence  problems."
"  HT  treatment with estrogens alone or in combination with progestogens was associated with a small to moderate  improvement in sexual function  , particularly in pain , when used in women with menopausal symptoms or in early postmenopause ( within five years of amenorrhoea ) , but not in unselected postmenopausal women . Evidence regarding other HTs ( synthetic steroids and SERMs ) is of low quality and we are uncertain of their effect  on sexual function  . The current evidence does not suggest an important effect of tibolone or of SERMs alone or combined with  estrogens on sexual function  . More studies evaluating the effect of synthetic steroids , SERMS and the association of SERM + estrogens would improve the quality of the evidence for the effect of these treatments  on sexual function  in peri and postmenopausal women . Future studies should also evaluate the effect  of HT  solely among women with sexual complaints."
"5Introduction There is little epidemiological evidence and knowledge about  at-risk alcohol use among community-dwelling older adults  and  their chronic and acute alcohol-related comorbidities of interest  . This systematic review will summarise and examine relevant studies about the epidemiology of  at-risk alcohol use and associated comorbidities of interest in this population .  Methods We will search the following data bases , without language or date restrictions , from inception  to 31 August 2019 :  Embase .com ,  Medline  Ovid SP , Pubmed ( NOT medline [ sb ] ) , CINAHL EBSCO , PsycINFO Ovid SP , Central —Cochrane Library Wiley and Web of Science ( Core Collection ) . Search strategies will be developed in collaboration with a librarian . We will use predefined search terms for alcoholism , epidemiology , the elderly , living place and comorbidities of interest , as well as terms related to the identification of “ measurements ” , “ tools ” or “ instruments ” for measuring harm from alcohol use . At-risk status will be determined by the amount of alcohol consumed and any comorbidities of interest associated with at-risk alcohol use , with the latter being documented separately or using an assessment tool for at-risk drinking . We will also examine the bibliographies of all the relevant articles found and search for unpublished studies . We will consider publications in all language s. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is necessary . Results will be presented in national and international conferences on addiction and published in a peer- review ed journal .

" Improvement in control of  maternal blood pressure  with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and /or baby , and none have been clearly demonstrated . The effect of  beta-blockers  on  perinatal outcome  is uncertain ; the worrying trend to an increase in  SGA infants  is partly dependent on one small outlying trial . Large r and omised trials are needed to determine whether  antihypertensive therapy  in general ( rather than  beta-blocker therapy  specifically ) results in greater  benefit  than risk , for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension . If so , then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best , and beta-blockers should be evaluated."
" Current evidence is insufficient to show benefit of  intravenous iron preparations  for the treatment of  non-anaemic iron deficiency  across a variety of  patient  population s , beyond stating that it may result in a small , clinical ly insignificant increase in  haemoglobin concentration  . However , the certainty for even this outcome remains limited . Robust data for the effectiveness of  intravenous iron  for non-anaemic iron deficiency is still lacking , and larger studies are required to assess the effect of this therapy on laboratory , patient-centric , and adverse-effect outcomes."
"sHealth  resort medicine ( HRM ;  in German : Kurortmedizin ) is a field of medicine with long-lasting tradition in several European countries . A number of systematic review s have shown the  effectiveness of  HRM   in musculoskeletal conditions . Review s focusing on the  effectiveness  of  HRM  in non-musculoskeletal disorders are rare . This systematic review aims to provide an overview about all  types of health resort treatments  applied in non-musculoskeletal conditions , to summarize evidence for its effectiveness and to assess the quality of published studies . MEDLINE , Web of Knowledge and Embase were search ed for  articles published between January 2002 and December 2013 .  We used a broad search strategy in order to find studies investigating the effects of  HRM  in non-musculoskeletal disorders . Two authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the  Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool  for  Quantitative Studies (  EPHPP-QAT ) .  Forty-one studies ( 19 of them with control group ) from eight countries examining the  efficacy  of various forms of spa treatment for 12 disease groups were included .  The studies are markedly heterogeneous regarding study design , population and treatment .  HRM   treatment  is  associated with clinical improvement  in  diseases of the skin , respiratory , circulatory , digestive and nervous system  among others . However , small sample s , the lack of control groups and an insufficient follow-up often limit the generated evidence . The scientific literature of the last decade has shown that a number of non-musculoskeletal disorders are treated with different kinds of   HRM .   The challenge for the future will be to carry out thoroughly design ed studies in larger patient population s to corroborate the  impact of  HRM  treatment  on non-musculoskeletal disorders."
"yBackground  Atrial  fibrillation  ( AF ) among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF )  is associated with adverse clinical outcomes . Our primary aim was to evaluate  patient-centered outcomes  and surrogate  outcomes  following  catheter ablation ( CA ) of AF  among  patients with HFrEF compared to  st and ard medical therapy  with or without device therapy ( atrioventricular node ablation and cardiac resynchronization therapy ) .  Methods A systematic literature review was performed limiting our search es to r and omized control trials reporting outcomes of  CA  compared to  st and ard medical therapy with or without device therapy  were included . Patient-centered outcomes were relative reduction in  all-cause mortality , heart failure readmissions , and recurrence of AF .  Surrogate outcomes of interest were  change in ejection fraction , change in peak oxygen consumption , reduction in brain natriuretic peptide levels , change in 6-minute walk distance , and change in Minnesota living with heart failure score .  Results  Seven r and omized control trials ( Patient n = 721 )  met our inclusion criteria . All trials used  radiofrequency energy for CA of  AF .  CA  for AF was associated with significantly lower  all-cause mortality  ( Risk ratio [ RR ] = 0.52 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.35 - 0.76 , P = 0.001 , I 2 = 0 % ) ,  lower rate of heart failure readmission  ( RR = 0.58 , 95 % CI = 0.46 - 0.74 , P < 0.001 , I 2 = 0 % ) and  lower rate of AF recurrence  ( RR = 0.33 , 95 % CI = 0.22 - 0.50 , P < 0.001 , I 2 = 68 % ) as compared to st and ard medical therapy  .  Surrogate outcomes showed a similar benefit favoring  CA  . Conclusion and Relevance  Catheter ablation for AF  in HFrEF is associated with improvement in  patient-centered outcomes  and surrogate outcomes when compared to  st and ard medical therapy  with or without device therapy."
"sAbstract : The 2014 United States Preventive Services Task Force systematic review found  abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) screening  decreased related mortality by close to half . Despite the simplicity of screening , research suggests poor adherence to the recommended AAA screening guidelines . Using the quality improvement plan- study -do-act cycle , we retrospectively established  poor adherence to  AAA screening  and poor documentation of smoking history in our resident clinic .  An  electronic reminder  was prospect ively implemented into our electronic medical record ( EMR ) with the goal of improving screening rates . After 1 year , a retrospective chart review was conducted . Comparisons of the pre- and post-electronic reminder intervention data were made using chi-square tests and  odds ratios (  OR ) . The  purpose ful AAA screening rate  improved 27.8 % during the intervention , 40.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 28.6–52.0 % ) versus 12.5 % ( 95 % CI : 3.1–21.9 % ) , p = .002 , suggesting patients were more likely to  be screened  as a result of the electronic reminder , OR = 4.73 ( 95 % CI : 1.77–12.65 ) . This improvement translates to a large effect size , Cohen 's d = 0.86 ( 95 % CI : 0.31–1.40 ) . Electronic reminders are a simple EMR addition that can provide evidence -based education while improving adherence rates with preventive health screening measures."
" There is weak evidence that  EIBI  may be an effective behavioral treatment for some  children with ASD ;  the strength of the evidence in this review is limited because it mostly comes from small studies that are not of the optimum design . Due to the inclusion of non-r and omized studies , there is a high risk of bias and we rated the overall quality of evidence as ' low ' or ' very low ' using the GRADE system , meaning further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate . It is important that providers of  EIBI  are aware of the current evidence and use clinical decision-making guidelines , such as seeking the family 's input and drawing upon prior clinical experience , when making recommendations to clients on the use EIBI . Additional studies using rigorous research design s are needed to make stronger conclusions about the effects of  EIBI  for children with ASD."
"nObjective : The aim of this study was to identify , retrieve , critically appraise and synthesize information regarding existing  mobile phone text messaging interventions  that have been done for secondary prevention of  cardiovascular disease ( CVD )  . Methods : A systematic review was conducted . The search ing was conducted by using the MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsychINFO , CINAHL , PubMed and ScienceDirect data bases .  Nine r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs )  were eligible and included . Results : The preventive factors measured among studies varied . While the majority of studies examined  medication adherence  as a main outcome ( 4 ) , the other 3 studies focused on  CVD risk factors combining blood pressure ( BP ) , smoking , body mass index ( BMI ) , physical activity and dietary habits  , only 2 studies examined both  medication adherence and risk factor modification of CVD .  Conclusion : Even though  mobile phone text  messaging may be beneficial for the secondary prevention of CVD , reliable conclusions on the effects of text messaging can not be drawn."

"DAbstract To estimate the associations between  vitamin D  status and  Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) .  We search ed electronic data bases of the human literature in PubMed , EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to February , 2014 using the following keywords :  ‘ vitamin D ’ or ‘ 25(OH)D ’  and ‘ status ’ or ‘ deficiency ’ or ‘ insufficiency ’ and ‘ Parkinson ’s disease ’ . A systematic  review  and meta- analysis were conducted on observational studies that reported the association between  blood vitamin D levels  and PD .  Seven studies met the inclusion criteria . 1,008 patients and 4,536 controls were included .  Results of our meta- analysis show that  PD  patients had  lower mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ]  than healthy controls [ weighted mean difference ( MD ) , −16.9 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ] , −33.5 to −0.2 ) . Patients with vitamin D insufficiency [ 25(OH)D level < 75 nmol/l ] had an  increased risk of PD  ( OR 1.5 , 95 % CI 1.1–2.0 ) . Patients with vitamin D deficiency [ 25(OH)D level < 50 nmol/l ] experienced a  twofold increased risk of PD  ( OR 2.2 , 95 % CI 1.5–3.4 ) .  Low vitamin D levels  are associated with  an increased risk of  PD."
">The serious health , social and economic consequences of falls are well documented . Lower extremity muscle weakness and power as well as balance impairment are major independent intrinsic contributors to falls and amenable to intervention .  Progressive resistance training ( PRT )  is widely accepted as an appropriate modality for treating sarcopenia and has been reported to improve  balance .  However , other studies affirm no significant effect of PRT on  balance  . To date , there is no clear , definitive statement or synthesis of studies that has examined the effect of PRT on balance . Therefore , our objective was to systematic ally review the literature to probe the merit of PRT as a single intervention on  balance  performance in  older adults .  We conducted a comprehensive search of major electronic data bases to October 2006 , with citation search es and bibliographic search es of journal articles and literature / systematic review s. Two independent review ers screened for eligibility and assessed the quality of the studies using the Physiotherapy Evidence Data base scale for validity assessment . R and omized controlled trials of  PRT  only , with any balance outcome in  participants with a mean age of ≥60 years ( individual minimum age > 50 years )  were included . Trials that contained more than one intervention , providing the  PRT  and  control  groups matched the inclusion criteria , were also included . Because of the heterogeneity of interventions and balance outcomes , a meta- analysis was not performed . However , corrected effect sizes with confidence intervals were determined for each study outcome .  Twenty-nine studies were compatible with the inclusion /exclusion criteria and were eligible for review . Participants ( n = 2174 ) included healthy , community-dwelling , mobility-limited , frail cohorts and those with chronic comorbidities .   Balance  outcomes conducted were extensive and were broadly categorized by the authors  as : static , dynamic , functional and computerized dynamic posturography  . Some studies used more than one  balance  outcome .  The number of balance tests  in all totalled 68 . Fourteen studies ( 15 tests representing 22 % of all balance tests ) reported improvements , significantly greater than controls ,  in balance performance  following PRT . Improvements were not linked to a  particular type of balance performance  . The inconsistent effect of PRT on balance may be explained by heterogeneity of cohort and balance tests , variability in methodology of the balance test and sample size , inadequate dose of PRT and /or compliance to training , or lack of statistical power . St and ardization of balance testing methodology and better reporting of procedures may ensure greater comparability of results in future studies . It is also possible that PRT alone is not a robust intervention for balance control . This is the first systematic synthesis of the literature to examine the effectiveness of  PRT  alone on  balance performance  in  older adults .  The limited evidence presented in currently published data has not consistently shown that the use of  PRT  in isolation improves  balance  in this population . However , further research should explore optimal  resistance training  regimens that : focus on the muscles most pertinent to balance control , best target neuromuscular adaptations that protect against postural challenges and eluci date mechanism(s ) by which  PRT  may affect  balance control ."

" When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and  individual  lifestyle  interventions  that include  diet and physical activity  generally prove to be effective in  reducing weight .  Physical screening and monitoring programmes are well accepted by patients and can be implemented in a variety of setting s. A  weight loss  of 0.98 points  in the Body Mass Index  corresponds to a loss of 3.12 % of the initial weight . This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to  improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia  . However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone . Therefore , in addition to weight reduction , the assessment of metabolic parameters to monitor other independent risk factors should also be integrated into physical health promotion and management in people with  mental  disorders."
"tPurpose To identify   vision Patient-Reported Outcomes  instruments relevant to glaucoma  and assess their content validity . Methods MEDLINE , MEDLINE in Process , EMBASE and SCOPUS ( to January 2009 ) were systematic ally search ed . Observational studies or r and  omised  controlled trials ,  published in English  ,  reporting use of vision instruments in glaucoma studies involving adults  were included . In addition , reference lists were scanned to identify additional studies describing development and /or validation to ascertain the final version of the instruments . Instruments ’ content was then mapped onto a theoretical framework , the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health . Two review ers independently evaluated studies for inclusion and quality assessed instrument content . Results  Thirty-three instruments were identified .  Instruments were categorised into thirteen vision status , two vision disability , one vision satisfaction , five glaucoma status , one glaucoma medication related to  health  status , five glaucoma medication side effects and six glaucoma medication satisfaction measures according to each instruments ’ content . The  National Eye Institute Visual Function Question naire-25 , Impact of Vision Impairment and Treatment Satisfaction Survey-Intraocular Pressure  had the highest number of positive ratings in the content validity assessment . Conclusion This study provides a descriptive catalogue of vision-specific PRO instruments , to inform the choice of an appropriate measure of patient-reported outcomes in a glaucoma context."

"nResearch has shown that  people who have rheumatoid arthritis ( RA )  do not usually participate in enough physical activity to obtain the benefits of optimal physical activity levels , including quality of life , aerobic fitness and disease-related characteristics . Behaviour change theory underpins the promotion of physical activity . The aim of this systematic review was to explore  behaviour change interventions  which targeted physical activity behaviour in  people who have RA  , focusing on the theory underpinning the interventions and the behaviour change techniques utilised using specific behaviour change taxonomy . An electronic data base search was conducted via EBSCOhost , PubMed , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science data bases in August 2014 , using Medical Subject Headings and keywords . A manual search of reference lists was also conducted . R and omised control trials which used  behaviour change techniques  and targeted physical activity behaviour in  adults who have RA  were included . Two review ers independently screened studies for inclusion . Method ological quality was assessed using the Cochrane  risk of  bias  tool  .  Five studies with 784 participants were  included in the review . Method ological quality of the studies was mixed . The studies consisted of  behaviour change interventions  or  combined practical physical activity and behaviour change interventions  and utilised a large variety of  behaviour change techniques .  Four studies reported increased  physical activity behaviour .  All studies used  subjective methods  of  assessing physical activity  with only one study utilising an objective measure . There has been varied success of  behaviour change interventions  in promoting  physical activity behaviour  in  people who have RA .  Further studies are required to develop and implement the  optimal behaviour change  intervention in this population."
"eOBJECTIVE To describe the   pain  decrease  considered as  clinical  ly relevant when design ing a trial and reporting its results . METHODS A systematic review of the literature in MEDLINE was conducted to  select r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) with pain as a primary  outcome . Data extracted included the definition ( terms and values ) of a clinical ly relevant difference in pain , the type  of pain  studied ( acute or chronic ) , the level of application ( group or individual ) of the clinical ly relevant difference , and the reference justifying the choice of value for clinical ly relevant difference . STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING  Seventy-four trials were included  , and only 16 articles justified the choice of a value for clinical ly relevant difference with a reference citation . The values chosen for the clinical ly relevant relative decrease in  pain  varied from 4 to 40 mm or from 15 % to 55 % at the group level and from 20 to 50 mm at the individual level . In seven articles , the authors confused the application of the reference value at the individual or group level .  Our review revealed a great heterogeneity in definition , format , and values of what is considered a clinical ly relevant difference in pain in RCTs of analgesics , and st and ardizations are advisable."

"DBackground Various clinical trials suggested that  risperidone  was beneficial in the treatment of  autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) in children and adolescents .  Objective The aim of this systematic review was to determine the  efficacy , acceptability and tolerability  of  risperidone  in the treatment of  children and adolescents with ASD .  Data sources The data bases of Scopus , PubMed , CINAHL and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were search ed in February 2017 . Study eligibility criteria participants and interventions Eligible RCTs of  risperidone  in the treatment of  child and adolescent patients with ASD .  Language s were not restricted . Study appraisal and synthesis methods The full-text versions of relevant studies were thoroughly assessed and extracted . The primary efficacy of outcome was the  pooled response rate  and  the pooled mean  changed scores of the st and ardized rating scales for ASD . Results  A total of 372 r and omized subjects from seven RCTs  were included in this review . In acute treatment , the  pooled mean change score of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist for irritability subscale ( ABC-I )  and  response rate  for the  risperidone-treated  group had a greater significance than that of the  placebo-treated  group . In the long-term treatment , the  pooled mean change score of the CARS  in the  risperidone-treated  group was significantly greater than that in the  placebo-treated  group . According to the discontinuation phase , the  overall pooled relapse rate  of the risperidone-treated group was significantly less than that of the  placebo-treated  group . The  rates of pooled overall discontinuation and discontinuation due to adverse events rates  were not different between the two groups in acute and long-term treatments . Limitations A small study was included in the current review . Conclusion In relation to the current systematic review ,  risperidone  is efficacious in the treatment of symptoms in  children and adolescents with ASD .  Although its acceptability is comparable to placebo , treatment with  risperidone  is well tolerated in children and adolescents with ASD."

"PAIMS To conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant  r and omized clinical trials (  RCTs  )  to ascertain the effect size of  orlistat  in modulating plasma levels of adipokines , ghrelin and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . METHODS Medline , SCOPUS , Web of Science and Google Scholar data bases were search ed . A r and om-effects model and the generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis . Heterogeneity was quantitatively assessed using I(2 ) index . Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the one- study remove approach . R and om-effects meta-regression was performed using unrestricted maximum likelihood method to evaluate the impact of duration of treatment , percentage change in  body mass index ( BMI )  and  baseline BMI values  as potential confounders of the estimated effect size . RESULTS Meta- analysis suggested a significant increase in  plasma levels of adiponectin  [ weighted mean difference ( WMD ) : 19.18 % , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 5.80 , 32.57 , p = 0.005 ] and significant  reductions in plasma levels of leptin  ( WMD : -13.24 % , 95 % CI : -20.69 , -5.78 , p = 0.001 ) and  CRP  ( WMD : -11.52 % , 95 % CI : -16.55 , -6.49 , p < 0.001 ) following treatment  with orlistat .  In meta-regression ,  changes in plasma concentrations of adiponectin , leptin and CRP  were associated with duration of treatment , but not with either change in BMI or baseline BMI values .   Orlistat  is effective in increasing plasma concentrations of adiponectin and decreasing those of leptin and CRP."
"ABackground  Robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty ( THA )  allows for accurate preoperative planning and component positioning , potentially enhancing implant survival and long-term outcomes . The relative efficacy and safety of  robotic-assisted and conventional THA  , however , are unclear . This systematic review and meta- analysis compared the safety and efficacy of  robotic-assisted and conventional THA .  Methods Medline , Embase and the Cochrane Library were comprehensively search ed in September 2017 to identify studies comparing the safety and efficacy of  robotic-assisted and conventional THA .   Seven studies  were included . Data of interest were extracted and analysed using Review Manager 5.3 . Results The  seven included studies involved 1516 patients , with 522 undergoing  robotic-assisted  and 994 undergoing  conventional THA .   Compared with  conventional THA , robotic-assisted THA  was associated with longer  surgical time  ( not significant ) ;  lower intraoperative complication rates  ( OR : 0.12 , 95 % CI : 0.05 to 0.34 , p<0.0001 I2 ) ;  better cup placement , stem placement and global offset and a higher rate of heterotopic ossifications . Functional scores , limb length discrepancy and rates of revision and stress shielding  were similar in the two groups . The relative amount of  blood loss  was unclear . Conclusion The results of this meta- analysis suggest that  robotic-assisted THA  has certain advantages over  conventional THA  , including the results of component positioning and  rates of intraoperative complications  . Additional comparative studies are required to determine the long-term clinical outcomes of robotic-assisted THA."

"wBackground . The goal of this systematic review is to determine the most commonly used  outcome measurement  tools used by  foot and ankle specialists  and determine their limitations , such as whether they are vali date d , have floor/ceiling effects , and so on . Methods . A literature search was conducted to identify  primary publications between January 1 , 2012 and July 1 , 2017 that concern care of the foot and ankle and use any established grading criteria to evaluate patients  . Results . In  669 publications , 76 scoring systems were  used . The 10 most common were  American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score ( AOFAS ) , visual analog scale ( VAS ) , Short Form–36 ( SF-36 ) , Foot Function Index ( FFI ) , Foot and Ankle Outcome Score ( FAOS ) , Foot and Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM ) , SF-12 , Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment ( SMFA ) , Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale ( AOS ) , and Foot and Ankle Disability Index ( FADI ) . AOFAS  was used in 393 articles ,  VAS  in 308 , and SF-36 in 133 publications .  AOFAS , VAS , and SF-36  were used to evaluate  23,352 , 20,759 , and 13,184 patients  respectively .  AOFAS and VAS  were used simultaneously in 172 publications . Conclusion . While there are many different scoring systems available for foot and ankle specialists to use to assess or demonstrate the effectiveness of treatments , the AOFAS , while it is an unvali date d scoring system , is the most commonly used scoring system in this review . Clinical Relevance . This review presents data about commonly used patient reported outcomes systems in foot and ankle surgery . Levels of Evidence : Level III : Systematic review."
"dAIM To examine current evidence on use of  active video gaming ( AVG )  to improve  motor function  in  children with movement disorders including cerebral palsy , developmental coordination disorder , and Down syndrome .  METHOD Scopus , MEDLINE , Cochrane Library , EMBASE , and CINAHL were search ed . Included papers studied the use of  AVG  for improving  movement-related outcomes  in these  population s.  Parameters studied included  health condition , strength of evidence , AVG delivery methods , capacity for individualizing play , outcomes addressed , effectiveness for achieving outcomes , and challenges/ limitations .  RESULTS The 20 extracted articles varied in quality .  Studies involved children with six different conditions using  AVG  in clinical , home , or school setting s for 49 different motor outcomes .  Dosage varied in frequency and duration .  Choice of games played  and  difficulty level  were therapist determined ( n=6 ) or child controlled ( n=14 ) . The most common study limitations were small sample sizes and difficulty individualizing treatment . All articles showed improvement in outcomes with  AVG  , although differences were not consistently significant compared with  conventional therapy .  INTERPRETATION Heterogeneity of measurement tools and target outcomes prevented meta- analysis or development of formal recommendations .  However , AVG  is feasible and shows potential for improving outcomes in this population . Additional investigations of dosing variables , utility as a home supplement to clinical care , and outcomes with larger sample sizes are merited."
"'Modafinil is a central nervous system wake promoting agent used for the treatment of excessive daytime sleeping . Its vigilance promoting properties and low abuse potential has intrigued the scientific community and has led to use it as a cognitive enhancer , before its neural functions were understood . Here , we review the effects of  modafinil  in human cognition and emotion and its specific actions on symptoms in  patients with schizophrenia  and whether these are consistently effective throughout the literature . We also performed a systematic review on the effects of  modafinil  on neurotransmitter signalling in different areas of the brain in order to better underst and the neuromechanisms of its cognitive and emotional enhancing properties . A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates  cognitive functions  , with  pro-mnemonic effects  and  problem solving improvements  .  Emotional processing  also appears to be enhanced by the drug , although to date there are only a limited number of studies . The systematic review on the neurochemical modulation of the modafinil suggests that its  mnemonic enhancing properties  might be the result of glutamatergic and dopaminergic increased neuronal activation in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex respectively . Other neurotransmitters were also activated by modafinil in various limbic brain areas , suggesting that the drug acts on these brain regions to influence  emotional responses .  These review s seek to delineate the neuronal mechanisms by which modafinil affects  cognitive and emotional function .  This article is part of a Special Issue entitled ' Cognitive Enhancers '."

"yOBJECTIVE Fatigue is an important outcome for  patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .  The purpose of this study was to identify the scales being used to measure RA fatigue , and to systematic ally examine the evidence for their validation . METHODS Articles measuring fatigue in RA were sought using the terms RA and fatigue , and RA and tiredness , plus scale , question naire , inventory , and checklist . Index articles reporting identifiable RA fatigue data were examined for the fatigue scale used . Index and validation articles for each scale were review ed for evidence supporting scale validation to measure RA fatigue using a st and ardized checklist of content , face , criterion , and construct validity , reliability , and sensitivity to change . RESULTS  A total of 61 index articles  used 23 different  fatigue  scales to measure RA fatigue on 71 occasions . Seventeen scales had either no data on validation in RA or limited evidence . Reasonable evidence of validation was identified for 6 scales , each also having some evidence of sensitivity to change : ordinal scales , the Short Form 36 vitality  subscale  , the  Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale , visual analog scales ( VAS )  , the  Profile of Mood States  , and the  RA-specific Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale ( MAF )  . However , the 4 generic scales would benefit from further validation in patients with RA , the VAS requires st and ardization , and the MAF would benefit from further sensitivity data .  It was possible to identify evidence of reasonable validation for 6 of 23 scales being used to measure RA fatigue . Research ers and clinicians should select scales to measure RA fatigue carefully."

"gAtrial  remodeling  is a term introduced in 1995 to describe alterations in atrial structure or function . Atrial  electrical remodeling  is characterized by a reduction of  refractory period  and  action potential duration  ,  dispersion  in  refractoriness  , and a reduction in  conduction velocity of impulse propagation .  Numerous animal and human studies have demonstrated that atrial electrical remodeling impairs  normal atrial conduction  and provides an environment for  ectopic and re-entrant activity  , thus creating a substrate for the initiation or maintenance of atrial fibrillation . Interestingly ,  atrial electrical remodeling  has been shown to be reversible . In this systematic review , we examine the occurrence of  reverse  atrial electrical remodeling   in various clinical setting."

"eMenopause is associated with the onset of climacteric symptoms due to low estradiol levels , which may cause insufficient maturation of the vaginal mucosa .  Vitamin D  may regulate the growth and differentiation of cells that are adversely affected due to low estradiol levels , thereby restoring vaginal health . The objective of this systematic review , the first on this subject , was to investigate the effect of  vitamin D  on the   vaginal health  of menopausal women .  PubMed , Embase , Scopus , Web of Science , and Google Scholar data bases and reference lists of h and - search ed articles were search ed for published studies  from February 2000 to November 2018 .  The selection criteria were as follows : r and omized or quasi-r and omized trials that compared the effects of  vitamin D  or related compounds ,  alone or with calcium  , on  vaginal health ( growth and differentiation of epithelial cells , dryness , acidity [ pH ] )  outcomes  in menopausal women .  The method ological quality of these studies was examined using the Cochrane tool checklist by two independent investigators , following which the data were extracted . Of six examined studies , two showed that  vitamin D  administration improved the  growth and differentiation of vaginal epithelial cells , improved vaginal pH , and decreased vaginal dryness  in  menopausal women .  Although the level of evidence for the effects of  vitamin D  on  vaginal health  is low in our study , we concluded that  vitamin D  may improve the  vaginal  health  of women  , especially during menopause."
"sAlternatives to the classical  medial parapatellar ( MPP ) approach  for total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) include the  mini-medial parapatellar ( MMPP ) , mini-subvastus ( MSV ) , mini-midvastus ( MMV ) and quadriceps-sparing ( QS ) approaches .  The best approach has been not fully clarified . The purpose of the present study was to conduct a Bayesian network meta- analysis comparing these approaches . The present analysis was carried out according to the PRISMA extension statement for reporting systematic review s incorporating network meta-analyses of healthcare interventions . The data bases search was performed in October 2019 . All  clinical  trials comparing  two or more approaches for primary TKA  were considered for inclusion . The baseline comparability was evaluated through the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) test . The statistical analysis was performed through the STATA software/MP . A Bayesian hierarchical r and om-effects model analysis was adopted in all the comparisons .  Data from 52 articles ( 4533 patients ) were collected .  The mean follow-up was 20.38 months . With regard to diagnosis , gender , age and BMI , adequate baseline comparability was detected . The  MSV  approach ranked better concerning  clinical scores ( the lowest visual analogic scale , the higher KSS and KSFS ) and functional outcomes ( the shortest straight leg raise , the greatest degree of flexion and range of motion )  . Concerning perioperative data , the  MSV  evidence d the  shortest hospital stay  , while the MPP the  shortest surgical duration  and  lowest estimated blood loss .  According to the main findings of the present study ,  the mini-subvastus approach  for total knee arthroplasty demonstrated superior overall compared to the other approaches . Orthopaedic surgeons should consider this approach in the light of the evidence and limitations of this Bayesian network meta- analysis."
"TBackground  Chronic low back pain ( CLBP )  is a persistent disabling condition with rising significant healthcare , social and economic costs . Current research supports the use of  exercise-based  treatment approaches that encourage  people with CLBP  to assume a physically active role in their recovery . While international clinical guidelines and systematic review s for CLBP support  supervised group exercise  as an attractive first-line option for treating large numbers of  CLBP patients  at low cost , barriers to their delivery include space and time restrictions in healthcare setting s and poor patient attendance . The European Clinical Guidelines have identified the need for research in the use of brief/minimal contact self-activation interventions that encourage participation in physical activity for CLBP .  Walking  may be an ideally suited form of individualized exercise prescription as it is easy to do , requires no special skills or facilities , and is achievable by virtually all ages with little risk of injury , but its effectiveness for LBP is unproven . Methods and design This study will be an assessor-blinded r and omized controlled trial that will investigate the difference in  clinical effectiveness and costs  of an  individualized walking programme and a supervised general exercise programme compared to usual physiotherapy  , which will act as the  control  group , in  people with chronic low back pain . A sample of 246 patients will be recruited in Dublin , Irel and through acute general hospital outpatient physiotherapy departments that provide treatment for people with CLBP .  Patients will be r and omly allocated to one of the three groups in a concealed manner . The main outcomes will be  functional disability , pain , quality of life , fear avoidance , back beliefs , physical activity , satisfaction and costs  , which will be evaluated at baseline , and 3 , 6 and 12 months [ follow-up by pre-paid postage ] . Qualitative telephone interviews and focus groups will be embedded in the research design to obtain feedback about participants ' experiences of the interventions and trial participation , and to inform interpretation of the quantitative data . Planned analysis will be by intention to treat ( quantitative data ) and thematic analysis ( qualitative data ) Discussion The trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a  walking programme  and a  supervised general exercise programme  compared to usual  physiotherapy  in  people with CLBP.Trial  registration Current controlled trial IS RCT."

"sHighlightsMultisensory temporal dysfunction represented by an extended temporal binding window is a common feature of ASD and SSD.Unisensory  temporal acuity  is impaired in schizophrenia but may be spared in ASD.Multisensory dysfunction is associated with incoherent perception and communicative deficit that characterize SSD and ASD . & NA ; Multisensory temporal integration could be compromised in both autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders ( SSD ) and may play an important role in perceptual and cognitive impairment in these two disorders . This review aim ed to quantitatively compare the  sensory temporal acuity  between  healthy controls and the two clinical groups ( ASD and SSD ) .   Impairment of sensory temporal integration  was robust and comparable in both  patients with SSD  ( Hedges ' g = 0.91 , 95%CI[0.62–1.19 ] ; Z = 6.21 , p < .001 )  and ASD  ( Hedges ' g = 0.85 , ( 95%CI[0.54–1.15 ] ; Z = 5.39 , p < .001 ) . By further separating studies into unisensory and multisensory ( bimodal : audiovisual ) ones , subgroup analysis indicated heterogeneous  and  unstable effects for  unisensory temporal binding  in the  ASD  group , but a more consistent and  severe impairment in multisensory temporal integration  represented by an enlarged temporal binding window in both clinical groups . Such multisensory  dysfunction  is associated with  symptoms like hallucinations and impaired social communications .  Future studies focusing on improving multisensory temporal functions may have important implication s for the amelioration of  schizophrenia and autistic  symptoms."
"IThe deficiency of  vitamin D  is prevalent all over the world . Studies have shown that  vitamin  D may play an important role in the development of obesity  .  The current study was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the association between  serum  25-(OH ) vitamin D levels   and the  risk of  obesity  in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects .  A systematic review and meta- analysis of observational studies was carried out for that purpose . We search ed the Medline , PubMed , and Embase data bases throughout all of March 2018 .  A total of fifty five observational studies for both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects were finally included in  the  meta- analysis  . The data were analyzed by comprehensive meta- analysis software version 3 and the r and om effects model was used to analyze the data . The meta- analysis showed an overall inverse relationship  between serum vitamin D status and body mass index ( BMI )  in studies of both diabetic ( r = -0.173 , 95 % = -0.241 to -0.103 , p = 0.000 ) and non-diabetic ( r = -0.152 , 95 % = -0.187 to -0.116 , p = 0.000 ) subjects . The evidence of publication bias was not found in this meta- analysis . In conclusion , the deficiency of vitamin D is associated with an  increased level of BMI  in the  studies of both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects .  Reliable evidence from well- design ed future r and omized controlled trials is required to confirm the findings from observational studies and to find out the potential regulatory effects of  vitamin D  supplementation to lower BMI."

")Background  C-reactive protein  ( CRP ) and  lipoprotein ( a  ) ( Lp[a ] ) play essential roles in cardiovascular disease incidence . This study aim ed to review the association between the intake of  conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA )  in the form of  dietary supplement  or  enriched food  with different treatment duration s and the levels of Lp(a ) and CRP in  human studies .  Methods All the articles published in Cochrane Library , ProQuest , Scopus ,  and  Google Scholar  from November 2014 to October 2015  were search ed and the clinical trials on the effects of  CLA  on Lp(a ) and CRP levels were assessed . Of  the 2249 articles initially retrieved , 21 eligible r and omized clinical trials were enrolled in this systematic review .  The  publication date s of  the  eligible articles ranged from 2005 to 2013 .  The mean difference and the st and ard deviation of  changes in CRP and Lp(a ) levels  in intervention and control groups were used as effect-size measures for meta- analysis . The obtained data from the eligible r and omized controlled trials were meta-analyzed using Stata , version 13 . Results The intake of  CLA  as a dietary supplement led to a significant increase in  CRP levels  ( st and ardized mean difference [SMD]=0.41 , 95 % CI : 0.28 to 0.54 ; P=0.001 ) . Subgroup analysis based on the duration of  CLA  consumption showed that  CLA  consumption more than 24 weeks result ed in a significant increase in the  levels of CRP  ( SMD=0.52 , 95 % CI : 0.36 to 0.68 ; P=0.001 ) and  Lp(a )  ( SMD=0.24 , 95 % CI : 0.01 to 0.47 ; P=0.04 ) . Conclusion The current systematic review and meta- analysis showed that the long-term consumption of  CLA  increases the levels of CRP and Lp(a )."
"  Interventions integrating physical activity  into organizational routine during everyday life have demonstrated modest but consistent benefits , particularly for physical activity , and these are promising avenues of investigation .

"dGovernments  of low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs )  are widely implementing  performance-based financing ( PBF )  to improve healthcare services . However , it is unclear whether  PBF  provides good value for money compared to status quo or other interventions aim ed at strengthening the  healthcare system in LMICs .  The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesize the existing literature that examines whether  PBF  represents an efficient manner of investing re sources . We considered  PBF  to be efficient when improved care quality or quantity was achieved with equal or lower costs , or alternatively , when the same quality of care was achieved using less financial re sources . A manual search of the reference lists of two recent systematic review s on economic evaluations of  PBF  was conducted to identify articles that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria . Subsequently , a search strategy was developed with the help of a librarian . The following data bases and search engines were used : PubMed , EconLit , Google Scholar and Google . Experts on economic evaluations were consulted for validation of the selected studies . A  total of seven articles from five LMICs were selected for this review  . We found the overall strength of the evidence to be weak . None of the articles were full economic evaluations ; they did not make clear connections between the  costs and effects  of  PBF .  Only one study reported using a r and omized controlled trial , but issues with the r and omization procedure were reported . Important alternative interventions to strengthen the capacities of the healthcare system have not been considered . Few studies examined the  costs and consequences of  PBF   in the long term . Important  costs and consequences  were omitted from the evaluations . Few LMICs are represented in the literature , despite wide implementation . Lastly , most articles had at least one author employed by an organization involved in the implementation of  PBF  , thereby result ing in potential conflicts of interest . Stronger empirical evidence on whether  PBF  represents good value for money in LMICs is needed."

DESIGN Systematic review with meta- analysis of r and omised trials . PARTICIPANTS  Adults with stable chronic heart failure .  INTERVENTION  Progressive resistance exercise training , alone or as an adjunct to aerobic training .  OUTCOME MEASURES  Cardiac function , exercise capacity and quality of life .  RESULTS  241 participants from eight trials  performed 2 to 6 months of  moderate-intensity resistance training  ( 50 - 75 % of 1RM ) . Most programs consisted of 5 to 6 exercises for large limb and trunk muscles with two sets of 8 to 12 repetitions , three times a week .  Resistance training  significantly increased  6-minute walk distance  ( WMD 52 m , 95 % CI 19 to 85 ) but not  peak oxygen consumption  ( WMD 1.4 ml/kg/min , 95 % CI -0.3 to 3.1 ) . When used as an adjunct to  aerobic training , resistance training  did not significantly alter  left ventricular ejection fraction  ( WMD -0.5 % , 95 % CI -4.3 to 3.3 ) ,  peak oxygen consumption  ( WMD -0.7 ml/kg/min , 95 % CI -2.3 to 1.0 ) , or  Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Question naire scores  ( WMD -0.9 , 95 % CI -5.4 to 3.7 ) , compared with  aerobic training  alone .

"gBackground Despite over 2 decades of research , the ability to prevent   work-related low back pain  (  LBP )  and  disability   remains elusive . Recent research suggests that  interventions  that are focused at the workplace and incorporate the principals of participatory ergonomics and return-to-work ( RTW ) coordination can improve  RTW  and reduce  disability  following a work-related back injury .  Workplace interventions or programs to improve  RTW   are difficult to design and implement given the various individuals and environments involved , each with their own unique circumstances . Intervention mapping provides a framework for design ing and implementing complex interventions or programs . The objective of this study is to design a  best evidence RTW program  for  occupational LBP  tailored to  the Ontario setting  using an intervention mapping approach . Methods We used a qualitative synthesis based on the intervention mapping methodology . Best evidence from systematic review s , practice guidelines and key articles on the prognosis and management of LBP and improving RTW was combined with theoretical models for managing LBP and changing behaviour . This was then systematic ally operationalized into a  RTW program  using consensus among experts and stakeholders . The RTW Program was further refined following feedback from nine focus groups with various stakeholders . Results A detailed five step RTW program was developed . The key features of the program include ; having trained personnel coordinate the RTW process , identifying and ranking  barriers  and solutions to RTW from the perspective of all important stakeholders , mediating practical solutions at the workplace and , empowering the  injured worker  in RTW decision-making . Conclusion Intervention mapping provided a useful framework to develop a comprehensive  RTW program  tailored to the Ontario setting."
"nThe prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity worldwide continues to increase , as well as diseases related to these conditions . This is attributed to an increase in energy intake and a decrease in energy expenditure . Consumption of  green tea  has been linked to a reduction in  body fat and body weight .  However , research on  green tea  has been very diverse . This review assesses the investigations that have been made with  green tea  and its  epigallocatechin gallato ( EGCG )  content , evaluating its effect on  body fat  and  body weight  in  humans .  A search was made in the PubMed  and Web  of the  Science data bases  that gave a  first total result of 424 potential articles ; 409 were excluded and 15 articles were used for this systematic review .  Research has been very varied , however , daily consumption of  green tea  with doses of  EGCG  between 100 and 460 mg/day has shown greater effectiveness on  body fat and body weight reduction  in intervention periods of 12 weeks or more . In addition , the use of caffeine doses between 80 and 300 mg/day has been shown to be an important factor for this effects , when the participants did not have a high caffeine intake ( > 300 mg/day ) prior to the intervention."

"sOBJECTIVE To examine the methods used to calculate the reported  medication initiation rates  in  secondary fracture prevention programs .  STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING A systematic review was conducted on   postfracture interventions   that aim ed to improve  osteoporosis  management in an orthopedic environment . Two authors independently review ed  eligible articles  to determine the numerator and denominator used to calculate the rates of antiresorptive medication initiation based on author reports . In interventions with numerator and denominator combinations that appeared to be comparable , we examined the inclusion and exclusion criteria to confirm comparability . RESULTS  Fifty-seven articles reporting on 64 interventions were eligible for the review .  A total of 28 different  combinations of numerators and denominators to calculate rates  were reported for medication initiation across 49 of the 64 interventions . After examining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for rates that appeared to be comparable , the highest number of interventions with a comparable rate was 3 .  Reporting processes for  antiresorptive medication initiation  outcomes in secondary fracture prevention programs used heterogeneous st and ards that prevented useful comparison of programs . Applying different numerator and denominator combinations meant that the same observed number of patients could have result ed in different reported rates . We propose st and ards for reporting  medication initiation rates  in such programs."

"sObjective : To summarize the current evidence on the effects of  preoperative exercise therapy  in  patients awaiting invasive surgery on  postoperative complication rate and length of hospital stay .   Data sources : A primary search of relevant key terms was conducted in the electronic data bases of PubMed , EMBASE , PEDro and CINAHL . Review methods : Studies were included if they were controlled trials evaluating the effects of  preoperative exercise therapy  on  postoperative complication rate and length of hospital stay .  The method ological quality of included studies was independently assessed by two review ers using the PEDro scale . Statistical pooling was performed when studies were comparable in terms of patient population and outcome measures . Results were separately described if pooling was not possible . Results :  Twelve studies of patients undergoing joint replacement , cardiac or abdominal surgery were included .  The PEDro scores ranged from 4 to 8 points .  Preoperative exercise therapy consisting of inspiratory muscle training or exercise training  prior to cardiac or abdominal surgery led to a  shorter hospital stay  and  reduced postoperative complication rates .  By contrast ,  length of hospital stay and complication rates  of  patients after joint replacement surgery  were not significantly affected by preoperative  exercise therapy  consisting of strength and /or mobility training . Conclusion :  Preoperative exercise therapy  can be effective for reducing  postoperative complication rates and length of hospital stay  after cardiac or abdominal surgery . More research on the utility of  preoperative exercise therapy  and its long-term effects is needed as well as insight in the benefits of using risk models."
" Given these evidence -based statements , the consensus panel stated that , in  patients with persistent and permanent AF undergoing cardiac surgery  ,  concomitant surgical ablation  is recommended to increase  incidence of sinus rhythm  at short- and long-term follow-up ( class 1 , level A ) ; to reduce the  risk of stroke and thromboembolic events  ( class 2a , level B ) ; to improve  EF  ( class 2a , level A ) ; and to  exercise tolerance  ( class 2a , level A ) and  long-term survival  ( class 2a , level B )."
"sAims  Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) patients  have increased  risk of stroke .  In paroxysmal AF , the combination of duration and frequency of episodes defines AF burden . In  patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices ( CIEDs )  , atrial high-rate episodes ( AHREs ) can be monitored continuously and are considered as a proxy for AF . This systematic review aims to determine the relationship between AF burden and  risk of thrombo-embolic events ( TBEs ) .  Methods and results We search ed Medline , Embase , PubMed , and Cochrane Library data bases and performed a review and meta- analysis . Eligible studies reported rhythm registration with specified AF burden and 3 months of follow-up for TBEs . Of  the 8849 identified publications , 7 met the inclusion criteria .  Of the  18 943 included patients , 215 ( 1.1 % ) patients developed a  TBE  .  We detected only studies registering AHRE with a duration over 5 min detected by CIED . In a meta- analysis , patients with an AHRE burden over 6 min had an increased  risk of TBE  when compared with patients without AHRE , but this risk did not increase for an AHRE burden over 6 h [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 1.82 vs. 1.78 ] . In a second meta- analysis , only patients with AHRE burden over 24 h had an increased  risk for stroke  ( HR 3.2 , 95 % confidence interval 1.75 - 5.86 ) , while patients with an AHRE burden shorter than 24 h did not . Conclusion Patients with an AHRE burden over 6 min have an increased  risk for stroke .  A trend in which a higher AHRE burden leads to a higher  risk for TBEs  was observed but not substantiated due to heterogeneity and low numbers."

"nObesity is associated with increased risk for  cardiovascular (  CV ) disease  ( CVD ) and CV mortality .   Bariatric surgery  has been shown to resolve or improve  CVD risk  factors , to varying degrees . The objective of this systematic review was to determine the impact of  bariatric surgery  on  CV risk factors and mortality .  A systematic review of the published research was performed to evaluate evidence regarding  CV  outcomes in  morbidly obese  bariatric patients .   Two major data bases ( PubMed and the Cochrane Library ) were search ed . The review included all original reports reporting outcomes after   bariatric surgery   , published in English , from January 1950 to July 2010 .  In total , 637 studies were identified from the initial screen .  After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria ,  52 studies involving 16,867 patients were included ( mean age 42 years , 78 % women ) .  The  baseline prevalence of  hypertension , diabetes , and dyslipidemia  was 49 % , 28 % , and 46 % , respectively .   Mean follow-up  was 34 months ( range 3 to 155 ) , and the  average excess weight loss  was 52 % ( range 16 % to 87 % ) . Most studies reported significant decreases postoperatively in the  prevalence of CV risk factors  , including  hypertension , diabetes , and dyslipidemia . Mean systolic pressure reduced  from to 139 to 124 mm Hg and diastolic pressure from 87 to 77 mm Hg .  C-reactive protein decreased  ,  endothelial function improved  , and a 40 % relative risk  reduction for 10-year coronary heart disease risk  was observed , as determined by the Framingham risk score . In conclusion , this review highlights the benefits of  bariatric surgery  in  reducing or eliminating risk factors for CVD .  It provides further evidence to support surgical treatment of obesity to achieve CVD risk reduction."
"1Background  Accelerometers  are widely used to measure  sedentary time , physical activity , physical activity energy expenditure ( PAEE ) , and sleep-related behaviors  , with the ActiGraph being the most frequently used br and by research ers . However , data collection and processing criteria have evolved in a myriad of ways out of the need to answer unique research questions ; as a result there is no consensus . Objectives The purpose of this review was to : ( 1 ) compile and classify existing studies assessing  sedentary time , physical activity , energy expenditure  , or  sleep  using the  ActiGraph GT3X/+  through data collection and processing criteria to improve data comparability and ( 2 ) review data collection and processing criteria when using  GT3X/+  and provide age-specific practical considerations based on the validation/calibration studies identified . Methods  Two independent research ers  conducted the search in PubMed and Web of Science . We included all  original studies in which  the  GT3X/+   was used in laboratory , controlled , or free-living conditions published from 1 January 2010 to the 31 December 2015 .  Results The present systematic review provides key information about the following data collection and processing criteria : placement , sampling frequency , filter , epoch length , non-wear-time , what constitutes a valid day and a valid week , cut-points for  sedentary time and physical activity intensity classification  , and algorithms to  estimate PAEE and sleep-related behaviors .  The information is organized by age group , since criteria are usually age-specific . Conclusion This review will help research ers and practitioners to make better decisions before ( i.e. , device placement and sampling frequency ) and after ( i.e. , data processing criteria ) data collection using the  GT3X/+ accelerometer  , in order to obtain more valid and comparable data .

"eABSTRACT Background : Pairwise meta-analyses have shown beneficial effects of individual  dietary approaches  on  blood pressure  but their comparative effects have not been established . Objective : Therefore we performed a systematic review of different  dietary intervention  trials and estimated the aggregate  blood pressure  effects through network meta- analysis  including hypertensive and pre-hypertensive patients .  Design : PubMed , Cochrane CENTRAL , and Google Scholar were search ed until June 2017 . The inclusion criteria were defined as follows : i ) R and omized trial with  a  dietary  approach ; ii ) hypertensive and pre-hypertensive adult patients ;  and iii ) minimum intervention period of  12  weeks . In order to determine the pooled effect of each intervention relative to each of the other intervention for  both diastolic and systolic blood pressure ( SBP and DBP )  , r and om effects network meta- analysis was performed . Results : A total of  67 trials  comparing 13 dietary  approaches ( DASH  , low-fat , moderate-carbohydrate , high-protein , low-carbohydrate , Mediterranean , Palaeolithic , vegetarian , low-GI/GL , low-sodium , Nordic , Tibetan , and control  ) enrolling 17,230 participants were included .  In the network meta- analysis , the  DASH , Mediterranean , low-carbohydrate , Palaeolithic , high-protein , low-glycaemic index , low-sodium  , and  low-fat dietary approaches  were significantly more effective in  reducing SBP  ( −8.73 to −2.32 mmHg )  and DBP  ( −4.85 to −1.27 mmHg ) compared to a  control  diet . According to the SUCRAs , the DASH diet was ranked the most effective dietary approach in  reducing SBP  ( 90 % )  and DBP  ( 91 % ) , followed by the Palaeolithic , and the low-carbohydrate diet ( ranked 3rd for SBP ) or the Mediterranean diet ( ranked 3rd for DBP ) . For most comparisons ,  the credibility of evidence  was rated very low to moderate , with the exception for the DASH vs. the low-fat dietary approach for which the  quality of  evidence was rated high . Conclusion : The present network meta- analysis suggests that the  DASH dietary approach  might be the most effective dietary measure to  reduce blood pressure  among  hypertensive and pre-hypertensive patients  based on high quality evidence."

"eThe aim of this systematic review was to collect all available r and omized controlled trials on the effect of  folate supplementation  on  folate status  and  health outcomes  within  the paediatric age group .  The method included a structured search strategy on MEDLINE , Embase and Cochrane data bases , with formal inclusion /exclusion criteria and data extraction procedure .  We included 26 studies .  We conclude that both  serum  and  erythrocyte folate values  reflect folate intake ; however , serum folate reacts more rapidly to folate intake than erythrocyte folate . As to health outcomes , we found no evidence indicating that additional intake of folate can influence  haematological parameters  in  non-anaemic paediatric patients .  We were unable to find evidence of a favourable  effect  of  folate  supplementation on the growth of infants . However , the limited data available suggest that supplementing the diet of low-birth-weight infants with  folic acid  may moderate the rapid fall of  serum and red cell folate  in the first months of life."

"sAlthough individual reports suggest that baseline morphometry or activity of transversus abdominis or lumbar multifidus predict clinical outcome of  low back pain ( LBP )  , a related systematic review is unavailable . Therefore , this review summarized evidence regarding the predictive value of these muscular characteristics . C and i date publications were identified from  6 electronic  medical data bases . After review ,  5 cohort studies  were included . Although this review intended to encompass studies using different muscle assessment methods , all included studies coincidentally used  ultrasound imaging .  No research investigated the relation between  static morphometry  and  clinical outcomes .  Evidence synthesis showed limited evidence supporting poor baseline  transversus  abdominis  contraction thickness ratio  as a treatment effect modifier favoring  motor control exercise .  Limited evidence supported that high baseline transversus abdominis lateral slide was associated with  higher pain intensity  after various  exercise interventions  at 1-year follow-up . However , there was limited evidence for the absence of relation between the  contraction thickness ratio of transversus  abdominis or anticipatory  onset  of  lateral  abdominal  muscles  at baseline and the short- or long-term LBP intensity after  exercise interventions .  There was conflicting evidence for a relation between  baseline percent thickness change of lumbar multifidus  during contraction and the  clinical outcomes  of patients after various conservative treatments . Given study heterogeneity , the small number of included studies and the inability of conventional greyscale B-mode ultrasound imaging to measure muscle activity , our findings should be interpreted with caution . Further large-scale prospect i ve studies that use appropriate technology ( ie , electromyography to assess muscle activity ) should be conducted to investigate the predictive value of morphometry or activity of these muscles with respect to LBP-related outcomes measures."
"sABSTRACT  Polyphenols  have been extensively studied for their  antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties .  Recently , their antiglycative  actions  by oxidative stress modulation have been linked to the prevention of diabetes and associated complications . This article assesses the evidence for  polyphenol interventions  on  glycohemoglobin ( HbA1c )  in  non-diabetic , pre-diabetic , and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) subjects .  A systematic review of  polyphenols '  clinical trials on HbA1c in humans was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis .  Thirty-six controlled r and omized trials with HbA1c values were included .   Polyphenols ( extracts , supplements , and foods )  were supplemented ( 28 mg to 1.5 g ) for 0.7 to 12 months .  Combining all subjects ( n = 1954 , mean baseline HbA1c = 7.03 % , 53 mmol/mol )  ,  polyphenol supplementation  significantly ( P < 0.001 )  lowered HbA1c%  by –0.53 ± 0.12 units ( –5.79 ± 0.13 mmol/mol ) . This reduction was significant ( P < 0.001 ) in  T2DM subjects  ,  specifically ( n = 1426  , mean  baseline HbA1c  =  7.44 %  , 58 mmol/mol  )  ,  with HbA1c% lowered  by –0.21 ± 0.04 units ( –2.29 ± 0.4 mmol/mol ) .  Polyphenol supplementation  had no significant effect ( P > 0.21 ) in the  non-diabetic ( n = 258 ,  mean baseline  HbA1c =  5.47  %  , 36 mmol/mol  )  and  the pre-diabetic subjects ( n = 270  , mean baseline HbA1c = 6.06 % , 43 mmol/mol ) strata : –0.39 ± 0.27 HbA1c% units ( –4.3 ± 0.3 mmol/mol ) , and –0.38 ± 0.31 units ( –4.2 ± 0.31 mmol/mol ) , respectively . In conclusion , polyphenols can successfully  reduce HbA1c  in T2DM without any intervention at glycemia , and could contribute to the prevention of diabetes complications."
"POropharyngeal  colostrum ( OC )  is a novel feeding strategy to prevent complications of prematurity . A meta- analysis was conducted to investigate whether  very low birth weight infants ( VLBWs )  can benefit from  OC .  R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) were search ed from Embase , PubMed , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the date of inception until May 2019 .  RCTs were eligible if they used  OC  therapy on VLBW infants .  The primary outcomes included  ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , late-onset sepsis , and death .  The secondary outcomes included the  time of full enteral feeding and the length of stay .   Eight RCTs involving 682 patients  ( OC  group : 332 ;  non-OC  group : 350 ) were included  in the meta- analysis . The results suggested  that OC  was associated with a significantly  reduced incidence of VAP  [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 0.39 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.17–0.88 , P = 0.02 ] and  full enteral feeding days  ( mean difference = −2.66 , 95 % CI : −4.51 to −0.80 , P = 0.005 ) , a potential significance  of NEC  ( OR = 0.51 , 95 % CI : 0.26–0.99 , P = 0.05 ) , a trend toward downregulating  mortality  ( OR = 0.60 , 95 % CI : 0.34–1.08 , P = 0.09 ) and  proven  sepsis ( OR = 0.64 , 95 % CI : 0.40–1.01 , P = 0.06 ) .  OC  could  significantly reduce the occurrence of VAP  , and consequently , its routine use should be considered for VLBWs to prevent infectious diseases .  OC   significantly reduces the occurrence of VAP and NEC  in  VLBW  infants   . OC may  reduce the incidence of VAP and NEC by increasing IgA levels  .  Early OC  therapy for mechanical ventilation of low-weight infants may prevent  the occurrence of VAP  .   OC  significantly reduces the occurrence of VAP and NEC  in  VLBW infants  .

"iPurpose To up date guideline recommendations on the role of  bone-modifying agents  in  multiple myeloma .  Methods An up date panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review by search ing PubMed and the Cochrane Library for r and omized controlled trials , systematic review s , meta-analyses , clinical practice guidelines , and observational studies . Results  Thirty-five relevant studies were  identified , and up date d evidence supports the current recommendations . Recommendations For  patients with active symptomatic multiple myeloma that requires systemic therapy with or without evidence of lytic destruction of bone or compression fracture of the spine from osteopenia on plain radiograph(s ) or other imaging studies  , intravenous administration of  pamidronate  90 mg over at least 2 hours or  zoledronic acid  4 mg over at least 15 minutes every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended .  Denosumab  has shown to be  noninferior  to  zoledronic acid  for the prevention of  skeletal-related events  and provides an alternative .  Fewer adverse events  related to  renal toxicity  have been noted with  denosumab  compared with  zoledronic acid  and may be preferred in this setting . The up date panel recommends that clinicians consider reducing the initial  pamidronate  dose in  patients with preexisting renal impairment .   Zoledronic acid  has not been studied in  patients with severe renal impairment  and is not recommended in this setting . The up date panel suggests that  bone-modifying treatment  continue for up to 2 years . Less frequent dosing has been evaluated and should be considered in patients with responsive or stable disease . Continuous use is at the discretion of the treating physician and the risk of  ongoing skeletal morbidity .  Retreatment should be initiated at the time of disease relapse . The up date panel discusses measures regarding  osteonecrosis of the jaw .

"yBACKGROUND  Atraumatic restorative treatment ( ART )  has demonstrated good longevity when used for single-surface restorations , but lower success rates are reported for  occlusoproximal surfaces .  AIM This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to verify the  pooled success rate  of   occlusoproximal ART restorations  in primary teeth  considering the outcomes :  longevity , pulp damage , or caries lesion progression .  DESIGN Literature search ing was carried out on the studies reporting clinical trials indexed in PubMed and in English language , comprising the outcomes . A meta- analysis was undertaken considering the results from review ed studies . RESULTS An initial search result ed in  126 articles , and three of them were finally selected .  The main reasons for excluding articles were the absence of control group , as amalgam  , composite  resin , or  compomer  restorations to be compared with  ART  ( h and excavation + high-viscous GIC ) . The pooled estimate ( odds ratio ; 95 % confidence interval ) for   ART  approach success  was 1.04 ( 0.65 - 1.66 ) .   Atraumatic restorative treatment restorations  performed with high-viscous GIC present similar  survival/success rates  to conventional approach using  composite resin  or amalgam for occlusoproximal restorations in primary teeth and can be suggested as a good option for occlusoproximal cavities in primary molars . In addition , further r and omized controlled clinical investigations concerning occlusoproximal restorations in primary teeth are still necessary."
"sBecause there are several ways to cement   glass-fiber posts ( GFPs )  into root canals  , there is no consensus on the best strategy to achieve high  bond strengths  . A systematic review was conducted to determine if there is difference in bond strength to dentin between  regular and self-adhesive resin cements  and to verify the influence of several variables on the retention of GFPs . This report followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses statement .  In vitro studies that  investigated the   bond strength  of GFPs luted with  self-adhesive and regular resin cements  were selected .  Search es were carried out in the PubMed and Scopus data bases . No publication year or language limit was used , and the last search was done in October 2012 . A global comparison was performed between  self-adhesive and regular resin cements .  Two subgroup analyses were performed :  1 ) Self-adhesive × Regular resin cement + Etch- and -rinse adhesive  and  2 ) Self-adhesive × Regular resin cement + Self-etch adhesive .  The analyses were carried out using fixed-effect and r and om-effects models . The results  showed heterogeneity  in all comparisons , and  higher bond strength to dentin  was identified  for self-adhesive cements .  Although the articles included in this meta- analysis showed high heterogeneity and high risk of bias , the in vitro literature seems to suggest that  use of self-adhesive resin cement  could improve the  retention of GFPs  into root canals."

"wBackground This systematic review examined the method ological quality of studies and assessed the psychometric qualities of   interview-administered  Past-week and Usual-week Physical Activity Question naires ( PAQs  )   . Pubmed and Embase were used to retrieve data sources . Methods The studies were selected using the following eligibility criteria : 1  ) psychometric properties of  PAQs  were assessed in adults ; 2  ) the  PAQs  either consisted of recall periods of  usual  7-days  ( Usual-week PAQs )  within the past 12 months or during the past  7-days ( Past-week PAQs )   ; and 3 )  PAQs were interview-administered  .  The COSMIN taxonomy was utilised to critically appraise study quality and a previously established psychometric criteria employed to evaluate the overall psychometric qualities . Results Following screening ,  42 studies were examined  to determine the   psychometric properties   of  20  PAQs   , with the majority of studies demonstrating good to excellent  ratings  for  method ological quality .  For  convergent validity  ( i.e. , the relationship between PAQs and other measures ) , similar overall associations were found between Past-week  PAQs  and Usual-week  PAQs .  However ,  PAQs  were more strongly associated with  direct measures of physical activity  ( e.g. ,  accelerometer )  than  indirect measures of physical activity  ( i.e. ,  physical fitness )  , irrespective of recall methods . Very few  psychometric properties  were examined for each  PAQ  , with the majority exhibiting poor ratings in  psychometric quality .  Only a few  interview-administered PAQs  exhibited positive ratings for a single  psychometric property  , although the other properties were either rated as poor or question able , demonstrating the limitations of current  PAQs  . Conclusion Accordingly , further research is necessary to explore a greater number of psychometric properties , or to develop new  PAQs  by addressing the psychometric limitations identified in the current review."
 Group medical  visits  should be considered by clinicians as an effective non-pharmacologic intervention that can have a positive impact on  biologic markers  such as  haemoglobin A1c and systolic blood pressure .  IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE The evidence suggests that the most powerful model of  Group medical visits ( GMV )  is when a clinician prescriber is present during or immediately after GMV sessions for medication reconciliation or individual patient needs . IMPLICATION S FOR RESEARCH Future research should include this  GMV  intervention in r and omised controlled trials across different health systems and socio-economic and ethnic groups.
"lBACKGROUND The cost of the implant as part of a  total knee arthroplasty  accounts for a substantial portion of the costs for the overall procedure :  all-polyethylene tibial components  cost considerably less than  cemented metal-backed tibial components .  We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine whether the clinical results of lower-cost  all-polyethylene tibial components  were comparable with the results of a more expensive  metal-backed tibial component .  METHODS We search ed The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , EMBASE , EBSCO CINAHL , the bibliographies of identified articles ,  orthopaedic meeting abstract s  ,  health  technology  assessment web sites  ,  and important orthopaedic journals .  This search was performed for the years 1990 to the present . No language restriction was applied . We restricted our search to Level-I studies involving  participants who received either an  all-polyethylene or a metal-backed tibial implant  .  The primary outcome measures were  durability , function , and adverse events .  Two review ers independently screened the papers for inclusion , assessed trial quality , and extracted data . Effects estimates were pooled with use of fixed and r and om-effects models of risk ratios , calculated with 95 % confidence intervals . Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic . Forest plots were also generated . RESULTS  Data on 1798 primary total knee implants from twelve studies were analyzed .  In all  studies  ,  the median or mean age of the participants was greater than sixty-seven years , with a majority of the patients being female .  There was no difference between  patients managed with an  all-polyethylene tibial component   and those  managed  with a   metal-backed tibial component   in terms of  adverse events .  There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the  durability of the implants  at two , ten , and fifteen years postoperatively , regardless of the year or how durability was defined  ( revision or radiographic failure )  . Finally , with use of a variety of vali date d measures , there was no difference between the two groups in terms of  functional status  at two , eight , and ten years , regardless of the measure used .  A less expensive  all-polyethylene component  as part of a total knee arthroplasty has results equivalent to those obtained with a  cemented metal-backed tibial component .  Using a total knee implant with a  cemented all-polyethylene tibial component  could save the healthcare system substantial money while obtaining equivalent results to more expensive cemented design s and material."
"sPURPOSE The evidence has suggested that  resveratrol  has anti-inflammatory effect ; however , the results are inconsistent and inconclusive . The aim of this study was to assess the effect of  resveratrol supplementation  on the levels of  inflammatory markers  through a systematic review and meta- analysis of available r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . METHODS A search strategy was completed using Medline , ISI Web of Science , Directory of Open Access Journal , SID , ProQuest , Cochrane Library , Scopus , and EMBASE up to May 2017 , to identify  placebo-controlled  RCTs that assessed  resveratrol  effects on circulating ( serum and plasma ) inflammatory markers ( interleukin [IL]-6 , tumor necrosis factor-α [ TNF-α ] , and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hs-CRP ] ) among  adult participants aged 17 years and older in 17 RCTs with a total of 736 subjects .  The evaluation of study quality was performed using the Jadad scale .  Weighted mean difference ( WMD )  was calculated for evaluating the changes in the inflammatory markers using fixed-effects or r and om-effects models . We performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the heterogeneity of the studies . FINDINGS  Seventeen RCTs , including 736 subjects , fulfilled  the eligibility criteria and were selected for analyses . The results of meta- analysis found significant reductions in  the level of TNF-α  ( WMD , -0.44 ; 95 % CI , -0.71 to -0.164 ; P = 0.002 ; Q statistic = 21.60 ; I2 = 49.1 % ; P =  0.02 ) and hs-CRP  ( WMD , -0.27 ; 95 % CI , -0.5 to -0.02 ; P = 0.033 ; Q statistic = 26.95 ; I2 = 51.8 % ; P = 0.013 )  after supplementation with resveratrol . Resveratrol  supplementation had no significant effect  on the level of IL-6  ( WMD , -0.16 ; 95 % CI , -0.53 to 0.20 ; P = 0.38 ; Q statistic = 36.0 ; I2 = 72.3 % ;  P  =  0.001 )  . Statistically significant heterogeneity was observed for the type of  sample in IL-6 and study duration in inflammatory markers IL-6 , TNF-α , and hs-CRP  . IMPLICATION S Available evidence from RCTs  suggests that resveratrol  supplementation  significantly reduced TNF-α and hs-CRP levels  .  Significant improvement in inflammatory markers   support resveratrol  as an adjunct to pharmacologic management of metabolic diseases."
")Antihypertensive  drugs  reduce  headache  but it is unclear whether there are differences between drug classes .  Calcium channel blockers ( CCBs )  decrease  variability in systolic blood pressure ( SBPV )  and  stroke risk  more than other classes , possibly due to decreased vascular tone . If so , there might be a correlation between drug-class effects on  variability in SBP  and  on headache .  We determined antihypertensive class effects on  SBPV and headache  during follow-up in a systematic review of r and omized controlled trials . We determined pooled estimates of treatment effect on group  variability in BP  ( variance ratio , VR ) and on the  odds ratio for headache  ( OR ) by r and om-effects meta- analysis .  Antihypertensive drugs  reduced the incidence of  headache  compared to  placebo  ( OR = 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.69–0.82 , p < 0.0001  , 198 comparisons , 43,672 patients )  , but there was significant heterogeneity between drug classes ( p = 0.0007 ) with a greater effect of beta-blockers compared to placebo ( VR = 0.49 , 0.33–0.68 , p < 0.0001 , 16 trials ) or all other drug classes ( OR = 0.73 , 0.62–0.85 , p = 0.0002 , 49 trials ) and a lack of  effectiveness  of CCBs ( vs. placebo-OR = 0.95 , 0.79–1.15 , 65 trials ; vs. other drugs-OR = 1.19 , 1.05–1.35 , p = 0.009 , 101 trials ) . Drug-class effects on  headache  were opposite to effects on  variability in SBP  ( vs. other drugs : CCB-VR = 0.81 , 0.71–0.85 , p < 0.0001 ; beta-blocker VR = 1.17 , 1.07–1.28 , p < 0.0001 ) , but were unrelated to differences in  mean SBP .   Antihypertensive drugs  reduce  headache  but the effect differs between classes , corresponding to their effects on  SBPV and the risk of stroke .  This may partly be explained by consistent antihypertensive class effects on  vascular  tone in the peripheral ( variability ) and cerebrovascular circulations ( headache )."

"yBACKGROUND A  geriatric assessment ( GA )  is increasingly used to help guide treatment decisions in  older patients with cancer .  However , there is no consensus regarding which domains should be included in the  GA .  In addition , the field of geriatric oncology moves very fast and as a result many new studies have been published since the last review in 2015 . Therefore , the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate which domains of the  GA  could predict patient-related treatment outcomes of  older patients with cancer  and thereby should be included in a  GA .  METHODS A systematic literature search was performed for  publications in English or Dutch between September 2006 and July 2017  addressing the association between individual domains of the  GA  and   mortality ,  postoperative  complications , or systemic treatment-related outcomes  in older patients with cancer .  RESULTS Eight different domains were evaluated in 46 publications , namely  functional status , nutritional status , cognition , mood , physical function , fatigue , social support , and falls .  All eight domains were predictive for at least one of the investigated outcomes but the results were quite variable across studies .  Physical function and nutritional status  were the domains most often associated with  mortality  and systemic treatment-related outcomes , and the domain  physical function  was most often associated with  postoperative complications  .  Overall , this review demonstrates that  the GA  should minimally consist of physical function and nutritional status , when the aim is to predict patients -related outcomes of  older patients with cancer  , although the results are quite heterogeneous . For the other domains , the findings are too inconsistent to draw conclusions about their overall predictive ability."
" Hernia repair elicits a systemic inflammatory response characterized by an increase  in CRP , IL-6 , leukocytes , neutrophils , IL-1 , IL-10 , fibrinogen , and α1-antitrypsin  and  a decrease in lymphocytes and albumin .  A higher inflammatory response was found  after mesh repair  compared with  non-mesh repair  and  after open mesh repair  compared with laparoscopic mesh repair."
"sABSTRACT Objective : To provide clinicians and research ers information regarding ( 1 ) the existing outcome measures to assess the loss of functionality in the activities of daily living ( ADLs ) of  patients with stroke  and ( 2 ) the presence of these  assessment tools  in the  Italian context .  Study Design and Setting : For this Systematic Review Medline , CINAHL , and PsycINFO were search ed for articles published up to 4 July 2017 . Two authors independently identified eligible studies on the basis of predeﬁned inclusion criteria and extracted data .  Study quality and risk of bias  were assessed using the Quality  Assessment  Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies . Results : Of  370 publications identified and screened  ,  46 studies fell  within the  inclusion  criteria and were critically review ed . The most commonly used tools were  : the Frenchay Activities Index and the Functional Independence Measure  . Conclusion : This review has emphasized the need for agreement among research ers as to which tool must be studied in depth or adapted to other national context s in order to develop universal norms and st and ards."
"eEnhanced  recovery programs ( ERPs )  have been shown to improve postoperative outcomes  after abdominal surgery .  This study aim ed to review the current literature to assess if  ERPs  in colorectal , pancreas , and liver surgery induce  cost savings .  A systematic review was performed including prospect i ve and retrospective studies comparing  conventional management versus ERP  in terms of costs . All kinds of  ERP  were considered ( fast-track , ERAS ® , or home-made protocol s ) . Studies with no mention of a clear protocol and no reporting of protocol compliance were excluded .  Thirty-seven articles out of 144 identified records were scrutinized as full articles  . Final analysis included 16 studies . In colorectal surgery , two studies were prospect i ve ( 1 r and omized controlled trial , RCT ) and six retrospective , totaling  1277  non-ERP  patients and 2078  ERP  patients .  Three of the eight studies showed no difference  in cost savings  between the two groups . The meta- analysis found  a mean cost reduction  of USD3010 ( 95 % CI : 5370–650 , p = 0.01 ) in favor of  ERP  . Among the five included studies in pancreas surgery ( all retrospective , 552  non-ERP  vs. 348  ERP  patients ) ,  the mean cost reduction  in favor of the  ERP  group was USD7020 ( 95 % CI : 11,600–2430 , p = 0.003 ) . In liver surgery , only three studies ( two retrospective and 1 RCT , 180  non-ERP  vs. 197  ERP  patients ) were found , which precluded a sound cost analysis . The present systematic review suggests  that ERPs  in colorectal and pancreas surgery are  associated with cost savings  compared to conventional perioperative management  . Cost data  in liver surgery are scarce."
"sEpidemiological data have demonstrated an association between  artificial sweetener  use and   weight gain .   Evidence of a causal relationship linking  artificial sweetener  use to  weight gain  and other  metabolic health effects  is limited . However , recent animal studies provide intriguing information that supports an active metabolic role of  artificial sweeteners .  This systematic review examines the current literature on   artificial sweetener consumption  in children and its health effects . Eighteen studies were identified .  Data from large , epidemiologic studies support the existence of an association between   artificially-sweetened  beverage   consumption and  weight gain  in children .  R and omized controlled trials in  children  are very limited , and do not clearly demonstrate either beneficial or adverse metabolic effects of  artificial sweeteners .  Presently , there is no strong clinical evidence for causality regarding  artificial sweetener  use and  metabolic health effects  , but it is important to examine possible contributions of these common food additives to the global rise in pediatric obesity and diabetes."
"wIntroduction :  Meibomian Gl and Dysfunction ( MGD  ) is a common , often overlooked , chronic condition affecting eyes for which various therapies are being evaluated . Considering the absence of a systematic review and meta- analysis , the present review was carried out . Methods : An appropriate search strategy eligibility criteria were framed and electronic data bases were scrutinized for appropriate literature . R  and  omized Controlled  Trials ( RCTs ) enrolling patients diagnosed with MGD  were included . Outcome measures were  Tear Break Up Time ( TBUT ) , Schirmer ’s test , Meibomian Gl and ( MG ) secretion score , MG plugging score , OSDI and SPEED .  Cochrane ’s tool was used to assess the risk of bias and Forest plot were generated either with fixed or r and om effects model , with St and ardized Mean Difference ( SMD ) . Results :  TBUTs , Schirmer ’s test and OSDI scores  for systemic antimicrobials with placebo were 1.58 [ 1.33 , 1.83 ] , 2.93 [ 0.78 , 5.09 ] and -3.58 [ -4.28 , -2.89 ] respectively . No quantitative synthesis was attempted for either mebiomian plugging or meibomian  secretion  scores and no significant changes were observed with any other outcome parameter . Conclusion : Only the systemic antimicrobials were found to improve the clinical features of meibomian gl and dysfunction . Varying effects of different therapeutic agents ( heat therapies , omega-3-fatty acids and castor oil ) were identified for MGD but the risk of bias pertaining to r and omization and allocation concealment was found to be associated with most of the current RCTs . More high quality evidence is required to confirm the findings of the present review."
"hWe performed a systematic review of the available evidence on the relationship between the individual clinical , echocardiographic and laboratory characteristics of  patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF )  and the risk of  stroke .  A systematic review was also performed of all published stroke risk stratification models , as well as the accuracy of their discriminative ability between risk strata . Third , we review ed the literature on  cost-effectiveness analyses  with  oral anticoagulation in  AF . From the systematic review on stroke risk factors , a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack ( 15/16 studies positive , risk ratio [ RR ] 2.86 ) , hypertension ( 11/20 studies positive , RR 2.27 ) , aging ( 9/13 studies positive , RR 1.46 per decade increase ) , structural heart disease ( 9/13 studies positive , RR 2.0 ) and diabetes ( 9/14 studies positive , RR 1.62 ) were found to be good independent predictors of  stroke .  Supportive evidence was found for sex ( 8/22 studies positive , RR 1.67 ) , vascular disease ( 6/17 studies positive , RR 2.61 ) and heart failure ( 7/18 studies positive , RR 1.85 ) . The various risk stratification schemes classified variable proportions as low , moderate and high risk , but the  CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score  classified the smallest proportion of patients as ' low risk ' .  Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists and dabigatran  is  cost-effective  in patients at high risk of stroke , but not in patients without any other stroke risk factor beside AF . Continued efforts are warranted to improve the  antithrombotic  management of  AF patients  to identify , and challenge , risk factors and refine risk stratification models in order to realize an individualized tailored , risk factor-based approach."
"sOBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of  home-based supervised exercise vs hospital-based supervised exercise  , and the effects of  home-based supervised exercise vs unsupervised "" go home and walk advice ""  on  daily life and corridor-walking capacity , health-related quality of life  and  patient-reported functional walking capacity  in  patients with intermittent claudication .  DATA SOURCES Systematic literature search es were conducted in PubMed , EMBASE , ProQuest , the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) , the Allied and Complementary Medicine Data base ( AMED ) , the Cochrane Library , and a number of Health Technology Assessment (HTA)- data bases in October 2014 . STUDY SELECTION  R and omized controlled trials and non-r and omized controlled trials ( > 100 patients )  were considered for inclusion . DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently and discussed in meetings . DATA SYNTHESIS  Seven  r and omized controlled trials and 2 non-r and omized controlled studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria . The included studies had some , or major , limitations .  Based on a low quality of evidence ,  home-based supervised exercise  may lead to less improvement in  maximum and pain-free walking distance  , and in more improvement in  daily life walking capacity  , compared with  hospital-based supervised exercise . Home-based supervised exercise  may improve  maximum and pain-free walking distance  compared with  ""  go home and walk advice "" and result in little or no difference in  health-related quality of life and functional walking capacity  compared with  hospital-based supervised exercise  or  "" go home and walk  advice "" . Further research is needed to establish the optimal exercise modality for these patients."
"tAIM The first aim of this study was to systematic ally review and critically assess  manually controlled instrumented  spasticity  assessment methods  that combine multidimensional signals . The second aim was to extract a set of quantified parameters that are psychometrically sound to assess spasticity in a clinical setting . METHOD Electronic data bases were search ed to identify studies that assessed spasticity by simultaneously  collecting electrophysiological and biomechanical signals during manually controlled passive muscle stretches .  Two independent review ers critically assessed the method ological quality of the psychometric properties of the included studies using the COSMIN guidelines . RESULTS  Fifteen studies with instrumented spasticity assessment s met all inclusion criteria .  Parameters that integrated electrophysiological signals with joint movement characteristics were best able to quantify spasticity . There were conflicting results regarding biomechanical-based parameters that quantify the resistance to passive stretch . Few methods have been assessed for all  psychometric properties  . In particular , further information on absolute reliability and responsiveness for more muscles is needed . INTERPRETATION Further research is required to determine the correct parameters for quantifying spasticity based on integration of signals , which especially focuses on distinguishing the neural from non-neural contributions to increased joint torque . These parameters should undergo more rigorous exploration to establish their psychometric properties for use in a clinical environment."
" At present , it is unclear whether the significant improvements shown in radiological outcomes after  CNTKA  translate to measurable clinical benefits . Although an assumption could be made that an improvement in post-operative alignment should lead to an improvement in patient-related outcomes , the available literature did not clearly show this . Further , long-term trials are required to address this issue."
"sThe burden of  atrial fibrillation ( AF )  on Western  countries  healthcare systems is steadily increasing , with > 2 million Americans and 4 million Europeans affected by this condition . It is by far the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice , with a striking impact on  morbidity  and  mortality .  With these premises , achieving a definite cure is highly desirable , as this would have profound social and economic implication . In  patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF ( PAF )  , multiple clinical trials have established the superiority of  catheter ablation ( CA )  over  further antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD ) therapy  for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm , to improve  quality of life  , and reduce  hospitalizations .  Whether  CA  should be adopted as a first-line therapy is still a matter of controversy . Approximately 8 years ago , Verma and Natale released an article in Circulation defending the thesis that  CA  should be adopted as a first-line therapy for AF ; in their support , they referenced the results of a pivotal r and omized trial by the same authors ( ie ,  Radiofrequency Ablation  versus  Antiarrhythmic drugs  as First-line Treatment of symptomatic atrial fibrillation [ RAAFT ] ) , together with additional considerations such as the  mortality benefit of sinus rhythm maintenance  , the  ineffectiveness of  AAD   for the  rhythm control of AF  , and the significant risks associated with  AAD  therapy . In an antagonist article , Padanilam and Prystowsky defended the role of  AAD  , given the insufficient evidence supporting  CA  as a first-line therapy , together with the lack of knowledge on the  long-term efficacy and risks  of   CA   , the  cost-effectiveness  of this strategy , and the reproducibility of the results across different institutions and operators . Today , we think that sufficient evidence has been acquired . In the present article , we adopted a systematic review method to summarize the available evidence and give an opinion on the role of  CA  as a first-line therapy for PAF . Such an approach has been preferred to the more classical narrative review , to minimize the risk of subjective statements and base the conclusions on quantitative numbers rather than personal opinions."
" There is evidence that  statin  therapy in  patients  with a history  of  ischaemic stroke  or  TIA significantly reduces  subsequent major coronary events  but only marginally reduces the  risk of stroke recurrence .  There is no clear evidence of beneficial effect from  statins  in those with previous haemorrhagic stroke and it is unclear whether  statins  should be started immediately post stroke or later . In view of this and the evidence of the benefit of  statin therapy  in those with a history of CHD , patients with  ischaemic stroke or  TIA , with or without a history of established CHD , should receive statins."
"dBackground The  ActivityStat  hypothesis suggests that when physical activity is increased or decreased in one domain , there will be a compensatory change in another domain , in order to maintain an overall stable level of physical activity or energy expenditure over time . The ActivityStat debate is gaining momentum in the literature and most of the research to date is based on observational studies . Objective The objective of this paper is to conceptually clarify the  ActivityStat  hypothesis and to examine the experimental research aim ing to demonstrate or refute compensation using a systematic review process . Methods A systematic review was conducted using electronic data base search es with the aim of detecting studies experimentally investigating the ActivityStat hypothesis or compensation in physical activity or energy expenditure . Included studies were critically appraised using a specifically design ed tool to address the conceptual considerations of the  ActivityStat  hypothesis . Results Search es identified  28 studies that met the inclusion criteria .  Publications spanned 26 years and had multiple method ological approaches , including r and omized and non-r and omized controlled trials , crossover design s , cluster r and omized controlled trials and pre-post trials .  Population s of the included studies ranged from children , to adults and the elderly , across a range of weight statuses and used both  aerobic , resistance and mixed-exercise interventions .   The timeframe of interventions ranged from 1 day to 4 years and outcomes were measured using   doubly labelled water  , accelerometry , heart rate monitoring , resting metabolic rate , indirect calorimetry , pedometry , subjective recall question naire and the activity-related time index .  Fifteen of 28 included studies provided evidence of  compensation  , while 13 did not . Subgroup analyses by population , type and duration of intervention , weight status and study quality also showed mixed findings . Conclusion There is a substantial body of experimental literature investigating compensation that has largely been overlooked in the ActivityStat debate . However , this evidence is currently inconclusive and lacks a cohesive approach to the question of an ActivityStat . Recommendations for the design of future experimental research investigating the  ActivityStat hypothesis  are presented."
" Evidence suggests that  systematic screening and opportunistic screening  for AF increase the  rate of detection of new cases  compared with routine practice . Although these approaches have comparable effects on the  overall AF diagnosis rate  , the cost of  systematic screening  is significantly greater than the cost of  opportunistic screening  from the perspective of the health service provider . Few studies have investigated effects of screening in other health systems and in younger  age groups  ; therefore , caution needs to be exercised in relation to transferability of these results beyond the setting and population in which the included study was conducted . Additional research is needed to examine the effectiveness of alternative screening strategies and to investigate the effects of the intervention on risk of stroke for screened versus non-screened population."

"IA  preoperative  surgical  risk analysis  is necessary and important for  predicting clinical and surgical outcomes  in a clinical setting . Various tools for evaluating the patient characteristics in order to forecast perioperative clinical outcomes have previously been described ; however , an objective and precise preoperative risk assessment has not yet been established . In the last decade , the concept of frailty , which is a geriatric assessment that identifies disabilities and weaknesses in patients , has been used in order to predict clinical mortality and morbidity following invasive surgical interventions because the prevalence  of elderly patients among those undergoing surgical interventions  is increasing . Since there is currently no single generally accepted clinical definition of frailty , many clinical modalities are needed to evaluate the patients ’  geriatric activity of daily living .  Quantifying the  quality of frailty  is an evolving challenge for predicting surgical risks preoperatively . In recent years , with the development of  transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI )  , this newly definitive preoperative surgical risk assessment tool , frailty , has become more important and is attracting interest in cardiothoracic surgical setting s. Thus , this review summarized current consideration on the  preoperative risk analysis  by frailty as well as future perspectives and the potential of an ideal frailty risk assessment in cardiothoracic surgery , including the management of  elderly patients and high-risk aortic valve stenosis  by TAVI."
"aOBJECTIVE The objective of this review was to systematic ally analyze the trials on the effectiveness of  perioperative warming  in  surgical patients .  METHODS A systematic review of the literature was undertaken . Clinical trials on  perioperative warming  were selected according to specific criteria and analyzed to generate summative data expressed as st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) . RESULTS  Twenty-five studies encompassing 3,599 patients in various surgical disciplines were retrieved from the electronic data bases . Nineteen r and omized trials on 1785 patients qualified for this review .  The no-warming group developed statistically  significant hypothermia .  In the fixed effect model , the warming group had significantly  less pain and lower incidence of wound infection  , compared with the no-warming group . In the r and om effect model , the warming group was also associated with lower  risk of post-anesthetic shivering .  Both in the r and om and the fixed effect models , the warming group was associated with significantly less  blood loss .  However , there was significant heterogeneity among the trials .   Perioperative warming  of surgical patients is effective in reducing  postoperative wound pain , wound infection and shivering .  Systemic  warming  of the surgical patient is also associated with less  perioperative blood loss  through preventing hypothermia-induced coagulopathy .  Perioperative warming  may be given routinely to all patients of various surgical disciplines in order to counteract the consequences of hypothermia."
" Low- quality evidence shows a possible superiority of  benzodiazepine  over  placebo  in the short-term treatment of  panic disorders  . The validity of the included studies is question able due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments , high dropout rates , and probable publication bias . Moreover , the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the  risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms  . Due to these limitations , our results regarding the efficacy of  benzodiazepines  versus  placebo  provide only limited guidance for clinical practice . Furthermore , the clinician 's choice is not between  benzodiazepines  and  placebo  , but between  benzodiazepines  and other agents , notably SSRIs , both in terms of  efficacy and adverse effects .  The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient 's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective."
"OBackground Falling is the most common accident of daily living and the second most prevalent cause of accidental death in the world . The complex nature of risk factors associated with falling makes those at risk amongst the  elderly population  difficult to identify . Commonly used clinical tests have limitations when it comes to reliably detecting the  risk of falling  , but existing laboratory tests , such as force platform measurements , represent one method of overcoming this lack of a test . Despite their widespread use , however ,  Center of Pressure ( COP ) signal analysis  techniques vary and there is currently no consensus on which features should be used diagnostically . Our objective is to identify , through a systematic review and meta- analysis ,  the COP characteristics  of  older adults ( ≥ 60 years old ) during  quiet bipedal stance   which will allow fallers to be distinguished from non-fallers . Methods The systematic review will include both prospect i ve and retrospective articles . Five data bases will be search ed : PubMed , Cochrane CENTRAL , EMBASE , and ScienceDirect . In addition , a search of gray literature will be performed using Google Scholar and Clinical Trials.gov . Search es will be circumscribed to include  only older adults ( aged over 60 years ) who  underwent a bipedal quiet st and ing measure of their balance  and for whom the number  of falls  was reported .  Two authors will independently assess the risk of bias for each included article using a 26-item checklist . Funnel plots will be drawn to attest of possible publication biases for each COP parameters . The results will be synthesized descriptively and a meta- analysis will be undertaken . When trial method ological heterogeneity is too great for pooling of the data into a meta- analysis , evidence strength will be evaluated using best evidence analysis . Discussion Despite the numerous advantages of posturography , the diversity of studies exploring balance in  older fallers  has led to uncertainty regarding the method ’s ability to reliably identify  fall-prone older adults .  It is expected that the findings from this systematic review will help clinicians  use bipedal quiet st and ing measures  as a diagnostic test and allow research ers to explore COP characteristics to create better models for fall prevention care .

"eOBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized trials that assessed the effect of  testosterone use  on   cardiovascular events and risk factors  in men with different degrees of and rogen deficiency .  METHODS Librarian- design ed search strategies were used to search the  MEDLINE ( 1966 to October 2004 ) , EMBASE ( 1988 to October 2004 ) , and Cochrane CENTRAL ( inception to October 2004 ) data bases  . The data base search was performed again in March 2005 . We also review ed reference lists from included studies and content expert files . Eligible studies were  r and omized trials  that compared any formulation of commercially available  testosterone with placebo  and that assessed  cardiovascular risk factors ( lipid fractions , blood pressure , blood glucose ) , cardiovascular events ( cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infa rct ion , angina or claudication , revascularization , stroke ) , and cardiovascular surrogate end points ( ie  ,  laboratory tests  indicative of  cardiac or vascular disease ) .  Using a st and ardized data extraction form , we collected data on participants ,  testosterone  administration , and outcome measures . We assessed study quality with attention to allocation concealment , blinding , and loss to follow-up . RESULTS  The 30 trials included 1642 men , 808 of whom were treated with  testosterone .   Overall , the trials had limited reporting of method ological features that prevent biased results ( only 6 trials reported allocation concealment ) , enrolled few patients , and were of brief duration ( only 4 trials followed up patients for > 1 year ) . The median  loss to follow-up  across all 30 trials was 9 % .  Testosterone  use in  men with low testosterone  levels led to inconsequential changes in  blood pressure and glycemia and in all lipid fractions ( total cholesterol :  odds ratio [ OR ] , -0.22 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -0.71 to 0.27 ;  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol :  OR , -0.04 ; 95 % CI , -0.39 to 0.30 ;  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol :  OR , 0.06 ; 95 % CI , -0.30 to 0.42 ; and  triglycerides :  OR , -0.27 ; 95 % CI , -0.61 to 0.08 ) ; results were similar in patients with low-normal to normal testosterone levels . The  OR between  testosterone  use and any cardiovascular event  pooled across trials that reported these events ( n = 6 ) was 1.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.78 to 4.23 ) . Several trials failed to report data on measured outcomes . For reasons we could not explain statistically , the results were inconsistent across trials .  Currently available evidence weakly supports the inference that  testosterone  use in men is not associated with important  cardiovascular effects .  Patients and clinicians need large r and omized trials of  men  at  risk  for cardiovascular disease to better inform the safety of long-term  testosterone  use."
" There has been a substantial increase in the number of RCTs evaluating early interventions in ASD . However , few studies , only 12.5 % of the total , were rated as being at low risk of bias . Small sample size , unclear concealment of allocation and lack of clarity in the identification of the active ingredients in a diverse range of differently named treatment models were identified as challenges to the design , conduct and interpretation of studies . Improved co-ordination and design of studies is , therefore , required if future research in the field is to more clearly investigate the effects of early intervention for ASD."

"IAims The incidence of new-onset  conduction abnormalities  requiring  permanent pacemaker implantation  ( PPI )  after  transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI )  with new-generation prostheses  remains debated . This systematic review analyses the incidence of PPI  after  TAVI   with  new-generation devices  and evaluates the electrical , anatomical , and procedural factors associated with PPI . In addition , the incidence of PPI after   TAVI  with early generation prostheses  was review ed for comparison . Methods and results According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses checklist , this systematic review screened  original articles published between October 2010 and October 2017  , reporting on the incidence of PPI  after implantation of early and  new-generation TAVI prostheses .   Of the  1406 original articles identified in the first search for new-generation  TAVI  devices , 348 articles were examined for full text , and finally , 40 studies ( n = 17 139 ) were included .  The  incidence  of  a PPI  after the use of a  new-generation TAVI prosthesis  ranged between 2.3 % and 36.1 % . For balloon-exp and able prostheses , the  PPI rate  remained low when using an early generation SAPIEN device ( ranging between 2.3 % and 28.2 % ) , and with the new-generation SAPIEN 3 device , the  PPI rate  was between 4.0 % and 24.0 % . For self-exp and able prostheses , the  PPI rates  were higher with the early generation CoreValve device ( 16.3 - 37.7 % ) , and despite a reduction in  PPI rates  with the new Evolut R , the rates remained relatively higher ( 14.7 - 26.7 % ) . When dividing the studies according to the highest ( > 26.0 % ) and the lowest ( < 12.1 % ) quintile of  PPI rate  , patients within the highest quintile were more frequently  women  when compared with the lowest quintile group ( 50.9 % vs. 46.3 % , P < 0.001 ) .  Pre-existent conduction abnormalities ( electrical  factor  ) , calcification of the left ventricular outflow tract  (  anatomical  factor  ) , and balloon valvuloplasty and depth of implantation  ( procedural factors ) were associated with increased risk of  PPI  . Conclusion The  rate of PPI  after  TAVI  with new-generation devices is highly variable . Specific recommendations for implantation of each prosthesis , taking into consideration the presence of pre-existent conduction abnormalities and anatomical factors , may be needed to reduce the risk of PPI."

"eOBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to review the current corpus of human studies to determine the association of various doses and duration s of  fructose consumption  on metabolic syndrome . METHODS We search ed human studies in PubMed , Scopus , Ovid , ISI Web of Science , Cochrane library , and Google Scholar data bases . We search ed for the following keywords in each paper : metabolic syndrome x , insulin resistance , blood glucose , blood sugar , fasting blood sugar , triglycerides , lipoproteins , HDL , cholesterol , LDL , blood pressure , mean arterial pressure , systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , hypertens * , waist circumference , and  fructose , sucrose , high-fructose corn syrup , or sugar .  RESULTS Overall ,  3102 articles were gathered .  We excluded studies on natural fructose content of foods , non- clinical trials , and trials in which  fructose  was recommended exclusively as  sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup .  Overall ,  3069 articles were excluded .  After review by independent review ers ,  15 studies  were included in the meta- analysis . Fructose consumption was positively associated with  increased fasting blood sugar ( FBS  ; summary mean difference , 0.307 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.149 - 0.465 ; P = 0.002 ) ,  elevated triglycerides  ( TG ; 0.275 ; 95 % CI , 0.014 - 0.408 ; P = 0.002 ) ;  and elevated systolic blood pressure  ( SBP ; 0.297 ; 95 % CI , 0.144 - 0.451 ; P = 0.002 ) . The corresponding figure was inverse  for high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol  ( -0.267 ; 95 % CI , -0.406 to -0.128 ; P = 0.001 ) . Significant heterogeneity existed between studies , except for FBS . After excluding studies that led to the highest effect on the heterogeneity test , the association  between   fructose consumption and TG , SBP , and HDL  became non-significant . The results did not show any evidence of publication bias . No missing studies were identified with the trim- and -ﬁll method .   Fructose  consumption from industrialized foods has significant effects on most components of metabolic syndrome."
" Many studies were imperfect in design . Those considered to be the most appropriate for analysis were too limited to undertake a formal statistical exploration .

"sQUESTION What is the effectiveness of strategies to increase the implementation of physiotherapy clinical guidelines ? DESIGN Systematic review . PARTICIPANTS  Physiotherapists treating any type of patients .  INTERVENTION  Single or multiple strategies to increase the implementation of physiotherapy clinical guidelines .  OUTCOME MEASURES  Professional practice , patient health , and cost of care .  RESULTS Five papers reporting  three cluster-r and omised trials  evaluated whether  multifaceted strategies based on educational meetings  increased the  implementation of  low  back pain guidelines  ( 2 trials ) or  whiplash  guidelines ( 1 trial ) .  Educational meetings  were effective in increasing  adherence  to the following recommendations of  low  back pain guidelines  : limiting the number of sessions  ( RD 0.13 , 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.23 ) , using  active intervention  ( RD 0.13 , 95 % CI 0.05 to 0.21 ) ,  giving adequate information  ( RD 0.05 , 95 % CI 0.00 to 0.11 ) ,  increasing activity level  ( RD 0.16 , 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.30 ) , changing  attitudes/beliefs about pain  ( RD 0.13 , 95 % CI 0.01 to 0.24 ) .  Educational meetings  were effective in increasing  adherence to  the following  recommendations  of  whiplash guidelines : reassuring the patient  ( RD 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.07 to 0.74 ) ,  advising the patient to act as usual  ( RD 0.48 , 95 % CI 0.15 to 0.80 ) ,  using functional outcome measures  ( RD 0.62 , 95 % CI 0.32 to 0.92 ) . There was no evidence that  patient health  was improved or that the  cost of care  was reduced .  This review shows that multifaceted  interventions  based on  educational meetings  to increase implementation of clinical guidelines may improve some  outcomes of professional practice  but do not improve  patient health  or  reduce cost of care .  These findings are comparable with results among other health professions."

"dRecurrent  low back pain ( recurrent LBP )  is a common condition , however , it is unclear if uniform definitions are used in studies investigating the prevalence and management of this condition . The aim of this systematic review was to identify how recurrent LBP is defined in the literature . A literature search was performed on MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , AMED , and PEDro .  Studies were considered eligible if they investigated a cohort of subjects with recurrent LBP or if they were measuring the prevalence of recurrent LBP .  Two independent review ers assessed inclusion of studies and extracted definitions of recurrent LBP .  Forty-three studies met the inclusion criteria .  The majority of studies ( 63 % ) gave an explicit definition of  recurrent LBP ;  however , the definitions varied greatly and only three definitions for  recurrent LBP  were used by more than one study . The most common feature given as part of the definition was the  frequency of previous episodes of low back pain .  Only 8 % ( 3/36 ) of studies used previously recommended definitions for  recurrent LBP .  Large variation exists in definitions of  recurrent LBP  used in the literature , making interpretation of prevalence rates and treatment outcomes very difficult . Achieving consensus among experts in this area is required."

"sIntroduction :  Acne scarring  is a very common problem , which can be extensive , and may lead to significant psychosocial morbidity  .  Multiple types of treatments are used to ameliorate  atrophic scars  with varying degrees of success . This paper provides an overview of the various  energy-based  modalities that are commonly employed against  acne scarring .  Objectives and methods : A comprehensive literature search of papers published  since 2008  was performed in order to determine the  efficacy and adverse reactions  of commonly used  energy-based treatments  against  post-acne scarring .  Results : A total of  59 relevant articles were identified  covering a multitude of different devices . Discussion :  Ablative lasers  seem to achieve the highest degree of  efficacy  , albeit this is associated with significant  pain and downtime  , and the risk  for long-term pigmentary changes .   Non-ablative fractional photothermolysis ( FP )  has a much safer profile but can not achieve as good  cosmetic results .  The  efficacies  of fractional  radiofrequency microneedling  and  radiofrequency  are slightly inferior to that of FP but offer an even safer  adverse profile .  Little evidence is available on the remaining devices , with larger studies required in order to reach more solid conclusions . Conclusion : Multiple devices have been used with varying levels of  efficacy  and very different  safety profiles .  There is an overall lack of high- quality evidence about the effects of different interventions . Furthermore , no st and ardised scale is available for acne scarring , leading to variability in evaluation and interpretation of data in different studies."
"sThe  avoidance model  in  patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis ( OA )  hypothesizes that  pain  and  psychological distress  lead to avoidance of activities , and thereby to muscle weakness and activity limitations . This paper systematic ally review s the scientific evidence for the validity of this  avoidance model .  A qualitative data synthesis was used to identify levels of evidence .  Sixty studies were included .  In knee OA , strong evidence was found that  avoidance of activities  is associated with activity limitations via muscle weakness ( mediation by muscle weakness ) , strong evidence was found for an association between muscle weakness and  activity  limitations , and weak evidence was found that  pain and psychological distress  are associated with muscle weakness via avoidance of activities ( mediation by avoidance ) . In hip OA , weak evidence was found for mediation by muscle weakness ; and strong evidence was found for an association between  muscle weakness and activity limitations .  More research is needed on the consecutive associations between  pain or psychological distress , avoidance of activities  and muscle weakness , and to confirm causal relationships."
" The presence of a  diabetes specialist nurse / nurse case manager  may improve patients ' diabetic control over short time periods , but from currently available trials the effects over longer periods of time are not evident . There were no significant differences overall in  hypoglycaemic episodes , hyperglycaemic incidents , or hospital admissions . Quality of life  was not shown to be affected by input from a diabetes specialist nurse/nurse case manager."
" Very low quality evidence is available from single trials , thus we are uncertain if  hip pre caution s  with or without the addition of equipment and  functional  restrictions are effective in preventing dislocation and improving  outcomes  after THA . There is also insufficient evidence to support or refute the adoption of a  postoperative community rehabilitation programme  consisting of functional reintegration and education compared to  conventional rehabilitation  strategies based on functional outcomes .Further high- quality trials are warranted to assess the  outcomes  of different  occupational therapy interventions  both in the short and longer-term for those who undergo THA . An assessment of the impact of such interventions on  pain and restriction on personal ADL , EADL and instrumental ADL  is needed , and also of functional integration-type interventions rather than just hip pre caution s , equipment and restrictions."
"sPURPOSE To up date American Society of Clinical Oncology/American Society of Hematology recommendations for use of  erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs )  in  patients with cancer .  METHODS An Up date Committee review ed data  published between January 2007 and January 2010 .  MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were search ed . RESULTS The literature search yielded one new  individual patient data analysis  and four literature -based meta-analyses , two systematic review s , and 13 publications reporting new results from r and omized controlled trials not included in prior or new review s. RECOMMENDATIONS For  patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy who have a hemoglobin ( Hb ) level less than 10 g/dL  , the Up date Committee recommends that clinicians discuss potential harms ( eg ,  thromboembolism , shorter survival )  and benefits ( eg , decreased transfusions ) of  ESAs  and compare these with potential harms ( eg ,  serious infections , immune-mediated adverse reactions )  and benefits ( eg ,  rapid Hb improvement  ) of  RBC  transfusions . Individual preferences for assumed risk should contribute to shared decisions on managing chemotherapy-induced anemia . The Committee caution s against  ESA  use under other circumstances . If used ,  ESAs  should be administered at the lowest dose possible and should increase Hb to the lowest concentration possible to avoid transfusions . Available evidence does not identify  Hb levels  ≥  10 g/dL  either as thresholds for initiating treatment or as targets for  ESA  therapy . Starting doses and dose modifications after response or nonresponse should follow US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling .  ESAs  should be discontinued after 6 to 8 weeks in nonresponders .  ESAs  should be avoided in  patients with cancer not receiving concurrent chemotherapy  , except for those with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes . Caution should be exercised when using  ESAs  with chemotherapeutic agents in diseases associated with increased  risk of thromboembolic complications  . Table 1 lists detailed recommendations."
"nAlthough  regular physical activity ( PA )  is a cornerstone of treatment for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , most adults with T2D are sedentary . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) have proven the effectiveness of  PA behavioral interventions  for  adults with T2D  but have rarely been conducted in healthcare setting s. We sought to identify  PA interventions  that are effective and practical to implement in clinical practice setting s. Our first aim was to use the  valid Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary 2 ( PRECIS-2 ) tool  to assess the potential for future implementation of  PA interventions  in clinical practice setting s. Our second aim was to identify interventions that  effectively increased PA and glycemic control  among the interventions in the top tertile of PRECIS-2 scores . We search ed PubMed MEDLINE from January 1980 through May 2015 for RCTs of  behavioral PA interventions  coordinated by clinical practice s for  patients with T2D .  Dual investigators assessed pragmatism  by PRECIS-2 scores  , and study effectiveness was extracted from original RCT publications . The  PRECIS-2 scores  of the 46  behavioral   interventions ( n = 13,575 participants )  ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 , where 5 is the most pragmatic score . In the most pragmatic tertile of interventions ( n = 16 ) by  PRECIS-2 scores  , 30.8 and 31.3 % of interventions  improved PA outcomes and hemoglobin A1c  , respectively . A minority of published  evidence -based PA interventions  for  adults with T2D  were both  effective and pragmatic  for clinical implementation . These should be tested for dissemination using implementation trial design."
" These findings continue to support the importance of minimizing screen time for disease prevention and health promotion in the early years , but also highlight the potential cognitive benefits of interactive non-screen-based sedentary behaviours such as reading and storytelling . Additional high- quality research using valid and reliable measures is needed to more definitively establish the relationships between duration s , patterns , and types of  SB  and  health indicators  , and to provide insight into the appropriate dose of SB for optimal health in the early years."
" Overall , it appears that the  physical activity  levels of people involved in such programs vary across individuals depending on psychosocial , demographic , weather and climatic factors . Statistical models can provide a better underst and ing of the impact of these factors , allowing for the provision of more personalised  physical activity  programs , which are expected to produce better immediate and long-term outcomes for participants . It is hoped that this review will identify the statistical methods which are most suitable for this purpose."
 The results of this systematic review suggest that  BZDs  should be considered relatively contraindicated for  patients with PTSD or recent trauma .  Evidence -based treatments for PTSD should be favored over BZDs.
"gA systematic review was conducted to determine the extent to which an economic case has been made in  high-income countries  for investment in interventions to promote mental health and well-being  .  We focused on areas of interest to the Data Prev project : early years and parenting  interventions  , actions set in schools and workplaces and measures targeted at  older people .  Economic evaluations had to have some focus on promotion of  mental health  and  well-being  and /or primary prevention of poor  mental health  through health-related means . Studies preventing  exacerbations  in existing mental health problems were excluded , with the exception of support for  parents with mental health problems  , which might indirectly affect the  mental health of   their  children  .  Overall  47 studies were identified .  There was considerable variability in their quality , with a variety of outcome measures and different perspectives : societal , public purse , employer or health system used , making policy comparisons difficult . Caution must therefore be exercised in interpreting results , but the case for investment in  parenting and health visitor-related programmes  appears most strong , especially when impacts beyond the health sector are taken into account . In the workplace an  economic  return on investment in a number of  comprehensive workplace health promotion programmes  and stress management projects ( largely in the USA ) was reported , while  group-based exercise and psychosocial interventions  are of potential benefit to  older people .  Many gaps remain ; a key first step would be to make more use of the existence evidence base on effectiveness and model mid- to long-term  costs  and benefits of action in different context s and setting."
" :  Psychoeducation  is a psychosocial treatment that has been well documented as an adjunct to pharmacological therapy . However , there are only a few studies regarding its  effectiveness  on  adult patients with major depressive disorder .  Although the publications in this area are still very limited , the articles selected in this review suggest that  psychoeducation  is effective in improving the clinical course , treatment adherence , and psychosocial functioning of depressive patients."
"sObjective : To determine in a systematic review , whether interventions for  infant development  that involve  parents  , improve  neurodevelopment at 12 months corrected age or older .  Study Design : R and omized trials were identified where an  infant intervention  was aim ed to improve development and involved  parents of preterms  ; and long-term neurodevelopment using st and ardized tests at 12 months ( or longer ) was reported . Result :  Identified studies ( n=25 )  used a variety of interventions  including parent education , infant stimulation , home visits or individualized developmental care .  Meta- analysis at 12 months  ( N=2198 infants )  found significantly higher  mental  ( N=2198 ) and  physical  ( N=1319 )  performance scores  favoring the intervention group . At 24 months , the  mental  ( N=1490  ) performance scores  were  improved  , but  physical  ( N=1025 )  performance scores  were not statistically  significant  . The  improvement  in  neurodevelopmental outcome  was not sustained at 36 months ( N=961 ) and 5 years ( N=1017 ) . Conclusion : Positive clinical ly meaningful effects ( > 5 points ) are seen to an age of 36 months , but are no longer present at 5 years."
" This study is the first systematic review of decision analytic model-based cost-effectiveness analyses of DHIs in the management of  CVDs  .

"sPURPOSE To review systematic ally the literature on  fall  risk  factors  for  young patients affected by neurological disorders .  METHOD A systematic search of all primary research -based literature on   risk factors for  falls or fall  characteristics   in  young adults ( mean age < 55 years ) published prior to July 2012  was conducted using 11 data bases . Studies that focused on  fall risk screening tools  ,  fear  of  falling  or  interventions  for fall  prevention  were excluded . Two review ers independently agreed on eligibility and method ological quality and extracted data . RESULTS Twenty-three  final  studies were selected , including 21 observational studies ; one r and omised controlled trial and one qualitative study . An average of 50.2 % of the  2776 total participants  experienced at least  one fall .  Among the multiple risk factors studied , a reduced  performance in balance and gait  was consistently associated with falls , while the contribution of single physical and cognitive impairments was variable in different population s. Walking aids , wheelchair characteristics and environmental hazards are significant environmental risk factors . The heterogeneity of the assessment tools used to measure risk factors limited comparison across studies .   Falling  is a common problem among  young patients affected by neurological disorders  , although the risk of falling for a specific individual is difficult to predict and the risk of a severe fall-related injury has not yet been established . IMPLICATION S FOR REHABILITATION  Young patients with impaired gait and balance or medium to severe motor disability  appear to be at increased risk of falling .  Patients  who are  relatively independent  and still  participating  in challenging activities have an increased exposure to  fall-risk .  Walking aids , wheelchair characteristics and environmental hazards are significant environmental risk factors . These risk factors should be monitored closely in the  young neurological  population to help prevent falls."

" Of the eight studies that review ed the effect of the cannabinoid THC , five found THC to be more effective than  placebo  , one found THC to be more effective than  placebo  in American patients but ineffective in patients from other countries , and two found THC to be no more effective than  placebo .  The study that review ed the effect of the  whole plant cannabis  found that there was a significant decrease in  pain  among those  patients  smoking cannabis . NURSING PRACTICE IMPLICATION S The lack of evidence in this field of research suggests a need to change policy surrounding cannabis research."
"hBACKGROUND Although the link between cannabis use and development of psychosis is well established , less is known about the effect of continued versus discontinued cannabis use after the onset of psychosis . We aim ed to summarise available evidence focusing on the relationship between continued and discontinued cannabis use after onset of psychosis and its relapse . METHODS In this systematic review and meta- analysis , we search ed MEDLINE for  articles published in any language from the data base inception date up until April 21 , 2015 that included a sample of patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder with a follow-up duration of at least 6 months .  We used a combination of search terms for describing  cannabis  , the outcome of interest ( relapse of psychosis ) , and the study population . We excluded studies if continued cannabis use or discontinued cannabis use could not be established . We compared  relapse  outcomes between those who  continued (  CC ) or  discontinued (  DC ) cannabis use or were non-users ( NC ) . We used summary data ( individual patient data were not sought out ) to estimate  Cohen 's d  , which was entered into r and om effects models ( REM ) to compare CC with NC , CC with DC , and DC with NC . Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were used to address the issue of heterogeneity . FINDINGS  Of 1903 citations identified , 24 studies ( 16 565 participants ) met the inclusion criteria .  Independent of the stage of illness , continued cannabis users had a greater  increase in relapse of psychosis  than did both non-users ( dCC-NC=0·36 , 95 % CI 0·22 - 0·50 , p<0·0001 ) and discontinued users ( dCC-DC=0·28 , 0·12 - 0·44 , p=0·0005 ) , as  well as longer hospital  admissions than non-users ( dCC-NC=0·36 , 0·13 to 0·58 , p=0·02 ) . By contrast , cannabis discontinuation was not  associated with relapse  ( dDC-NC=0·02 , -0·12 to 0·15 ; p=0·82 ) . Meta-regression suggested greater effects of continued cannabis use than discontinued use  on relapse  ( dCC-NC=0·36 vs dDC-NC=0·02 ,  p=0·04 ) , positive  symptoms ( dCC-NC=0·15 vs dDC-NC=-0·30 ,  p=0·05 ) and level of functioning  ( dCC-NC=0·04 vs dDC-NC=-0·49 , p=0·008 ) but not on negative symptoms ( dCC-NC=-0·09 vs dDC-NC=-0·31 , p=0·41 ) . INTERPRETATION Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts  adverse  outcome ,  including higher relapse rates , longer hospital admissions , and more severe positive symptoms  than for individuals who discontinue cannabis use and those who are non-users . These findings point to reductions in cannabis use as a crucial interventional target to improve outcome in  patients with psychosis  . FUNDING UK National Institute of Health Research."
"sUpper  extremity motor performance  declines with increasing age . However ,  older adults  need to maintain , learn new and relearn known motor tasks . Research with  young adults  indicated that  regular  and  acute physical activity  might facilitate  motor performance  and  motor learning processes .  Therefore , this review aim ed to examine the association between  chronic physical activity and acute bouts of exercise  on  motor performance and motor learning  in upper extremity motor tasks in  older adults .  Literature was search ed via Cochrane library , PubMED , PsycINFO and Scopus and  27 studies met all inclusion criteria  . All studies dealt with the influence of chronic  physical activity  on  motor performance or motor learning  , no appropriate study examining the influence of an acute  bout of exercise  in older adults was found . Results concerning the association of  chronic  physical  activity and motor performance  are mixed and seem to be influenced by the study design , kind of exercise , motor task , and exercise intensity . Regarding  motor learning  , a high physical activity or cardiovascular fitness level seems to boost the initial phase  of motor learning ;  results differ with respect to  motor retention .  Overall ,  (  motor-coordinative  )  intervention studies seem to be more promising than cross-sectional studies."
"ePresently ,  hydrolyzed formulas ( HF )  are used primarily in  infants that can not be exclusively breastfed  ,  those with cow 's milk allergy  and for primary prevention of allergic disease , but  HFs  are increasingly being used worldwide , begging the question if they may be recommended as the optimal choice for all  st and ard-risk , full-term , non-exclusively breastfed infants .  Data regarding the nutritional adequacy of modern-day HFs are scarce and lack long-term data suggesting that growth in infants fed  HF  versus an  intact protein formula ( IPF )  is different . While human breast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for multiple reasons , a 2006 systematic review determined there were no comparable long-term studies regarding prolonged use of HFs versus breastfeeding . Meta-analyses of  formula consumption  and  risk of atopic dermatitis ( AD )  have found that infants fed partially HF compared to IPF had a lower  risk of AD  , but there are significant limitations to these studies , making conclusions about the general use of HFs problematic .  Costs  should be considered in decision-making regarding the choice of the formula , but global comparison of this is difficult given large cost differences in different countries . Despite the issues raised here , the desire to provide concrete recommendations of widespread HF use needs to be balanced carefully in order not to overstate cl aims of benefit . Long-term studies are needed to investigate the  feasibility of HF  as a  routine feeding  option for  healthy , st and ard-risk infants .  Because of the paucity of data , routine use of  HF  as an equivalent option to breastfeeding or IPF can not be supported at present based on available scientific evidence."
"eBackground  Moxibustion  is a traditional Chinese method that uses the heat generated by burning herbal preparations containing Artemisia vulgaris to stimulate acupuncture points . Considering  moxibustion  is closely related to acupuncture , it seems pertinent to evaluate the effectiveness of  moxibustion  as a treatment of symptoms of cancer . The objective of this review was to systematic ally assess the effectiveness of  moxibustion  for supportive cancer care . Methods We search ed the  literature using 11 data bases from their inceptions to February 2010 , without language restrictions .  We included r and omised clinical trials ( RCTs ) in which  moxibustion  was employed as an adjuvant treatment for conventional medicine in  patients with any type of cancer .  The selection of studies , data extraction , and validations were performed independently by two review ers . Results Five RCTs compared the  effects of  moxibustion  with  conventional therapy .   Four RCTs failed to show favourable  effects of  moxibustion   for  response rate  compared with  chemotherapy  (  n = 229  , RR , 1.04 , 95 % CI 0.94 to 1.15 , P = 0.43 ) . Two RCTs assessed the  occurrence of side effects of chemotherapy  and showed favourable effects of  moxibustion  . A meta- analysis showed significant less  frequency of nausea and vomiting  from  chemotherapy for  moxibustion  group ( n =  80 , RR , 0.38 , 95 % CIs 0.22 to 0.65 , P = 0.0005 , heterogeneity : χ2 = 0.18 , P = 0.67 , I2 = 0 % ) . Conclusion The evidence is limited to  suggest moxibustion  is an effective supportive cancer care  in nausea and vomiting  . However , all studies have a high risk of bias so effectively there is not enough evidence to draw any conclusion . Further research is required to investigate whether there are specific  benefits of moxibustion  for supportive cancer care."
"eAbstract Hypertension is the most important risk factor for  stroke  and stroke recurrence . However , the preferred blood  pressure  (BP)-lowering drug class for  patients who have suffered from a stroke  has yet to be determined . To investigate the relative effects of BP-lowering  therapies [ angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) , angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARB ) , & bgr ; blockers , calcium channel blockers ( CCBs ) , diuretics , and combinations of these drugs ]  in  patients with a prior stroke history  , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis using both traditional frequentist and Bayesian r and om-effects models and meta-regression of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on the outcomes  of recurrent stroke , coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , and any major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events ( MACCE ) .  Trials were identified from search es of published hypertension guidelines , electronic data bases , and previous systematic review s .  Fifteen RCTs composed of 39,329 participants with previous stroke were identified .  Compared with the  placebo  , only  ACEI  along with  diuretics  significantly  reduced recurrent stroke events  [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 0.54 , 95 % credibility interval ( 95 % CI ) 0.33–0.90 ] . On the basis of the distribution of posterior probabilities , the treatment ranking consistently identified  ACEI  along with  diuretics  as the preferred  BP-lowering  strategy for the reduction of  recurrent stroke  and CHD ( 31 % and 35 % , respectively ) . For preventing  MACCE  , diuretics appeared to be the preferred agent for stroke survivors ( 34 % ) . Moreover , the meta-regression analysis failed to demonstrate a  statistical significance between BP reduction  and  all  outcomes ( P = 0.1618 for total stroke , 0.4933 for CHD , and 0.2411 for MACCE ) . Evidence from RCTs supports the use of  diuretics-based  treatment , especially when combined with  ACEI  , for the secondary  prevention of recurrent stroke and any vascular events  in patients who have suffered from stroke."
"nBackground : Respiratory tract infections (  RTIs  ) represent one of the main health problems in  children .  Probiotics are viable bacteria that colonize the intestine and affect the host intestinal microbial balance . Accumulating evidence suggests that  probiotic consumption  may decrease the  incidence  of or  modify RTIs .  The authors systematic ally review ed data from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to investigate the effect of  probiotic consumption  on   RTIs  in children .  Methods : MEDLINE / PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , and Web of Science were systematic ally search ed for RCTs regarding the effect of   probiotics  on RTIs in children .  The outcomes included  number of children experienced with at least 1 RTI episode , duration of illness episodes , days of illness per subject , and school/day care absenteeism due to infection .  A r and om-effects model was used to calculate pooled relative risks , or mean difference ( MD ) with the corresponding 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Results : A  total of 23 trials involving 6269 children were eligible for inclusion  in the systematic review . None of the trials showed a high risk of bias . The quality of the evidence of outcomes was moderate .  The age range of subjects was from newborn to 18 years .  The results of meta- analysis showed that  probiotic consumption  significantly decreased  the number of subjects having at least 1 RTI episode  ( 17 RCTs , 4513 children , relative risk 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.82–0.96 , P = 0.004 ) . Children supplemented with  probiotics  had  fewer numbers of days of RTIs  per person compared with children who had taken a  placebo  ( 6 RCTs , 2067 children , MD −0.16 , 95 % CI −0.29 to 0.02 , P = 0.03 ) , and had  fewer numbers of days absent from day care/school  ( 8 RCTs , 1499 children , MD −0.94 , 95 % CI −1.72 to −0.15 , P = 0.02 ) . However , there was no statistically significant  difference of illness episode duration  between probiotic intervention group and placebo group ( 9 RCTs , 2817 children , MD −0.60 , 95 % CI −1.49 to 0.30 , P = 0.19 ) . Conclusion : Based on the available data and taking into account the safety profile of RCTs ,  probiotic consumption  appears to be a feasible way to decrease  the  incidence of  RTIs  in children."
 The  Timed Up- and -Go  test measure appears not to be a useful measure of physical functioning for the driving outcomes included here . The Rapid Pace Walk may be useful in studies of driving ability and exposure . More driving studies should consider using the Short Physical Performance Battery to determine if it may be useful as a risk factor assessment for identifying individuals at risk of certain driving outcomes.
"nOBJECTIVE To review the evidence concerning the effects of   postoperative exercise interventions   on  exercise capacity  and  health-related quality of life   following resection for non-small cell lung cancer  , and to review whether different initiation times of exercise produce different effects on exercise capacity . DATA SOURCES Comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE , Embase , CENTRAL , CINAHL and PEDro . STUDY SELECTION  R and omized  controlled trials examining the effects of  exercise interventions  were eligible for inclusion . DATA EXTRACTION Postoperative outcome measurements were extracted and the quality of evidence was grade d using Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) Working Group . DATA SYNTHESIS  Four r and omized controlled trials  were identified  involving 262 participants .  Short-term follow-up ( 12 - 20 weeks ) showed significantly higher  exercise capacity and physical component of health-related quality of life  in the intervention group ( st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) 0.48 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.04 - 0.93 ) compared with the control group ( SMD 0.50 ; 95 % CI 0.19 - 0.82 ) . There was no difference between the effect of late- and early-initiated  exercise intervention .  Exercise  has a small-to-moderate effect at short-term follow-up on  exercise capacity  and the  physical component of health-related quality of life  in  patients operated for lung cancer .  The long-term effects of exercise capacity are unknown .  Early-initiated exercise programmes  ( 2 weeks post-operation ) did not show an effect on exercise capacity . These findings should be interpreted with caution."
"sCash  transfers ( CTs )  are now high on the agenda of most governments in  low- and middle-income countries .  Within the field of health promotion ,  CTs  constitute a healthy public policy initiative as they have the potential to address the  social determinants of health  (  SDoH )  and health inequalities . A systematic review was conducted to synthesis e the evidence on  CTs  ' impacts on SDoH and health inequalities in  sub-Saharan Africa  , and to identify the barriers and facilitators of effective CTs .  Twenty-one electronic data bases and the websites of 14 key organizations  were  search  ed in addition to grey literature and h and search ing of selected journals for quantitative and qualitative studies on  CTs  ' impacts on SDoH and health outcomes .  Out of 182 full texts screened for eligibility , 79 reports that reported findings from 53 studies were included in the final review .  The studies were undertaken within  24  CTs  comprising 11  unconditional CTs ( UCTs )  , 8  conditional CTs ( CCTs )  and 5  combined UCTs and CCTs .   The review found that  CTs  can be effective in tackling structural determinants of  health  such as  financial poverty , education , household resilience , child labour , social capital and social cohesion , civic participation , and birth registration .  The review further found that  CTs  modify  intermediate determinants  such as  nutrition , dietary diversity , child deprivation , sexual risk behaviours , teen pregnancy and early marriage .  In conjunction with their influence on  SDoH  , there is moderate evidence from the review that  CTs  impact on  health and quality of life outcomes .  The review also found many factors relating to intervention design features , macro-economic stability , household dynamics and community acceptance of programs that could influence the effectiveness of  CTs .  The external validity of the review findings is strong as the findings are largely consistent with those from  Latin America .  The findings thus provide useful insights to policy makers and managers and can be used to  optimise CTs  to reduce health inequalities."

"sOBJECTIVE The objectives of this work were to fill the gap in the scientific literature and to evaluate the  results of  physical therapy treatments   in  individuals affected by chronic fatigue syndrome  , considering only studies that employed a r and omized controlled trial . METHODS A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines . Three bibliographic data bases were search ed : MEDLINE , Cochrane Library , and PEDro . The minimum prerequisites for papers to be included in the systematic review were that they had to ( a ) employ a r and omized controlled trial  ;  ( b  )  be  published in English ; and ( c ) be published during the last ten years ( 2007 - 2017 )  . The studies were evaluated according to  Jadad score .  RESULTS  Four studies were included  . This systematic review suggests that a treatment that is more effective than all the others can not be defined . This conclusion is related to the low number of investigated studies ; therefore , the collected results can not be generalized .  Chronic fatigue syndrome is not yet a well-understood pathology , and the physical mechanisms that influence the outcomes still need more study  . Rehabilitation programs that promote physiotherapy techniques such as exercise , mobilization , and body awareness ( e.g.  ,  MRT and GET )  are the most effective in  reducing medium and long-term fatigue severity  in CFS patients."
"9Background The  Paleolithic diet  has been studied in the scope of prevention and control of chronic noncommunicable diseases ( CNCD ) . The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of the  Paleolithic diet  on the prevention and control of CNCD in  humans  , specifically on  anthropometric markers  , through a systematic review with meta- analysis . Methods What is the effect of the  Paleolithic diet  on  anthropometric parameters (  weight , body mass index and waist circumference ) compared to other control  diets  based on recommendations in adults ? We included only  r and omized studies with humans that used the  Paleolithic Diet  in the prevention and control of CNCD published in Portuguese , English or Spanish .  The search period was until March 2019 , in the LILACS , PubMed , Scielo , Science Direct , Medline , Web of Science and Scopus data bases . The abstract s were evaluated by two research ers . We found  1224 articles , of which 24 were selected and 11 were included in the meta- analysis .  The effect of dietary use  on body weight , body mass index and waist circumference  was evaluated . Results The summary of the effect showed a loss of − 3.52 kg in  the mean  weight ( CI 95 % : − 5.26 ; − 1.79 ; p < 0,001 ; I2 = 24 % ) of people who adopted the Paleolithic diet compared to diets based on recommendations . The analysis showed a positive association of adopting the Paleolithic diet in  relation to weight loss .  The effect was  significant on weight , body mass index and waist circumference  . Conclusion The Paleolithic diet may assist in  controlling weight and waist circumference  and in the management of chronic diseases . However , more r and omized clinical studies with larger population s and duration are necessary to prove health benefits .Trial registration CRD42015027849."
"mDyslipidemia and hyperglycemia are associated with an increased risk of   ischemic cardiovascular disease .   Positive effects of a  nutraceutical combination comprising red yeast rice , berberine , policosanol , astaxanthin , coenzyme Q10 and folic acid ( NComb )  on  plasma lipid and glucose levels  have been reported in some but not all clinical trials . To address this inconsistency , we tried to estimate the size of  lipid- and glucose-lowering  effects of  NComb  through a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials . A systematic literature search in PubMed - Medline , SCOPUS and Google Scholar data bases was conducted to identify r and omized controlled trials investigating the effects of NComb on  plasma lipids and glucose levels  . Inverse variance-weighted mean differences ( WMDs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated for net changes in lipid  and glucose levels  using a r and om-effects model . R and om-effects meta-regression was performed to assess the effect of putative confounders on plasma lipid and glucose  levels  .  Fourteen trials ( 1670 subjects in the NComb arm and 1489 subjects in the control arm ) met the eligibility criteria for lipid analysis and 10 trials ( 1014 subjects in the NComb arm and 962 subjects in the control arm ) for glucose analysis  . Overall ,  WMDs  were significant for the impact of  NComb   supplementation on plasma levels of total cholesterol (  -26.15mg/dL ,  p<0.001 ) , LDL-cholesterol  ( -23.85mg/dL ,  p<0.001 ) , HDL-cholesterol  ( 2.53mg/dL ,  p<0.001 ) , triglycerides  ( -13.83mg/dL ,  p<0.001  )  and glucose  ( -2.59mg/dL ,  p=0.010 )  .  NComb-induced amelioration of lipid profile  was not affected by duration of supplementation nor by  baseline  lipid  levels ;  conversely , a  greater glucose-lowering effect  of  NComb  was found with higher  baseline glucose levels  and longer duration s of supplementation . In conclusion , the present results suggest that NComb supplementation is associated with  improvement of lipid and glucose profile .  Short-term beneficial effects of NComb supplementation appear to be maintained in the long term."
"sBACKGROUND A number of recent systematic review s have result ed in changes in international recommendations for  children 's participation  in  physical activity ( PA )  for health . The World Health Authority ( WHO ) has recently released new recommendations . The WHO still recommends 60 min of  moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA )  , but also emphasises that these minutes should be on top of everyday physical activities . Everyday physical activities total around 30 min of MVPA in the quintile of the least active children , which means that the new recommendations constitute more activity in total compared with earlier recommendations . OBJECTIVE To summarise evidence justifying new  PA  recommendation for  cardiovascular health in children .  METHODS The results of recent systematic review s are discussed and supplemented with relevant literature not included in these review s. PubMed was search ed for the years 2006 - 2011 for additional topics not sufficiently covered by the review s. RESULTS  PA  was associated with  lower blood pressure and a healthier lipid  blood profile  in children .  The association was stronger when a composite risk factor score was analysed , and the associations between physical fitness and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factors were even stronger . Muscle strength and endurance exercise each had an effect on  blood lipids and insulin sensitivity  even if the effect was smaller for muscle strength than for aerobic exercise . New evidence suggests possible  effects  of  PA   on C-reactive protein .   There is accumulating evidence that  PA  can have beneficial effects on the risk factors of  CVD in children .  Public health policy to promote  PA  in  children  , especially the most sedentary children , may be a key element to prevent the onset of CVD later in the children 's lives."

" There is good- quality evidence that a  GP alerting system  with or without  patient-directed  education on osteoporosis improves  guideline -consistent GP behaviour  , result ing in better diagnosis and  treatment rates .  Interventions such as  GP reminder messages and GP feedback on performance combined with guideline dissemination  may lead to small improvements in  guideline -consistent GP behaviour  with regard to low back pain , while GP education on osteoarthritis pain and the use of educationally influential physicians may lead to slight improvement in  patient  outcomes and guideline -consistent behaviour respectively . However , further studies are needed to ascertain the  effectiveness  of such interventions in improving GP behaviour and patient outcomes."
"dBackground / objectives  Walking  has well-established positive relationships with , and effects on , physical health . In contrast , while poor mental health contributes substantially to global health burden , an overview of the benefits from  walking  has not previously been published . We aim ed to scope the literature and present what is known , and highlight what is not known , about walking and mental health . Methods Design : Scoping review . Data sources : Ovid ( Medline ) , ProQuest , Web of Science . Screening and reporting :  13 014 records were identified  and screened by a team of research ers . Included full texts were analysed and reported according to mental health outcome . Results For the 8 mental health outcomes ( identified a priori ) , there were a total of 5 systematic review s and 50 individual papers included . Depression had the most evidence and existing systematic review s were reported . Evidence for  anxiety , psychological stress , psychological well-being , subjective well-being and social isolation and loneliness  varied in volume and effectiveness , but no  harmful effects  were identified . There were no studies for  walking  and  resilience  . The setting and context of  walking  seems to be important variables . Conclusion The evidence base that suggests  walking  benefits mental health is growing , but remains fragmented and incomplete for some important outcomes . Policy and national guidelines should promote the known mental health benefits of  increased walking  and future research should directly address the gaps we have identified."
"eBackground  Elective surgeries  can be associated with significant harm to  older adults .  The present study aim ed to identify the prognostic factors associated with the development of postoperative complications among  older adults undergoing  elective surgery .   Methods Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and AgeLine were search ed for  articles published between inception and April 21 , 2016 .  Prospect i ve studies reporting prognostic factors associated with postoperative complications ( composite outcome of medical and surgical complications ) , functional decline , mortality ,  post-hospitalization  discharge destination , and  prolonged hospitalization  among  older adults undergoing  elective surgery   were included . Study characteristics and prognostic factors associated with the outcomes of interest were extracted independently by two review ers . R and om effects meta- analysis models were used to derive pooled effect estimates for prognostic factors and incidences of adverse outcomes . Results Of the  5692 titles and abstract s that were screened for inclusion , 44 studies ( 12,281 patients )  reported on the following adverse postoperative  outcomes : postoperative complications  ( n = 28 ) ,  postoperative mortality  ( n = 11 ) ,  length of hospitalization  ( n = 21 ) ,  functional decline  ( n = 6 ) , and  destination at discharge from hospital  ( n = 13 ) . The  pooled incidence of postoperative complications  was 25.17 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 18.03–33.98 % , number needed to follow = 4 ) . The geriatric syndromes of frailty ( odds ratio ( OR ) 2.16 , 95 % CI 1.29–3.62 ) and cognitive impairment ( OR 2.01 , 95 % CI 1.44–2.81 ) were associated with developing postoperative complications ; however , there was no association with traditionally assessed prognostic factors such as age ( OR 1.07 , 95 % CI 1.00–1.14 ) or American Society of Anesthesiologists status ( OR 2.62 , 95 % CI 0.78–8.79 ) . Besides frailty , other potentially modifiable prognostic factors , including  depressive symptoms  ( OR 1.77 , 95 % CI 1.22–2.56 ) and smoking ( OR 2.43 , 95 % CI 1.32–4.46 ) , were also associated with developing postoperative complications . Conclusion Geriatric syndromes are important prognostic factors for postoperative complications . We identified potentially modifiable prognostic factors ( e.g. , frailty , depressive symptoms , and smoking ) associated with developing postoperative complications that can be targeted preoperatively to optimize care."
"sThe present study aims to identify the range of   eating behavior self- assessment  tools  reported in the  adult bariatric surgery literature  and evaluate the measurement properties of these tools using pre-established criteria . This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta- analysis ( PRISMA ) guidelines . This review revealed the use of 20 distinct tools ; however , evidence for measurement properties specific to  bariatric surgery population  s was limited to only ten of these tools , as reported in 14 papers .  Validity  varied extensively and there was a widespread lack of information regarding  measurement of change over time and patient burden .  According to the evaluation criteria , there was adequate support for two tools . Several other tools show potential but would benefit from additional investigation of their measurement properties prior to continued use with bariatric surgery patients."

"sThis evidence base up date examines the level of empirical support for interventions for  children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) younger than 5 years old .  It focuses on research published since a previous review in this journal ( Rogers & Vismara , 2008 ) . We identified  psychological or behavioral interventions  that had been manualized and evaluated in either ( a ) experimental or quasi-experimental group studies or ( b ) systematic review s of single-subject studies . We extracted data from  all studies that met these criteria  and were published after the previous review . Interventions were categorized across two dimensions . First , primary theoretical principles included  applied behavior analysis ( ABA ) , developmental social-pragmatic ( DSP )  , or both . Second , practice elements included scope ( comprehensive or focused ) , modality ( individual intervention with the child , parent training , or classrooms ) , and intervention targets ( e.g. , spoken language or alternative and augmentative communication ) . We classified two interventions as well-established  (  individual ,  comprehensive ABA and teacher-implemented  ,  focused ABA + DSP )  , 3 as probably efficacious  ( individual , focused ABA for augmentative and alternative communication ; individual  ,  focused ABA + DSP ; and focused DSP  parent  training )  , and 5 as possibly efficacious  (  individual ,  comprehensive ABA + DSP ; comprehensive ABA classrooms ; focused ABA for spoken communication ; focused ABA parent training ;  and teacher-implemented ,  focused DSP )  . The evidence base for ASD interventions has grown substantially since 2008 . An increasing number of interventions have some empirical support ; others are emerging as potentially efficacious . Priorities for future research include improving outcome measures , developing interventions for understudied ASD symptoms ( e.g. ,  repetitive behaviors )  , pinpointing mechanisms of action in interventions , and adapting interventions for implementation with fidelity by community providers."
" Topical  ketoprofen  in Transfersome gel is an effective means of treating symptoms of knee OA , and is superior to oral celecoxib , oral  placebo  and topical  placebo .  The most commonly reported adverse events associated with the use of topical  ketoprofen  in Transfersome gel were  non-severe skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders .  Furthermore , as topical  ketoprofen  in Transfersome gel was associated with fewer adverse events when compared with oral celecoxib , and had  rates of GI adverse events  comparable with those of topical placebo , it may be ideal for those who are unable to take oral NSAIDs."
" The knowledge in the field of diagnosis , staging , and treatment of localised PCa is evolving rapidly . The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for the use in clinical practice . These are the first PCa guidelines endorsed by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management . A full version is available from the EAU office and online ( http://uroweb.org/ guideline /prostate-cancer/ ) . PATIENT SUMMARY The 2016 EAU-STRO-IOG Prostate Cancer ( PCa ) Guidelines present up date d information on the diagnosis , and treatment of clinical ly localised prostate cancer . In  Northern and Western Europe  , the number of men diagnosed  with  PCa has been on the rise . This may be due to an increase in  opportunistic screening  , but other factors may also be involved ( eg ,  diet , sexual behaviour , low exposure to ultraviolet radiation )  . We propose that  men who are potential c and i date s for  screening   should be engaged in a discussion with their clinician ( also involving their families and caregivers ) so that an informed decision may be made as part of an individualised risk-adapted approach."
"DOBJECTIVE To identify the strategies used in the development of planned and scientifically  documented physical activity  , as well as the results achieved with those interventions in  children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) .  METHODS Systematic analysis of scientific articles regarding the use of  physical activity  as a therapeutic tool for  children with ASD . Articles published between 2006 and 2016  were included in the review .  Participants  in the  selected articles had to be children diagnosed with ASD ;  the interventions carried out had to involve some kind of  physical activity  , and their effects had to be clearly exposed . RESULTS Six intervention strategies with  autistic children  were found . DISCUSSION  Physical activity  has a positive impact on the health and wellness of human beings , as well as a major role in the prevention of several chronic pathologies . Planned and correctly directed  physical activity  allows developing  motor skills  and generating  positive psychological context s and behavioral changes  in children with ASD."

"9Independent systematic review s of the totality of the evidence by governments and international agencies throughout the world uniformly conclude that  population -wide interventions to reduce salt  are beneficial for health . However , some scientists continue to produce and cite studies with paradoxical findings that conflict with the evidence base used to develop national and World Health Organization ( WHO ) guidelines on salt reduction.[1 - 5 ] While conflicting studies are not uncommon in any area of research , [ 6 ] in the case of salt , such studies attract widespread attention in the media ; misinform program leaders , clinicians , and the general public ; and impede program implementation . Such impediments to progress have occurred despite the fact that the design s and methods of studies with paradoxical findings have been criticized by international experts who highlight the fact that the results are not valid.[7 - 9."
" All interventions produced positive effects on  BMD scanning  and  osteoporosis treatment rates  post-fracture . Despite sizeable increases , investigation and treatment rates remain sub-optimal . Long-term compliance with osteoporosis medications needs to be addressed , as the majority of studies reported treatment rates at six-month follow up only . Studies would be more informative if treatment criteria were defined a priori to facilitate underst and ing of whether patients were being treated appropriately and integrated economic analyses would be helpful for informing policy implementation decisions."

"sThis systematic review examines the economic and human costs of  depression  and the potential savings associated with improvement in patient adherence to treatment with antidepressants through the use  of enhanced-care programs .  A MEDLINE search was conducted for papers published on the health economics and costs of depression and compliance , adherence , and persistence .  Compliance data  collected through the  online antidepressant compliance support website iCAN  ( www.ican.co.uk ) were compared with data for  patients with depression  from the IMS Disease Analyzer UK data base . Depression frequently causes  unemployment , absenteeism , and presenteeism  , which results in significantly  reduced productivity . Indirect costs of depression  accounted for more than $ 50 billion , whereas  direct costs  result ed in expenditure of $ 26 billion , in the US in 2000 . Improving patients ' compliance with their antidepressant medication results in  improved outcomes  and  prolongs remission from depression , increasing work productivity  , and thus  reducing overall costs .  The  implementation of remote enhanced-care programs  may improve  compliance  and reduce  overall costs .  Novel methods for delivering  enhanced-care programs  to assist in maintaining compliance have the potential to further reduce  costs  and should be a focus of future research . In conclusion , depression is a common disorder with a high economic impact .  Enhanced-care programs  may lower  costs  associated with depression and improve  patients '  lives."
"sAbstract This paper determines the perceptions of  people diagnosed with osteoarthritis  towards their  conservative management strategies .  A systematic review of the published ( AMED , CINAHL , EMBASE , PsychINFO , SportsDisc , MEDLINE , Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry , PubMed ) and unpublished/trial registry data bases ( WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform , Current Controlled Trials , the United States National Institute of Health Trials Registry , NIHR Clinical Research Portfolio Data base ) search ed  from their inception to July 2013 .  Eligible studies included those which presented the  attitudes  or  perceptions  of  people with osteoarthritis  towards  non-operative management strategies .   Study  quality was appraised using the CASP and the Gough ’s weight of evidence appraisal tools . Data were analysed through a meta-ethnography approach .  Thirty-three studies including 1,314 people with osteoarthritis were sample d ; the majority diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis .  The overarching themes indicated people with osteoarthritis delay their diagnosis , opting for self-management and informal information gathering . This informal rather than health professional-led guidance is sought and maintained as an important re source throughout the care of this population and is valued . Diagnosis is sought at a ‘ critical point ’ . Healthcare interventions largely provided are poorly perceived . The period of subsequent  self-management  is an expectation before the inevitable requirement for joint replacement . There remains uncertainty regarding when this is required , but the expected failure of conservative treatment to  manage pain and symptoms  is common . In conclusion , patients should be enthused towards the principles of self-management and clinicians should not trivialise osteoarthritis . This may provide a more valuable perception of  non-operative management  to promote its adoption and adherence in managing osteoarthritis."
"8Background The body of evidence related to the effect of  physical activity monitor-based interventions  has grown over the recent years . However , the effect of  physical activity monitor-based interventions  in  older adults  remains unclear and should be systematic ally review ed . Objective The objective of this systematic review was to estimate the effect of  physical activity monitor-based interventions  on  physical activity behavior   in participants aged 65 and above .  Subsequently we explored the effect on  body mass index , physical capacity  , and  health-related quality of life  and finally the impact of patient- and intervention characteristics . Methods Search es in MEDLINE , EMBASE , SPORTD iscus , CINAHL , and CENTRAL were performed on April 26 , 2018 . No publication date filters were applied . References of eligible studies were scrutinized and relevant journals were h and - search ed . R and omized controlled trials and r and omized cross-over trials investigating the effect of a  physical activity monitor-based intervention  on physical activity were included .  Studies were included if the mean age of the participants was above 65 years , and participants could walk independently with or without walking aids .  The Cochrane h and book was used as a template for extracting data and the RoB 2.0 tool was used to assess risk of bias . R and om-effects meta- analysis using Hedges g , were used to pool the study results . The main outcome of this study was  physical activity .  Results  Twenty-one studies with 2783 participants were included . The median participant age in the studies was 70.5 years , the median percentage of male participants was 42 % , and the median baseline daily step count was 5268  .  Physical activity monitor-based interventions  had a  moderate effect  ( SMD = 0.54 , 95 % CI : 0.34 to 0.73 ) compared to  control interventions  , corresponding to an average increase of 1297 steps per day in the intervention groups . No impact of patient and intervention characteristics on the effect estimates were found . Short conclusion Low quality of evidence was found for a moderate effect of  physical activity monitor-based interventions  on physical activity compared with  control interventions .  More studies with higher research methodology st and ards are required . PROSPERO registration CRD42018083648."
"eThe development of urethral  stricture  ( US ) or bladder neck contracture is a relatively uncommon but well described condition observed primarily in  men .  Despite familiarity with US disease , management remains challenging for urologists . Risk factors for the development of USs or bladder neck contracture include primary treatment modality , tobacco smoking , coronary artery disease and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus . Numerous treatment options exist for this condition that vary in procedural complexity , including   intermittent self catheterization ( CIC ) , serial urethral dilation , endoscopic techniques and open reconstructive repairs .   Repetitive procedures for this condition may carry increased  failure rates and morbidities .  For the treatment of refractory or recalcitrant bladder neck contracture , newer intralesional anti-proliferative , anti-scar agents have been used in combination with transurethral bladder neck incisions to augment  outcome  and  long-term effect  . The primary focus of this systematic review of the published literature is to streamline and summarize various and newer therapeutic modalities available to manage patients with US or bladder neck contracture."

"sFlaxseed  consumption  may be inversely associated with  obesity ;  however , findings of available r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) are conflicting . The present study aim ed to systematic ally review and analyse RCTs assessing the effects of  flaxseed consumption  on  body weight and body composition .  PubMed , Medline via Ovid , SCOPUS , EMBASE and ISI Web of Sciences data bases were search ed up to November 2016 . Mean changes in  body composition indices including body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumference  were extracted . Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference ( WMD ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) . Heterogeneity between studies was assessed with the I2 test . Publication bias and subgroup analyses were also performed . The quality of articles was assessed via the Jadad scale .  A total of 45 RCTs were included .  Meta-analyses suggested a significant  reduction in body weight  ( WMD : -0.99 kg , 95 % CI : -1.67 , -0.31 , p =  0.004 ) ,  BMI ( WMD : -0.30 kg m-2 , 95 % CI : -0.53 , -0.08 , p = 0.008 )  and waist  circumference ( WMD : -0.80 cm , 95 % CI : -1.40 , -0.20 , p = 0.008 )  following  flaxseed supplementation . Subgroup analyses showed that  using whole flaxseed  in doses ≥30 g d-1 , longer-term interventions ( ≥12 weeks ) and studies including participants with higher BMI ( ≥ 27 kg m-2 ) had  positive effects on body composition   . Whole flaxseed  is a good choice for weight management particularly  for weight reduction  in overweight and obese participants."
"tBackground sarcopenia in ageing is a progressive decrease in muscle mass , strength and /or physical function . This review aims to summarise the definitions of sarcopenia in  community-dwelling older adults  and explore similarities and differences in prevalence estimates by definition . Methods a systematic review was conducted to identify articles which estimated  sarcopenia prevalence in older population s  using search terms for sarcopenia and muscle mass . Overall prevalence for each sarcopenia definition was estimated stratified by sex and ethnicity . Secondary analyses explored differences between studies and within definitions , including  participant age  ,  muscle  mass measurement techniques and thresholds for muscle mass and gait speed . Results in  109 included articles , eight  definitions of sarcopenia were identified . The lowest  pooled prevalence estimates  came from the European Working Group on Sarcopenia/Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia ( 12.9 % , 95 % confidence interval : 9.9 - 15.9 % ) , International Working Group on Sarcopenia ( 9.9 % , 3.2 - 16.6 % ) and Foundation for the National Institutes of Health ( 18.6 % , 11.8 - 25.5 % ) definitions . The highest prevalence estimates were for the  appendicular lean mass (ALM)/weight  ( 40.4 % , 19.5 - 61.2 % ) , ALM/height ( 30.4 % , 20.4 - 40.3 % ) , ALM regressed on  height and weight  ( 30.4 % , 20.4 - 40.3 % ) and ALM  / body mass index  ( 24.2 % , 18.3 - 30.1 % ) definitions . Within definitions , the age of study participants and the muscle mass cut points used were substantive sources of between- study differences . Conclusion estimates of  sarcopenia prevalence  vary from 9.9 to 40.4 % , depending on the definition used . Significant differences in prevalence exist within definitions across population s. This lack of agreement between definitions needs to be better understood before sarcopenia can be appropriately used in a clinical context."

Results  Six RCTs ( 462 patients ) comparing three  different interventions fulfilled the inclusion criteria . A low risk of bias was shown for the majority of the study items . The results of NMA showed that compared with  antimuscarinic drugs  , Parasacral transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was associated with significant improvement in  the MVV  ( mean difference [ MD ] = 58.50 , 95 % confidential interval [ CI ] : 45.95–69.52 ) , followed by urotherapy group ( MD = 21.03 , 95 % CI : 11.85–29.97 ) . When it comes to  the constipation  ,  antimuscarinic drugs  exerted significant benefit than PTENS ( odds ratio [ OR ] : 0.22 , 95 % CI : 0.01–0.46 ) . No significant difference was found between other treatments . Conclusion Compared with  antimuscarinic drugs  , PTENS was associated with significant better  efficacy  considering MVV , but more constipation events in de novo OAB children  . Antimuscarinic drugs  showed remarkably better efficacy considering MVV and comparable safety profile compared with urotherapy . Clinicians should take all known safety and compliance of patients into account when choosing an optimal strategy."
"]QUESTION What is the effect of  exercise  on increasing  participation and activity levels  and reducing  impairment  in the  rehabilitation of people with upper limb fractures  ? DESIGN Systematic review of controlled trials . PARTICIPANTS  Adults following an upper limb fracture .  INTERVENTION  Any exercise therapy program  , including trials where  exercise  was delivered to both groups provided that the groups received  different amounts of exercise .  OUTCOME MEASURES  Impairments of body structure and function , activity limitations and participation restrictions .  RESULTS  Twenty-two trials were identified that evaluated 1299 participants with an upper limb fracture .  There was insufficient evidence from 13 trials to support or refute the effectiveness of  home exercise therapy  compared with  therapist-supervised exercise or therapy that included exercise  following distal radius or proximal humeral fractures . There was insufficient evidence from three trials to support or refute the effectiveness of  exercise therapy  compared with  advice/no exercise intervention  following distal radius fracture . There was moderate evidence from five trials ( one examining distal radius fracture , one radial head fracture , and three proximal humeral fracture ) to support commencing  exercise  early and reducing  immobilisation  in improving  activity during upper limb rehabilitation  compared with delayed  exercise  and  mobilisation .  There was preliminary evidence from one trial that exercise to the non-injured arm during immobilisation might lead to short-term benefits on increasing  grip strength and range of movement  following distal radius fracture . Less than 40 % of included trials reported adequate  exercise  program descriptions to allow replication according to the TIDieR checklist .  There is emerging evidence that current  prescribed exercise regimens  may not be effective in  reducing impairments and improving activity  following an upper limb fracture . Starting  exercise  early combined with a shorter immobilisation period is more effective than starting  exercise  after a longer immobilisation period . REGISTRATION CRD42016041818 .

"tSport is a promising setting for obesity prevention among  youth  , but little is known about whether it prevents  obesity .  We review ed research comparing   sport participants  with non participants on weight status  ,   physical   activity , and diet  .  Among  19 studies  , we found no clear pattern of association between  body weight  and sport  participation  . Among  17 studies  , we found  that sport participants are more  physically active  than those who do not participate .  We found  seven studies  that compared the  diet of  sport participants  with  non- participants .   These studies reported that youth involved in sport were more likely to consume  fruits , vegetables , and milk  , and also more likely to eat fast food and drink sugar-sweetened beverages and consume more calories overall . It is unclear from these results whether sports programs , as currently offered , protect  youth  from  becoming overweight or obese .  Additional research may foster underst and ing about how sport , and youth sport setting s , can help promote energy balance and healthy body weight."

"sBACKGROUND The current meta- analysis evaluated the outcomes of various  lifestyle interventions  ,  including diet modifications ( DIET ) , physical activity ( PA ) , and patient education ( EDU )  in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in  patients with type 2 diabetes .  METHODS R and omized clinical trials comparing  lifestyle intervention  with  "" usual care "" ( control )  in  type 2 diabetes patients  were h and - search ed from medical data bases by two independent review ers using the terms "" diabetes , cardiovascular risk , lifestyle , health education , dietary  ,  exercise/physical  activities  , and  behavior  intervention "" . RESULTS Of the  235 studies identified , 17 were chosen for the meta- analysis . The average age of patients ranged from 50 - 67.3 years .  Results reveal no significant difference between the groups , with respect to  BMI  , while PA and DIET yielded a greater reduction in  HbA1c .  Significant reduction in both  systolic and diastolic pressures  in the DIET group , and  diastolic pressure  in the PA group , was observed .  HDL-c  in the DIET group was significantly higher than the control group , while no change in  LDL-c levels  , was seen in all three intervention subtypes . There was no difference between the  EDU  vs. the control group in terms of  HbA1c , blood pressure or HDL-c and LDL-c .    DIET intervention  showed an improvement in  HbA1c , systolic/diastolic blood pressure and HDL-c  , with an exception of  LDL-c and BMI  , suggesting that  nutritional intervention  had a significant impact on the  quality of life  by reducing the cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients."
"dBackground : Assessment of  patient satisfaction with  orthosis   is a key point for clinical practice and research , requiring question naires with robust psychometric properties . Objectives : To identify which vali date d question naires are used to investigate  patient satisfaction with  orthosis in limb orthotics   and to analyse ( 1 ) their main fields of clinical application , ( 2 ) the orthosis-related features analysed by the question naires and ( 3 ) the strength of their psychometric properties . Study design : Systematic review . Methods : A literature search using MEDLINE ( PubMed ) , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) and Scopus data bases for original articles published within the last 20 years was performed . Results :  A total of 106 papers pertaining to various clinical fields were selected .  The main features of  patient satisfaction  with  orthosis  analysed were as follows :  aesthetic , ease in donning and doffing the device , time of orthotic use and comfort .  Conclusion : Of the question naires used to investigate patient satisfaction with orthosis , only four are adequately vali date d for this purpose : two for generic orthotic use ( Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology 2.0 and Client Satisfaction with Device of Orthotics and Prosthetic Users ’ Survey ) and two for specific application with orthopaedic shoes ( Question naire for the Usability Evaluation of orthopaedic shoes and Monitor Orthopaedic Shoes ) . Further development , refinement and validation of outcome measures in this field are warranted . Clinical relevance Given the importance of analysing  patient satisfaction with orthosis  ( PSwO ) , appropriate instruments to assess outcome are needed . This article review s the currently available instruments and reflects on how future studies could be focused on the development , refinement and validation of outcome measures in this field."
"dINTRODUCTION : Against a background of concern about the safety of new pharmaceutical products , there has been renewed interest in one of the oldest antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) ,  phenobarbital .  Although still in widespread use in developing countries , its popularity has slipped in Western countries over the past century , partly because of controversy about its adverse effect profile . This critical review examines the evidence supporting its effectiveness and its associated  behavioural adverse effects  for  febrile convulsions and childhood epilepsy .  METHODS :  Relevant r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs )  of  phenobarbital vs  other  antiepileptic drugs or placebo   between 1970 - 2005  were identified through a comprehensive manual and computer data base search of the world biomedical literature .  Eleven RCTs of febrile convulsions and nine RCTs of childhood epilepsy  were systematic ally review ed against a conventional set of quality criteria . RESULTS : With a few exceptions , the overall quality of clinical trial methodology , especially in the early studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s , was poor . There is no evidence for a difference in  antiepileptic efficacy  between phenobarbital and any other compared AED , yet no evidence for absolute efficacy . No convincing evidence exists for an excess of  behavioural adverse effects  , over other AEDs , attributable to phenobarbital . Masked studies of  phenobarbital  in  childhood epilepsy  have shown no significant differences in  behavioural or cognitive adverse effects  compared to other AEDs . This is in contrast to the excess of such adverse  effects  reported in studies open to observer bias . However , the one finding of reduction in  cognitive ability  associated with  phenobarbital  treatment for febrile convulsions remains a concern . Future areas of clinical and genetic epidemiological research are outlined."
"eSeveral studies have demonstrated the neuromodulating function of  oxytocin (  OT  )  in response to anxiogenic stimuli as well as its potential role in the pathogenesis of depression . Consequently ,  intranasal OT ( IN-OT )  has been proposed as a potential treatment of   anxiety and depressive disorders .   The present systematic review aim ed to summarize the r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the effect of  IN-OT  on  anxiety  and depressive  symptoms .  Overall ,  15 studies were included , involving patients with social anxiety disorders ( 7 studies ) ,  arachnophobia  ( 1 ) , major depression ( 3 ) or post-natal depression ( 4 ) , and mainly evaluating single-dose administrations  of IN-OT .   Results showed no significant effects on  core symptomatology .  Five crossover studies included functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation : one trial showed  reduced amygdala hyper-reactivity  after  IN-OT  in  subjects  with anxiety , while another one showed  enhanced connectivity between amygdala and bilateral insula and middle cingulate gyrus  after  IN-OT  in patients but not in healthy controls . More studies are needed to confirm these results . In conclusion , up to date , evidence regarding the potential utility of  IN-OT  in treating  anxiety and depression  is still inconclusive . Further RCTs with larger sample s and long-term administration of  IN-OT  are needed to better eluci date its potential efficacy alone or in association with st and ard care."
"sOBJECTIVES The global burden of low back pain is the highest ranked condition contributing to years of living with disability .  Exercise  is moderately effective , and  adherence  to  exercise  may improve if participants are engaged . Identification of elements that enhance engagement would enable clinicians to prescribe appropriate interventions . The review objective was to identify and synthesize qualitative empirical studies that have explored beliefs about  exercise therapy  of  people with nonspecific chronic low back pain .  METHODS Two independent review ers conducted a structured review and meta synthesis informed by Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA statement .  Fifteen papers  were included for data extraction , method quality assessment , and thematic analysis . RESULTS Four key themes emerged : ( 1 )  perceptions and classification of exercise ;  ( 2 )  role and impact of the health professional ;  ( 3 )  exercise and activity enablers/facilitators ;  ( 4 )  exercise and activity barriers .  Participants believed that there were distinctions between general activity , real/fitness exercise , and medical exercise . Levels of acquired skills and capability and participant experience with exercise culture require consideration in program design . People participating in  exercise classes and group work  may be more comfortable when matched for abilities and experience . When an intervention interferes with everyday life and appears to be ineffective or too difficult to implement , people make a reasoned decision to discontinue . DISCUSSION People are likely to prefer and participate in  exercise or training programs  and activities that are design ed with consideration of their preferences , circumstances , fitness levels , and exercise experiences."
"sThe purpose of this systematic review was to determine whether  smear layer removal  reduces leakage of  obturated human teeth  in vitro . PubMed was search ed for  articles published between 1975 and 2005  , and results were categorized based on the method of leakage test . Among  26 eligible papers with 65 comparisons  , 53.8 % of the comparisons reported no significant difference , 41.5 % reported a difference in favor of removing the smear layer , and 4.7 % reported a difference in favor of keeping it ; differences were significant ( p<0.001 ) . Of the 65 comparisons , 44 used the   dye leakage test   for evaluation . The combined effect in this group showed  smear layer removal  decreases  dye leakage  ( z-score=0.37 , z=2.31 , p=0.021 ) . According to meta-regression ,  obturation type , test site and duration , sealer and dye , and publication year  had no effect on the results . Under the conditions of these in vitro leakage studies , it is concluded that  smear layer removal  improves the  fluid-tight seal of the root canal system  whereas other factors such as the obturation technique or the sealer , did not produce significant effects."
"nBACKGROUND There is no vali date d assessment of an  older person 's   risk of falling  that is easily applied in primary care . We aim ed to develop a two-part tool for use in primary care or the community . Part 1 includes a rapid assessment of the individual 's risk of falling for administration by clinical or non- clinical staff . Part 2 ( for clinical staff ) includes guidance on further assessment , referral and interventions . We assessed the predictive validity of part 1 . METHODS The tool was developed by an expert panel following the updating of an existing systematic review of community-based prospect i ve studies identifying risk factors for falling and modified in accordance with the feedback from extensive piloting . We assessed predictive validity by a question naire survey sent at baseline and 6 months to a  r and om sample of 1000 people aged over 65 in one Primary Care Group area .  RESULTS Five items were included in part 1 :  history of any fall in the previous year , four or more prescribed medications , diagnosis of stroke or Parkinson 's disease , reported problems with balance , inability to rise from a chair without using arms .  The presence of three or more risk factors had a  positive predictive value for a fall in the next 6 months  of 0.57 ( 95 per cent confidence interval 0.43 - 0.69 ) . Less than three risk factors had a  negative predictive value  of 0.86 ( 0.82 - 0.89 ) , and a  specificity  of 0.92 ( 0.88 - 0.94 ) .  The tool may be useful for identifying  people who would  benefit from further assessment of their  risk  of  falling  and appropriate intervention."
  Antihypertensive drugs  used in the treatment of adults ( primary prevention ) with  mild hypertension  ( systolic BP 140 - 159 mmHg  and  /or diastolic BP 90 - 99 mmHg ) have not been shown to reduce  mortality or morbidity  in RCTs . Treatment caused 9 % of patients to discontinue treatment due to adverse effects . More RCTs are needed in this prevalent population to know whether the benefits of treatment exceed the harms.
"sBackground :  Endothelial function ( EF )  and  arterial stiffness ( AS )  are predictors of  cardiovascular disease .  As previous research concerning the effect of coffee intake on EF and AS was controversial , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to synthesize research . Methods : We performed a systematic search in PubMed , Scopus and Web of Science to find clinical trials investigating the  effect of  coffee intake  on  EF  or AS up to March 2020.R  and om-effects models were used to estimate the  pooled weighted mean difference ( WMD )  between intervention and control groups for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Between study heterogeneity was estimated using Cochran 's Q and the I2-inconsistency index . Internal validity of included r and omized trials was determined with the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool for assessing the risk of bias . Results :  Twenty-three articles were included  for qualitative  and 11 articles  for quantitative synthesis . Meta- analysis of 14 RCTs ( nine articles ) indicated a positive  short-term ( postpr and ial ) effect  of coffee intake on  flow-mediated dilation ( FMD )  as a measure of  EF  ( WMD : 1.93%[95 % CI : 1.10 - 2.75 ] ; I2= 97.9 % ) . Meta- analysis of three long-term RCTs ( two articles ) found no such effect on  FMD  ( WMD : -0.08 % [ -3.82 to 3.66 ] ; I2= 61.4%).Most short-term information was from studies at low or unclear risk of bias , while the proportion of long-term information from studies at high risk of bias was considerable . Conclusion : The results from this meta- analysis suggest a beneficial short-term effect of coffee intake on  EF  as measured by FMD . Base on systematic review results acute and chronic intake of coffee products may exerts an unfavorable effect on  AS .  While we found no such effect concerning long-term coffee intake , this latter finding must be interpreted cautiously as the number of studies were low and included studies had a considerable risk of bias."
"sStudies on the effect of the  Nordic diet ( ND )  on  body weight and adiposity indices  were conflicting . This study targeted to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled clinical trials ( RCTs ) examined the effect of the  ND  on  body weight  and  composition .  PubMed , Scopus , ISI web of Science , ProQuest and Google Scholar were search ed for the eligible studies up to August 2019 . The  weighted mean  difference  ( WMD  ) in  body weight and composition indices  between the ND and control groups/periods was derived using r and om-effects model . In total ,  seven studies ( n = 774 participants ) were included in the present study .  Five studies had illustrated the effect of the  ND  on  weight  , three on  waist circumference ( WC )  , two on  body fat  , and two on  body mass index ( BMI ) .  The pooled analysis of eligible trials showed that those adhered to the ND lost 1.83 kg [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) − 2.94 , − 0.73 , P = 0.001 ]  more weight  compared to controls . Qualitative  assessment of other anthropometric indices  also showed a beneficial effect of this dietary pattern  in improving body fat and BMI values ;  however , these findings are not conclusive because of limited number of  studies .  Adherence to  the ND   significantly improves body weight ;  however , there is also no certainty that this diet is effective for  improving other anthropometric indices .  Future studies regarding the effect of the  ND   on weight and body composition  in population s other than Nordic population s are highly recommended .

"3Reaction  time ( RT ) deficits  are reported following concussion , but it is unknown when these deficits normalize to pre-injury status . It is also unclear how factors such as RT measurement technique and participant characteristics influence post-concussion RT . The purpose of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to ( 1 ) characterize acute  post-concussion  ( 0–3 days  )  RT impairments , ( 2 ) examine RT recovery over time , and ( 3 ) explore moderating factors related to acute RT impairment following concussion . Data base search es ( PubMed , CINAHL , EBSCOhost ) were conducted according to PRISMA guidelines for articles published in English from January 2002 to March 2019 . Studies compared baseline-to-post-injury  RT within  individuals  (  within-subject )   and /or   RT  in  concussed individuals to non-concussed controls  ( between-subject ) . Sixty studies met inclusion criteria , reporting on a total of 9688 participants with 214 discrete RT effects ( Hedges ’ d ; between-subject : N = 29 , k = 129 ; within-subject : N = 42 , k = 85 ) .  Of the 214 effects ,  93  occurred in the acute ( 0–3 days )  post-injury timeframe  ( k = 47 between-subject ) . Numerous demographic [ sex , age , concussion history , population type ( athlete , military , and general population ) , athlete level ( high school , college ) , and sport ] , and method -based ( RT test and measure type , computerized neurocognitive testing platform , concussion definition , and time post-injury ) moderators were examined for mean effect influence . Mixed-effects multi-level modeling with restricted-maximum-likelihood estimation was used to account for nested effects and high heterogeneity for the pooled effect size ( D+ ) .  Significant medium-magnitude RT deficits  were observed acutely for between- ( D+ = − 0.7279 , 95 % CI − 0.9919 , − 0.4639 , I2 = 88.66 , p < 0.0001 ) and within-subject ( D+ = − 0.7472 , 95 % CI − 0.9089 , − 0.5855 , I2 = 89.21 , p < 0.0001 ) effect models  . RT deficits  were present at the sub-acute and intermediate-term timeframes for between-subject effects ( sub-acute : D+ = − 0.5655 , 95 % CI − 0.6958 , − 0.4352 , p < 0.0001 ; intermediate-term : D+ = − 0.3219 , 95 % CI − 0.5988 , − 0.0450 , p =  0.0245  ) . No  significant RT mean effect  was observed for the between-subject model at the long-term timeframe , indicating RT recovery among concussed participants relative to controls ( D+ = 0.3505 , 95 % CI − 0.4787 , 1.1797 , p = 0.3639 ) . Sex was a significant moderator for between-subject effects , with every 1 % male sample size increase demonstrating − 0.0171 ( 95 % CI − 0.0312 , − 0.0029 , p = 0.0193 )  larger RT deficits  . Within-subject effect models result ed in RT measure type ( simple : [ D+ = − 0.9826 ] vs. mixed : [ D+ = − 0.6557 ] , p = 0.0438 ) and computerized neurocognitive testing platforms ( ANAM : [ D+ = − 0.3735 ] vs. HeadMinder CRI : [ D+ = − 1.4799 ] vs. ImPACT : [ D+ = − 0.6749 ] , p = 0.0004 ) having significantly  different  RT-deficit magnitudes . No other moderators produced significantly  different RT-deficit magnitudes  ( between-subject : [ p ≥ 0.0763 ] , within-subject : [ p ≥ 0.1723 ] )  . Robust RT deficits  were observed acutely following concussion . Minimal magnitude differences were noted when comparing between- and within-subject effects , suggesting that pre-injury baselines may not add clinical value in determining post-injury RT impairment .  RT deficits  persisted up till the intermediate-term ( 21–59 days post-injury ) timeframe and indicate lingering deficits exist  . Mean effect size differences  were observed between RT measure types and computerized neurocognitive testing platforms ; however , all categories displayed negative effects consistent with impaired RT following concussion . Clinical interpretation suggests that measuring RT post-concussion is more important than considering the RT method employed so long as reliable and valid tools are used .

"sBalneotherapy is appreciated as a traditional treatment modality in medicine . Hungary is rich in thermal mineral waters .  Balneotherapy  has been in extensive use for centuries and its effects have been studied in detail . Here , we present a systematic review and meta- analysis of clinical trials conducted with  Hungarian  thermal mineral waters   , the findings of which have been published by Hungarian authors in English .  The 122 studies identified in different data bases include 18 clinical trials .  Five of these evaluated the effect of  hydro- and balneotherapy  on  chronic low back pain  , four on  osteoarthritis of the knee  , and two on   osteoarthritis of the h and .   One of the remaining seven trials evaluated  balneotherapy  in chronic inflammatory pelvic diseases , while six studies explored its effect on various laboratory parameters . Out of the 18 studies , 9 met the predefined criteria for meta- analysis . The results confirmed the  beneficial effect of  balneotherapy  on pain with weight bearing and at rest  in  patients with degenerative joint and spinal diseases .  A similar effect has been found in chronic pelvic inflammatory disease . The review also revealed that   balneotherapy  has some beneficial effects on antioxidant status , and on metabolic and inflammatory parameters .  Based on the results , we conclude that  balneotherapy with Hungarian thermal-mineral waters  is an  effective  remedy for   lower back pain   , as well as for knee and h and osteoarthritis."

"nQUESTION Does  mechanically assisted walking with body weight support  result in more  independent walking  and is it detrimental to walking speed or capacity in  non-ambulatory patients early after stroke  ? DESIGN Systematic review with meta- analysis of r and omised trials . PARTICIPANTS  Non-ambulatory adult patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation up to 3 months after stroke .  INTERVENTION  Mechanically assisted walking ( eg , treadmill , electromechanical gait trainer , robotic device , servo-motor ) with body weight support ( eg , harness with or without h and rail , but not h and rail alone ) versus assisted overground walking of longer than 15 min duration .  OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the  proportion of participants achieving independent walking .  Secondary outcomes were  walking speed measured as m/s during the 10-m Walk Test and walking capacity measured as distance in m during the 6-min Walk Test .  RESULTS  Six studies comprising 549 participants were identified  and included in meta-analyses .  Mechanically assisted walking with body weight support  result ed in more people  walking independently  at 4 weeks ( RD 0.23 , 95 % CI 0.15 to 0.30 ) and at 6 months ( RD 0.23 , 95 % CI 0.07 to 0.39 ) ,  faster walking  at 6 months ( MD 0.12 m/s , 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.21 ) , and further  walking  at 6 months ( MD 55 m , 95 % CI 15 to 96 ) than assisted overground walking .   Mechanically assisted walking with body weight support  is more effective than overground walking at increasing independent walking in  non-ambulatory patients early after stroke .  Furthermore , it is not detrimental to walking speed or capacity and clinicians should therefore be confident about implementing this intervention."

"sThe aim of this review was to identify the  effectiveness  of therapies added on to conventional  exercise training  to maximise exercise capacity in  patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .  Electronic data bases were search ed , identifying trials comparing  exercise training with exercise training plus "" add-on "" therapy .  Outcomes included  peak oxygen uptake ( V'O2peak ) , work rate and incremental/endurance cycle and field walking tests .  Individual trial effects on  exercise capacity  were extracted and collated into eight subgroups and pooled for meta- analysis . Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the stability of effect estimates across studies employing patient-centred design s and those deemed to be of "" high "" quality ( PEDro score > 5 out of 10 ) .  74 studies ( 2506 subjects ) met review inclusion criteria .  Interventions spanned a broad scope of clinical practice and were most commonly evaluated via the  6-min walking distance and V'O2peak .  Meta- analysis revealed few clinical ly relevant and statistically significant benefits of "" add-on "" therapies on exercise performance compared with  exercise training .  Benefits favouring "" add-on "" therapies were observed across six different interventions  ( additional  exercise training , noninvasive ventilation , bronchodilator therapy , growth hormone , vitamin D and nutritional supplementation )   . The sensitivity analyses included considerably fewer studies , but revealed minimal differences to the primary analysis . The lack of systematic benefits of "" add-on "" interventions is a probable reflection of method ological limitations , such as "" one size fits all "" eligibility criteria , that are inherent in many of the included studies of "" add-on "" therapies . Future clarification regarding the exact value of such therapies may only arise from adequately powered , multicentre clinical trials of tailored interventions for carefully selected  COPD patient  subgroups defined according to distinct clinical phenotypes."

"eSummary  Back schools  are high frequency-low cost interventions . Their effectiveness has lately been regarded with skepticism . The variety of  back school  programs makes an  over-all evaluation  difficult . The number of evaluative publications has increased dramatically during the last 10 years , including  18 r and omized controlled trials .  Results of these studies have been contradictory . The results of two lately published r and omized controlled trials , of  18 r and omized  controlled trials , of  five  systematic review s , two publications conducting metaanalyses , and five task forces presenting guidelines for clinical practice are reported . According to the conclusions of the review s there is limited to strong evidence for the effectiveness of  back schools  for  chronic back pain .  The metaanalyses show clear effects for  knowledge and behavior change  up to 6 months . Three of five task forces recommend  back schools  for acute pain respectively at worksite . Summarizing the results of the given evidence based recommendations it is concluded that  back schools  at work sites and back schools with intensive training is effective . There is still need to prove the effectiveness of single elements of the  back school  programs , of strategies to increase long term  effects  , the effectiveness for subtypes of patients and the effectiveness of  back  schools as part of a comprehensive orthopedic pain therapy . ZusammenfassungRückenschulen sind inzwischen weit verbreitete Programme , deren Wirksamkeit in letzter Zeit kritisch diskutiert wurde . Die Heterogenität der Programme i m Hinblick auf Ziele , Inhalte und Vermittlungsformen erschweren allgemeine Aussagen zur Wirksamkeit . Es liegt eine nahezu unüberschaubare Anzahl an Publikationen zur Evaluation von Rückenschulen vor , die unterschiedliche Wirksamkeitskriterien erhoben haben . Die vorliegenden Einzelstudien , darunter 18 mit einem kontrollierten r and omisierten Versuchsplan , kommen zu teilweise widersprechenden Result aten . Um dennoch zu einer allgemeinen Bewertung der Ergebnislage zu kommen , werden 2 jüngere Einzelstudien exemplarisch beschrieben , ebenso wie eine Übersicht über 18 r and omisierte kontrollierte Studien , Schlußfolgerungen von 5 Sammelreferaten , 2 Metaananalysen und 5 Expertenkommissionen , die „ Evidence based-Leitlinien “ zur Beh and lung von Rückenbeschwerden veröffentlichen . Von den Sammelreferaten kommt eines zu keinem Ergebnis , 3 beschreiben eine eingeschränkte Wirksamkeit und eines begründet eine starke Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit von  Rückenschulen  bei chronischen Beschwerden . Eine Metaanalyse errechnet große Effekte für Verhaltensänderungen und Kenntnisgewinn , die and ere größere Effekte für Rückenschulen als Teil von umfassenden Rehabilitationsprogrammen , 2 der Expertenkommissionen sehen keine Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit von  Rückenschulen  , 3 sehen die Wirksamkeit bei akuten Beschwerden bzw . am Arbeitsplatz als erwiesen . In der Gesamtbewertung erscheint die   Wirksamkeit  von Rückenschulprogrammen  gesichert , die am Arbeitsplatz durchgeführt werden und die eine intensive Schulung beinhalten . Darüber hinaus muß die Wirkung der  Rückenschulen  noch deutlicher belegt werden , u. a. die isolierte Wirkung einzelner Bausteine , von Maßnahmen zur Steigerung der Dauerhaftigkeit , der Indikation für bestimmte Patientengruppen und Wirkungen der Rückenschule als Best and teil der Orthopädischen Schmerztherapie."
"0Background Fibromyalgia ( FM ) is characterized by chronic and generalized musculoskeletal pain . There is currently no cure for FM , but palliative treatments are available . One type of treatment is  strength training ( ST ) .  However , there is a need for more information on optimal training protocol s , intensity , and volume needed to improve symptoms . The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of  ST  in the treatment of FM through a systematic review of experimental research . Methods Medical Subject Headings search terms and electronic data bases including Scientific Electronic Library Online , PubMed , Science Direct , Web of Science , and Physiotherapy Evidence Data base were used to identify studies . Results The inclusion criteria were met by  22 eligible studies . Most of the studies were conducted in the United States ( 36 % ) , Finl and ( 23 % ) , Brazil ( 18 % ) , and Sweden ( 18 % ) .  The studies showed that  ST   reduces the number of tender points , fatigue , depression , and anxiety , and improves sleep quality and quality of life  in  patients with FM .  The intervention period ranged from 3 to 21 weeks , with sessions performed 2 times a week in 81.81 % of the studies , at initial intensities of 40 % of 1-repetition maximum . The repetitions ranged from 4 to 20 , with no specific protocol defined for ST in FM . Conclusion The main results included reduction  in pain , fatigue , number of tender points , depression , and anxiety  , with  increased functional capacity and quality of life .  Current evidence demonstrates that  ST  is beneficial and can be used to treat FM.Trial registration CRD42016048480."

"nINTRODUCTION  osteoarthritis ( OA ) of knee  has been reported as a risk factor for  falls  and reduced   balance  in the elderly .  This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of  physical therapies  in improving  balance  and  reducing falls risk  among  patients with knee OA .  METHODS a computerised search was performed to identify relevant studies  up to November 2013 .  Two investigators identified eligible studies and extracted data independently . The quality of the included studies was assessed by the  PeDro score  . RESULTS a total  of 15 r and omised controlled trials involving 1482 patients were identified .  The  mean PeDro score  was 7 . The pooled  st and ardised mean difference in balance outcome   for strength training  = 0.3346 ( 95 % CI : 0.3207 - 0.60 , P = 0.01 < 0.00001 , P for heterogeneity = 0.85 , I(2 ) = 0 % ) .  Tai Chi  = 0.7597 ( 95 % CI : 0.5130 - 1.2043 , P<=0.0014 , P for heterogeneity = 0.26 , I(2 ) = 0 % )  and aerobic exercises  = 0.6880 ( 95 % CI : 0.5704 - 1.302 , P < 0.00001 , P for heterogeneity = 0.71 , I(2 ) = 0 % ) . While pooled results for  falls risk  outcomes in  , strength training , Tai chi and aerobics  also showed a significant reduction in  reduced risk of falls  significantly with pooled result 0.55 ( 95 % CI : 0.41 - 0.68 , P < 0.00001 , P for heterogeneity = 0.39 , I(2 ) = 6 % ) .   strength training , Tai Chi and aerobics exercises   improved balance and falls risk  in  older individuals with knee OA  ,  while water-based exercises  and  light treatment  did not significantly improve balance outcomes  . Strength training , Tai Chi and aerobics exercises  can therefore be recommended as falls prevention strategies for individuals with OA . However , a large r and omised controlled study using actual falls outcomes is recommended to determine the appropriate dosage and to measure the potential benefits in falls reduction."
"hBACKGROUND The   6-minute walk test ( 6MWT  )  is a common outcome measurement in cardiac rehabilitation . However , a search of the literature found no established guidelines for use of the  6MWT  in cardiac rehabilitation . OBJECTIVES Systematic review of the  validity  ,  reliability  and  responsiveness  of the  6MWT  in cardiac rehabilitation . DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE , SPORTd iscus , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Review s and Cochrane Clinical Trials  between January 1948 and April 2011 .  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA  Studies using  6MWTs  in subjects with coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac rehabilitation on an outpatient basis , published in English , were included .  STUDY APPRAISAL AND METHODS : Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted , including quality assessment of methodology , meta- analysis and assessment against level of evidence criteria . RESULTS  Fifteen articles met  the inclusion criteria . One high- quality study was identified for reliability , six high- quality studies were identified for validity and 11 high- quality studies were identified for responsiveness . The meta- analysis found strong evidence that  the 6MWT  was responsive to  change  in  clinical status  following cardiac rehabilitation , with an estimated mean  difference  in  6-minute walk distance  of 60.43 m ( 95 % confidence interval 54.57 to 66.30 m ; P<0.001 ) . Qualitative analysis indicated moderate evidence for  repeatability of the 6MWT  in  patients  undergoing cardiac rehabilitation , for a 2 % to 8 %  learning effect  between repeated 6MWTs , for a relationship between  peak heart rate  during the 6MWT and during cycle exercise at the ventilatory threshold , and for moderate-to-high correlation between the  6-minute walk distance  and  maximum metabolic equivalents  achieved on symptom-limited exercise tests . LIMITATIONS Few studies assessed similar aspects of validity for the 6MWT .  Strong evidence suggests that the 6MWT is responsive to clinical change following cardiac rehabilitation . Intra- and intertester reliability of the 6MWT and its validity in  patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation  requires further research."

"yDisease and cancer treatment-related side effects such as decreased  energy level  ,  muscle weakness  , and declines in  functional status  and  body mass  have been well documented . There is evidence that  exercise  , such as  low intensity aerobics walking , Tai Chi , or cycling  , results in an overall decrease in  fatigue levels  over the course of cancer treatment . Additionally , there is evidence that  regular physical activity or exercise  can decrease  emotional stress , blood pressure , the duration of neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , and pain .   Exercise  also has been shown to increase  quality of life and  improve the  maximal oxygen uptake during exertion , sleep patterns , and cognition .  However , the majority of studies of  exercise  and cancer have been conducted with  women with early stage breast cancer  , limiting the generalizability of these studies to other cancer population s. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a synthesis of the extant research evidence about th e benefits of  exercise  related to cancer recovery."
"yBackground   Anterior knee pain  ( AKP ) or patellofemoral pain syndrome  is common and may limit an individual 's ability to perform common activities of daily living such as stair climbing and prolonged sitting . The diagnosis is difficult as there are multiple definitions for this disorder and there are no accepted criteria for diagnosis . It is therefore most commonly a diagnosis that is made once other pathologies have been excluded . Objectives The aim of this study was to create an evidence -based checklist for research ers and clinicians to use for the diagnosis of AKP . Methods A systematic review was conducted in July 2016 , and an evidence -based checklist was created based on the subjective and objective findings most commonly used to diagnose AKP . For the subjective factors , two or more of the systematic review s needed to identify the factor as being important in the diagnosis of AKP . Results Two systematic review s , consisting of nine different diagnostic studies , were identified by our search methods . Diagnosis of AKP is based on the area of pain , age , duration of symptoms , common aggravating factors , manual palpation and exclusion of other pathologies . Of the functional tests ,  squatting  demonstrated the highest sensitivity . Other useful tests include  pain during stair climbing and prolonged sitting .  The cluster of two out of three positive  tests  for  squatting , isometric quadriceps contraction and palpation of the patella borders  and the  patella tilt test  were also recommended as useful tests to include in the clinical assessment . Conclusion A diagnostic checklist is useful as it provides a structured method for diagnosing  AKP  in a clinical setting . Research is needed to establish the causes of AKP as it is difficult to diagnose a condition with unknown aetiology."
" There is no consensus on the level of outcome to be used , the method of measurement to be used , or the most appropriate timing of the assessment . It is recommended that future studies should include  extended/instrumental activities  and  advanced mobility  as components of the primary outcome measure , with outcome assessment being undertaken at 6 months . New initiatives in developing stroke-specific outcomes may address some of the current problems in the assessment of stroke."
" Given the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and the current paucity of evidence on   therapeutic touch   in this population , there is a need for well conducted r and omised controlled trials to examine the  effectiveness of  therapeutic touch   for anxiety disorders."
"  Interventions to promote exercise  in  cancer survivors  who report better levels of  adherence  share some common behaviour change techniques . These involve setting programme goals , prompting practise and self-monitoring and encouraging participants to attempt to generalise behaviours learned in supervised exercise environments to other , non-supervised context s. However , expecting most sedentary survivors to achieve current guideline recommendations of at least 150 minutes per week of  aerobic exercise  is likely to be unrealistic . As with all well- design ed  exercise  programmes in any context , prescriptions should be design ed around individual capabilities , and frequency , duration and intensity or sets  , repetitions  ,  intensity or resistance training  should be generated on this basis."
"  Total cholesterol  is sensitive to pharmacist interventions , while  LDL-C and triglyceride levels  are possibly sensitive to those interventions . Further research is required for these outcomes."
"sThe aim of this review was to recommend  training strategies  that improve the functional capacity in  physically frail older adults  based on scientific literature , focusing specially in  supervised exercise programs  that improved muscle strength , fall risk , balance , and  gait ability .  Scielo , Science Citation Index , MEDLINE , Scopus , Sport Discus , and ScienceDirect data bases were search ed from 1990 to 2012 . Studies must have mentioned the effects of  exercise training  on at least one of the following four parameters :  Incidence of falls , gait , balance , and lower-body strength .   Twenty studies  that investigated the effects of   multi-component exercise training  ( 10  ) ,  resistance training   ( 6  ) ,  endurance training  ( 1 ) , and  balance training  ( 3 ) were included in the present revision . Ten trials investigated the effects of  exercise  on the  incidence of falls  in  elderly with physical frailty .  Seven of them have found a fewer  falls incidence  after physical training when compared with the control group . Eleven trials investigated the effects of  exercise intervention  on the  gait ability .  Six of them showed  enhancements in the gait ability .  Ten trials investigated the effects of  exercise intervention  on the  balance performance  and seven of them demonstrated  enhanced balance .  Thirteen trials investigated the effects of  exercise intervention  on the  muscle strength  and nine of them showed  increases in the muscle strength .  The  multi-component exercise intervention  composed by strength  , endurance and balance training  seems to be the best strategy to improve  rate of falls , gait ability , balance , and strength performance  in physically frail older adults."
"yOBJECTIVE To investigate the  efficacy and safety  of  drug interventions  to promote  motor recovery post-stroke .  DATA SOURCES CENTRAL , CINAHL , Embase , MEDLINE , SCOPUS and Web of Science . STUDY SELECTION Published human  r and omized  controlled trials in which the primary intervention was a  drug administered to promote motor  recovery post-stroke   , vs  placebo .  DATA EXTRACTION St and ardized pro forma used to extract safety and efficacy data ; Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias assessment tool performed to assess risk of bias . DATA SYNTHESIS  Fifty r and omized controlled trials from 4,779 citations were included .  An overall trend of high risk of attrition ( n = 27 ) and reporting bias ( n = 36 ) was observed . Twenty-eight different drug interventions were investigated , 18 of which demonstrated statistically significant results favouring increased  motor recovery  compared with control intervention . Forty-four studies measured  safety ; no major safety concerns  were reported .  C and i date drug interventions promoting motor recovery post-stroke were identified , specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and levodopa  ;  however , the high risk of bias in many trials is concerning . Drugs to improve  motor function  remain an important area of enquiry . Future research must focus on establishing the right drug intervention to be administered at an optimal dose and time , combined with the most effective  adjuvant physical therapy  to drive stroke recovery."
"tR  and omized controlled trials  , being  published in English  and investigating the associations of at least 4 weeks intervention of   citrus and /or its extracts  on  weight loss  among adults  , were search ed from PubMed , Web of Science , Scopus , and Cochrane by June 2019 to conduct a meta- analysis .  Thirteen articles , including 921 participants , were selected  and  evaluated  by modified  Jadad scale .  Pooled results by the r and om-effects model showed that  citrus and /or its extracts  administration significantly reduced 1.280 kg  body weight  ( 95 % CI : -1.818 to -0.741 , p = 0.000 , I2 = 81.4 % ) , 0.322 kg/m2  BMI  ( 95 % CI : -0.599 to -0.046 , p = 0.022 , I2 = 87.0 % ) , 2.185 cm WC ( 95 % CI : -3.804 to -0.566 , p = 0.008 , I2 = 98.3 % ) , and 2.137 cm HC ( 95 % CI : -3.775 to -0.500 , p = 0.011 , I2 = 96.2 % ) , respectively , but no significantly decreased effects  on WHR and body fat  were observed . Subgroup analysis deduced the different effects  of study location , intervention  duration  on body weight associated indices  . No  publication  bias was observed . Our meta- analysis supported the beneficial effects of  citrus and /or its extracts  supplement on  body weight control  , and future well- design ed studies are required to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of  citrus and /or its extracts  intervention on body weight."
"eThe effects of  ruminant ( R ) trans-fatty acids ( TFA )  on the risk of  CVD  are still under debate . It could be argued that the lack of the effect of  R-TFA  may be the result of the small amount of their intake . Taking into consideration the growing available data from intervention studies , we carried out a systematic review and meta-regression to assess the impact of  R-TFA  intake levels on changes in the  total cholesterol : HDL-cholesterol ( TC : HDL-C ) ratio .  A systematic review of the literature was conducted and  thirteen r and omised clinical trials were included , yielding a total of twenty-three independent experimental groups of subjects .  A univariate r and om-effects meta-regression approach was used to quantify the relationship between the dose of  R-TFA  and changes in  the TC : HDL-C ratio .  To consider several potential modifiers such as subject and dietary characteristics , a multivariate regression analysis was performed . We found no relationship between   R-TFA  intake levels  of up to 4.19 % of  daily energy intake ( EI )  and  changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as TC : HDL-C and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C):HDL-C ratios .  In addition , a multivariate regression analysis that included other dietary variables , as well as subject baseline characteristics , confirmed that doses of  R-TFA  did not significantly influence the changes in  the lipid ratio .  Our findings showed that doses of  R-TFA  did not influence the  changes in the ratios of plasma TC : HDL-C and LDL-C : HDL-C.  These data suggest that  TFA  from natural sources , at least at the current levels of intake and up to 4.19 % EI , have no adverse effects on these key CVD risk markers in healthy people."
"kStructured  lifestyle interventions  can reduce diabetes incidence and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk among  persons with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT )  , but it is unclear whether they should be implemented among  persons without IGT .  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess the effectiveness of  lifestyle interventions  on CVD risk  among adults without IGT or diabetes .  We systematic ally search ed MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , Web of Science , the Cochrane Library ,  and PsychInfo data bases  ,  from inception to May 4 , 2016 .  We selected r  and  omized controlled trials  of lifestyle interventions , involving physical activity ( PA ) , dietary ( D ) , or combined strategies ( PA+D )  with follow-up duration ≥12 months . We excluded  all studies that included individuals with IGT , confirmed by 2-hours oral glucose tolerance test ( 75 g ) , but included all other studies recruiting population s with different glycemic levels .  We stratified studies by baseline glycemic levels : ( 1 )  low-range group with mean fasting plasma  glucose  (  FPG ) <  5.5mmol/L or glycated  hemoglobin ( A1C ) <  5.5  % , and ( 2 )  high-range group with FPG  ≥5.5mmol/L  or  A1C ≥5.5 % , and synthesized data using r and om-effects models . Primary outcomes in this review  included systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , and triglycerides ( TG )  . Totally  79 studies met inclusion criteria .  Compared to usual care ( UC ) , lifestyle interventions achieved  significant improvements in  SBP ( -2.16mmHg[95%CI , -2.93 ,  -1.39  ] ) , DBP ( -1.83mmHg[-2.34 ,  -1.31  ]  )  , TC ( -0.10mmol/L[-0.15 ,  -0.05 ] ) ,  LDL-C ( -0.09mmol/L[-0.13 ,  -0.04 ] ) ,  HDL-C ( 0.03mmol/L[0.01 ,  0.04  ]  )  ,  and  TG ( -0.08mmol/L[-0.14 ,  -0.03  ] ) . Similar effects were observed among both low- and high-range study groups  except for TC and  TG .  Similar  effects also appeared  in SBP and DBP  categories regardless of follow-up duration  . PA+D interventions  had larger improvement effects  on CVD risk factors  than  PA alone  interventions . In  adults without IGT or diabetes  , lifestyle interventions result ed in significant improvements in  SBP , DBP , TC , LDL-C , HDL-C , and TG  , and might further reduce CVD risk."
"dOBJECTIVE To develop a guidance document concerning the use of  systemic therapy  for  women with recurrent ovarian cancer  that would be applicable for the  Canadian health care system .  This will be done using a st and ardized systematic review process , guideline evaluation instruments , multi-disciplinary expert consensus opinion and evidence -rating systems . DATA SELECTION The primary data sources were MEDLINE , National Guideline Clearinghouse and Cochrane Library . METHODS Clinical practice guidelines , technology assessment s , systematic review s and r and omized controlled trials addressing  systemic therapy  for  women with recurrent ovarian cancer were eligible .  DATA EXTRACTION Data was identified and extracted by the methodology team and review ed by the authors . Results were review ed and discussed by members of an expert working group comprised of a multidisciplinary and geographic divergent group of practitioners . DATA SYNTHESIS The existing 7 practice guidelines underwent formal evaluation for quality , currency and content using the AGREE tool . Recommendations with evidence -ratings were developed . This data was used by a pan-Canadian panel in an informal consensus process , which result ed in the initial draft of a guideline . The guideline team review ed the draft and made further edits to ensure the guideline 's appropriateness for a national context . Practitioner feedback was requested from  165 health care providers who treat ovarian cancer from across Canada .  Overall  response rate  was 37 % and was very positive . Comments were review ed and the guideline was edited appropriately .  The development of a national practice guideline on the use of systemic therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer was feasible using systematic literature review , expert consensus , guideline evaluation instruments , evidence -rating systems , independent internal and external review measures and final approval by a national discipline specific society ( GOC ) . Recommendations for practice are offered."

" When  digital versions of self-report symptom scales  are compared to  pen and paper versions  , most scales show high  interformat reliability .  This supports the reliability of results obtained in psychotherapy research on the Internet and the comparability of the results to traditional psychotherapy research . There are , however , some instruments that consistently show low  interformat reliability  , suggesting that these conclusions can not be generalized to all question naires . Most studies had at least some method ological issues with insufficient statistical power being the most common issue . Future studies should preferably provide information about the transformation of the instrument into digital format and the procedure for data collection in more detail."
"sBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to assess the effects of  vitamin D supplements  on  indices  of  glycemic control [ homeostatic model assessment -insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C ) , fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) , and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index ( QUICKI ) and lipid profile  in  diabetic patients .  METHODS  Eight data bases  were search ed , for r and  omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) or cross-sectional and cohort studies that have been published up  to December 2017  . We used the comprehensive meta- analysis ( CMA ) software for all statistical analysis and used the I2 index for assessing heterogeneity . A p value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant . RESULTS We found  621 articles ,  and after the exclusion of ineligible publications ,  82 studies remained  to  be assessed  of which  37  were used for meta-  analysis  .  Vitamin D supplementation  was associated with a significant improvement in  FBG  ( p = 0.001 and 95 % CI : -0.526 to -0.136 ) and  HbA1C  ( p = 0.003 and 95 % CI : 1.719 to -0.361 ) in  individuals  with  type 2 diabetes  mellitus ( T2DM ) ; while in  women with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM )  the reduction in FBG ( p = 0.071 and 95 % CI : -0.873 to -0.035 ) and HbA1C ( p = 0.199 and 95 % CI : 3.270 to 0.681 ) failed to reach statistical significance . Treatment  with vitamin D supplements  was associated with an improvement in  HOMA-IR  in pregnant diabetic women ( p = 0.028 and 95 % CI : 0.924 to -0.053 ) and for individuals with diabetes mellitus ( p = 0.005 and 95 % CI : 1.772 to -0.319 ) . The pooled result of the cross-sectional meta- analysis indicated that  serum vitamin D concentrations  were significantly lower in diabetic patients than in healthy controls ( p = 0.018 and 95 % CI : 0.587 to -0.054 ) .  This meta- analysis suggests  that vitamin D supplementation  improves  indices of glycemic control ( FBG , HOMA-IR , and HbA1C )  in  patients with diabetes mellitus .  Hence ,  vitamin D supplements  may be of potential therapeutic value in  diabetic patients  , as an adjuvant therapy along with other treatments."
"tBACKGROUND  Stemless anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty ( TSA )  is used in the treatment of  osteoarthritis of the shoulder joint and other degenerative shoulder diseases .  It has several proposed advantages over  stemmed TSA  including increased bone preservation , decreased operative time , and easier removal at revision . METHODS A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE , Embase , PubMed , and CENTRAL ( Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) to retrieve all relevant studies . RESULTS The literature search yielded  1417 studies , of which 22 were included in this review , with 962 patients undergoing  stemless TSA .  Stemless TSA  led to significant improvements in  range of motion and functional scores  in all included studies . Meta- analysis of comparative studies between  stemless and stemmed TSA  identified no significant differences in  postoperative Constant scores  ( mean difference [ MD ] , 1.26 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -3.29 to 5.81 points ; P = .59 ) or  complication rates  ( odds ratio , 1.79 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 - 4.54 ; P = .22 ) .  Stemless TSA  result ed in a significantly  shorter operative time  compared with  stemmed TSA  ( MD , -15.03 minutes ; 95 % CI , -23.79 to -6.26 minutes ; P = .0008 ) .  Stemless TSA  also result ed in significantly decreased  intraoperative blood loss  compared with  stemmed TSA  ( MD , -96.95 mL ; 95 % CI , -148.53 to -45.36 mL ; P = .0002 ) .   Stemless anatomic TSA  result ed in similar functional outcomes and complication rates to  stemmed TSA  with decreased  operative time  and lower  blood loss .  Further research is required to investigate the long-term durability of the stemless implant."

">Etanercept  ( ETN )  has been widely applied in the treatment of  ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) .  As the use of  ETN  has increased , associated adverse  effects  have been reported frequently . Previous meta-analyses have focused on comparing the differences in clinical outcomes between  ETN  and  placebo  ( PBO ) . The present meta- analysis evaluated r and  omised  controlled trials ( RCTs ) to compare the effects of  ETN and a PBO or sulfasalazine ( SSZ )  in  patients with AS .  The study population characteristics and the main results , including the  Assessment in AS 20 % response ( ASAS 20 )  ,  the Bath AS Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) and the Bath AS Functional Index ( BASFI )  , were extracted . The  pooled odds ratios ( ORs )  or  weighted mean differences ( MDs )  were calculated using a fixed or r and om effects model .  Fifteen r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) involving 2,194 subjects were included .  Compared with a  PBO , ETN  significantly improved the  ASAS 20  [ P<0.00001 ; OR , 8.25 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 5.92 - 11.50 ] ,  BASDAI  ( P<0.00001 ; MD , -18.81 ; 95 % CI , -24.47 to -13.15 ) and  BASFI  ( P<0.00001 ; st and ard MD , -0.68 ; 95 % CI , -0.85 to -0.50 ) . In comparison with  SSZ , ETN  significantly decreased the  BASDAI  ( P<0.00001 ; MD , -2.40 ; 95 % CI , -2.89 to -1.90 ) and  C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels  ( P<0.0001 ; MD , -8.01 ; 95 % CI , -11.73 to -4.29 ) . The most common  adverse effect  of  ETN  was an  injection site reaction .  This meta- analysis shows that  ETN  monotherapy is  effective  in  improving physical function and reducing disease activity  in  patients with AS .  Compared with  SSZ , ETN  markedly decreased  the BASDAI and CRP levels .  However , the efficacy of  ETN  in treating AS requires further evaluation by more RCTs in a larger population of patients prior to recommending  ETN  as a substitute for synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) monotherapy , or combinations of  synthetic DMARDs ."
")The  Indigenous population of Canada  faces an increased burden of chronic disease , leading to decreased life expectancy .  Physical activity  is an important health behaviour that improves chronic disease risk factors and physical fitness . The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate  physical activity interventions  in the  Indigenous population in Canada  to determine effects on  physical activity rates , physical fitness , and health outcomes .  MEDLINE , PsycINFO , EMBASE , and CINAHL were search ed for peer- review ed journal articles . Inclusion criteria were  studies that examined a  physical activity intervention  delivered in Indigenous communities in Canada for adults over 18 years of age .  Data was extracted and two authors independently rated quality of the evidence . Five studies were included in the narrative synthesis . Interventions were  community-based  , and three were  multi-component interventions  focused on preventing or managing type II diabetes . The interventions varied in their success in  altering physical activity rates  , with increases ( n = 2 ) , a decrease ( n = 1 ) , or non-significant changes reported ( n = 2 ) . No study reported any measure of  physical fitness . BMI  was reported in four studies , with only one reporting a significant decrease . Decreases in  systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol  were reported in two studies . There is limited evidence and a lack of robust interventions that examine the impacts of   physical activity  on health and fitness status  in the  Canadian Indigenous population .  Vali date d , culturally relevant tools for measuring  physical  activity may aid in program evaluation and focused educational material s could better support population health initiatives .

To address this question further , a large trial would be required with a sample size sufficient to examine all the important benefits and harms . Adverse outcomes associated with infection should be evaluated , and microbiological studies looking for the development of resistant bacteria should be."
 : The analysis of the information here reported sheds light for the design of future clinical trials in  adults with MS .  The best anthropometric parameters and units of measurement to monitor the interventions are  related to dietary and physical exercise interventions  . A list of practical advice that is easy to implement in daily practice in consultation is here proposed in order to guarantee the best results in  changes of body composition .
" Due to the use of anthropometry when determining body composition , a majority of the studies could not accurately address whether alterations in the fat and /or fat-free mass components of the body were responsible for the observed changes in body composition . The effect of  Zn supplementation  on body composition is not consistent but may modify fat-free mass among children with pre-existing growth failure."
"0INTRODUCTION Iodine is an essential micronutrient and component of the thyroid hormones . Sufficient ingestion of iodine is necessary for normal growth and development . If iodine requirements are not met , growth can be impaired .  Salt iodisation  and  supplementation with iodine  can prevent iodine deficiency disorders and stunted growth . No systematic review has yet collated the evidence linking iodine to growth . With an increased emphasis on stunting within the WHO Global Nutrition Targets for 2025 , we propose a systematic review to address this question . METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will undertake a systematic review , and if appropriate , meta-analyses , evaluating the effects of  iodised salt or iodine supplements  on  prenatal and postnatal somatic growth , until age 18 .  We will search a number of data bases , including MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science , CINAHL , PsychINFO , the Cochrane Library , including the CENTRAL register of Controlled Trials and also the WHO library and ICTRP ( International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ) , which includes the Clinical trials.gov repository . We will also search  Wanfang Data  and the  China Knowledge Re source Integrated  Data base . Included studies must have compared exposure to  iodised salt , iodine supplements or iodised oil , to placebo , non-iodised salt or no intervention .  Primary outcomes will be continuous  and categorical markers of prenatal and postnatal somatic growth .  Secondary outcomes will cover  further measures of growth , including growth rates and indirect markers of growth such as insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) .  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The systematic review will be published in a peer- review ed journal , and will be sent directly to the WHO , United Nations Children 's Fund , International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders and other stakeholders . The results generated from this systematic review will provide evidence to support future programme recommendations regarding iodine fortification or supplementation and child growth .

"sWe have prepared the  Japanese Breast Cancer  Society clinical practice guidelines ( CPGs ) for surgical treatment of  breast  cancer , 2018 up date after a systematic review ( SR ) of the literature based upon the Medical Information Network Distribution Service ( Minds ) procedure . The CPG committee for surgical treatment of breast cancer , composed of breast surgeons and plastic surgeons treating breast cancer , has developed the CPGs . Eight  clinical questions  ( CQs ) were selected and divided roughly into the following five categories :  ( 1 ) breast surgery in initial therapy ( CQs 1 - 3 ) ; ( 2 ) axillary surgery in initial therapy ( CQs 4 - 5 ) ; ( 3 ) breast reconstruction in initial therapy ( CQ 6 ) ; ( 4 )  surgical treatment  for  recurrent and metastatic breast cancer  ( CQs 7 - 8 ) ; and ( 5 ) others  . Recommendations for these CQs were decided by the GRADE grid method . In addition , 4 outlines , 14 background  questions  ( BQs ) , and 12 future research questions ( FQs ) were also selected . Statements for these BQs and FQs are provided . We developed the up date d CPGs for surgical treatment of breast cancer , 2018 , which include 8 CQs and recommendations . As a decision-making tool for the underst and ing and treatment of breast cancer , these guidelines will help surgical oncologists dealing with breast cancer , medical staff , and patients , along with their family members."
"sHighlightsA broad range of domains of  neuropsychological  performance are significantly impaired in studies which have compared   methadone  population  s with the  healthy controls  . However low power , poor quality and heterogenous population s limit the interpretation of these results .Short term ( less than 1 year ) abstinent groups , when compared with  methadone  groups , still exhibited  cognitive impairments  but results are inconclusive . It is still not clear what the role of global sedative effects of opioids such as  methadone  have on  cognitive impairment .  Only higher quality longitudinal studies using ecologically valid cognitive tests , in well‐defined population groups can address this question .Methadone  population  s present with a broad range of  neuropsychological impairment  when compared with healthy controls . Introduction : There is a presumption that neurocognition is commonly impaired in  chronic  methadone  exposed individuals ( CM )  when compared with healthy controls ( HP ) . Additionally , it remains unclear if short term ( < 1 year ) abstinence ( AP ) is associated with an  altered cognitive profile  when compared with CM . Method : A r and om effect model approach was used on data assembled into the Comprehensive Meta‐ Analysis programme .  Cohen 's d  effect sizes and a significance levels of p < 0.01 were calculated for each domain . Results : Data from a  total cohort of 1063 CM , 412 AP and 879 HP participants , from 23 independent studies   indicate global impairments in neurocognitive function  in CM relative to HP participants . The smaller body of evidence comparing CM to AP participants is inconclusive . Conclusion : Method ological issues such as small sample sizes , heterogeneity and poor quality limited the interpretation of the results and does not address whether the observed impairments reflect co‐morbid functioning , methadone‐related sedation and /or other factors . Only higher quality longitudinal studies will permit confident interpretation of the results observed in this meta‐ analysis."
"sThe purpose of this review was to confirm a volumetric dilution of  vitamin D  in  obesity .  It was based on the hypothesis that weight loss , particularly fat loss , would increase  serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD )  in  the obese .  We conducted a systematic review of the literature over the last 21 years and included  human trials  that reported changes  in 25OHD , weight , or body composition  after weight loss . Study arms were excluded if   vitamin D  was supplemented , dietary intake exceeded 800  IU/d ,  or extreme  sun  exposure  was reported .  Eighteen of 23 trials  that met our criteria documented an increase  in vitamin D status  with  weight loss  . Metaregression analyses indicated a marginally significant  effect of weight loss on unadjusted weighted mean difference of 25OHD  ( β = -0.60 [ 95 % confidence interval { CI } , -1.24 to + 0.04 ] nmol/L ; P = .06 ) and after adjustment for study quality ( Jadad score ≥3 ) ( β = -0.64 [ 95 % CI , -1.28 to + 0.01 ] nmol/L ; P = .05 ) . The  effect of percent fat mass on weighted mean difference of 25OHD  was also marginally significant before ( β = -0.91 [ 95 % CI , -1.96 to + 0.15 ] nmol/L ; P = .08 ) and after adjustment of study quality ( β = -1.05 [ 95 % CI , -2.18 to + 0.08 ] nmol/L ; P = .06 ) . Collectively , these outcomes  support a volumetric dilution of vitamin D.  The slopes of the respective regression lines , however , indicate a smaller  increase in 25OHD  than would be expected from a direct mobilization of stores into the circulation . Hence , sequestration of 25OHD and its conversion to inactive metabolites would also play a role . Future studies could relate changes in body fat compartments to the enzymatic regulation of 25OHD in response to weight loss."
"  GH therapy  can increase  short-term growth and improve ( near ) final height .  Increases in height are such that treated individuals remain relatively short when compared with peers of normal stature . Large , multicentre RCTs are required which should focus on  final height  and address quality of life and cost issues."
" This meta-ethnography highlights how providing skills training using structured education to  people with type 1 diabetes  does not necessarily result in participants adopting  and  sustaining  recommended changes in behaviour .  To help people sustain  diabetes self-management skills  after attending structured education , it is recommended that support be provided over the longer-term by appropriately trained healthcare professionals which is responsive to individuals ’ needs . Although developed to inform support for people with type 1 diabetes , the FUSED model provides a framework that could also be applied to support individuals with other long term conditions which require complex  self-management skills  to be learned and sustained over time .

"rSerotonin  reuptake inhibiting drugs ( SRI )  have been used in the treatment of  paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder  over the past 30 years . We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of the literature to discuss the place of and evidence for the use of  SRI  in  paediatric OCD  , based on  14 publications  of  method ologically sound , r and omized and controlled studies  . Both  SRI  and specific  SRIs  were examined and comparisons of  SRI , placebo , cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT )  ,  combined ( COMBO ) treatments ( SRI+CBT )  made to investigate their relative efficacy . Using the Cochrane methodology , and as measures of effect size mean difference and  Hedge 's g  , SRIs proved to be superior to drug  placebo  , with a modest  effect  size . From direct comparisons of CBT and SRI treatments , we conclude that CBT has the  superior efficacy .  COMBO versus CBT shows that SRI treatment adds little to  concomitant CBT  , while COMBO shows  favourable outcome  versus SRI alone . In pre-trial partial treatment responders , those who failed a SRI had better  outcome  from adding CBT as compared to continuing a SRI . Those who failed CBT treatment did as well with continued CBT as with switching to a SRI . The studies of combinations and sequences of treatments need to be developed further."
"sGraphical abstract Figure . No Caption available . Abstract The role of gut microbiota in the management of diabetes has been shown . Several current trials are investigating the effect of  probiotics and prebiotics  , which are widely used to modulate intestinal microbiota , on inflammatory factors and biomarkers of oxidative stress in  diabetic patients ;  however , their findings are controversial . The aim of the current meta‐ analysis was to evaluate the effects of  probiotic and synbiotic supplementation  on levels of  serum high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein ( hs‐CRP )  and biomarkers  of oxidative stress  in  diabetic patients  . We search ed the PubMed , Web of Science , and The Cochrane Library data bases from the inception to October 31 , 2018 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) which reported the effect of  probiotics  or  synbiotics  on circulating ( serum and plasma )  inflammatory marker ( hs‐CRP )  and  oxidative stress indicators ( malondialdehyde [ MDA ] , glutathione [ GSH ] , nitric oxide [ NO ] , and total antioxidant capacity [ TAC ] )  among  patients with diabetes were included  . Eligible studies were assessed for risk of bias and subjected to qualitative and quantitative synthesis using either fixed‐ or r and om‐effects models accounting for clinical heterogeneity . Our meta‐ analysis identified  16 eligible RCTs ( n = 1060 ) .  The method ological quality varied across these trials . Pooled data from these trials demonstrated  that probiotic and synbiotic consumption   significantly decreased hs‐CRP level  ( st and ardized mean difference [SMD]=‐0.38 ; 95 % confidence interval [CI]:‐0.51,‐0.24 ; P = 0.000  ) and  MDA ( SMD=‐0.61 ; 95 % CI : ‐0.89 , ‐0.32 ; P = 0.000 ) in diabetic patients compared to those in subjects  receiving placebos  . In addition  , probiotic and symbiotic supplementation  was found to  increase  TAC ( SMD = 0.31 ; 95 % CI : 0.09 , 0.52 ; P = 0.006 ) , NO ( SMD , 0.62 ; 95 % CI , 0.25 to 0.99 ; P =  0.001 ) and  GSH ( SMD = 0.41 ; 95 % CI : 0.26 , 0.55 , P = 0.000 ) levels . The results of this systematic review and meta‐ analysis suggest  that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation  may help to  improve biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress  in diabetic patients . Further studies are needed to develop clinical practice guidelines for the management of  inflammation and oxidative stress  in these patients."

"sPhysical  therapy  is common following  a knee surgery .  With rising healthcare costs there is debate as to the appropriateness of  outpatient physical therapy  following such interventions . Many of the existing controlled trials have concluded that there is no benefit to subjects that receive  supervised physical therapy  when compared to subjects that perform  their exercises at home .  The purpose of this systematic review was to consider the existing evidence regarding benefit following   knee surgery   and evaluate the quality , internal and external validity of such evidence .  Ten studies , all r and omized control trials  , were found to be applicable to our review . Using the PEDro scale all studies were considered at least moderate in quality . Many of the studies had design s that biased the  home exercise group  , providing supervision similar to that provided by  outpatient physical therapy .  In select  young and healthy population  with  few co morbidities   supervised physical therapy   is no more beneficial than  a   home exercise program   following relatively  simple knee surgical procedures  ( arthroscopic meniscetomy ) . However there is a lack of evidence regarding  older population s with co morbidities  or for more complicated  knee surgical  procedures ( ACL reconstruction , Total Knee Arthroplasty ) prohibiting a conclusion at this time for these population s and /or these procedures."
"eOBJECTIVE To review the performance characteristics of the instruments most commonly used to measure clinical outcomes in  juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA )  , including global assessment s , articular indices , functional/disability  assessment  s , and quality of life measures  .  METHODS As part of an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comparative effectiveness review of  antirheumatic  drugs , we explored the characteristics of commonly used outcome measures for JIA . English- language studies of  children with JIA  were identified from Medline and Embase . Two independent review ers screened titles and abstract s , with subsequent full-text review of studies selected based on predetermined criteria . RESULTS We included  35 publications describing 34 unique studies and involving 14,831 patients .  The   Childhood Health Assessment Question naire ( C-HAQ )   was the most extensively studied instrument and had high reliability , but only moderate correlations with other indices of  disease activity  and poor responsiveness to change in disease status . The  physician global assessment of disease activity ( PGA ) and articular indices  had the strongest association with  disease activity  and were the most responsive to change .  Measures of psychosocial function and quality of life  were moderately associated with measures of  disease activity  , but were less responsive to changes in disease status .  In  children with JIA  , no single instrument was superior in reliability or validity or in describing the impact of JIA . Although the  C-HAQ  has been extensively evaluated , the PGA and articular indices appear to have the highest responsiveness to change and , therefore , the highest potential for detecting important differences in treatment response."

"SSeveral r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) have investigated the use of  probiotic/synbiotic  in  PCOS patients  , without clarifying the real use in clinical practice . The aim of this meta- analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of  probiotics and synbiotics  on  metabolic , hormonal and inflammatory parameters  of  PCOS   .  Electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , Scopus , EMBASE , ScienceDirect , The Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s and Clinical Trials.gov ) were search ed from their inception until May 2019 . The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO with number CRD42018111534 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of  PCOS ’s women undergoing therapy at least 8 weeks with  probiotics or synbiotics  or without  therapy   were  included  . The primary outcomes were  changes in anthropometric parameters , glucose/insulin metabolism , lipid profile , sex hormones profile , inflammation markers  .  587 patients were included  in  nine  RCT . The administration of  probiotic/synbiotic  were associated with a significant improvement in  FPG , FBI , HOMA I-R , BMI .  It also modified  Ferriman-Gallway , serum triglycerides , serum testosterone , hs-CRP , NO , TAC , GSH , and MDA .  Subgroup analysis of the type of intervention showed that  probiotics  were associated with  greater testosterone and FPG reduction ;   synbiotics  administration result ed in a more pronounced decrease of the  FBI .  Subgroup analyses on the duration of therapy showed that ,  probiotic/synbiotic  administration had a significantly greater effect on  QUICK-I  in the case of women with 12-weeks of therapy than in the 8-weeks therapy group . Nevertheless , we did not observe any significant difference was observed in  terms  of  FBI , HOMA-IR , and FPG .   Probiotics and synbiotics  seem to either an effect on/influence  metabolic , hormonal and inflammatory parameters  , or can influence them . Consequently , it could lead to an improvement of fertility in PCOS."
"gBackground  The Timed Up and Go test ( TUG )  is a commonly used screening tool to assist clinicians to identify  patients at risk of falling .  The purpose of this systematic review and meta- analysis is to determine the overall predictive value of the  TUG  in  community-dwelling older adults .  Methods A literature search was performed to identify all studies that vali date d the  TUG test  . The method ological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool , a vali date d tool for the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies . A  TUG score  of ≥13.5 seconds was used to identify individuals at higher risk of falling . All included studies were combined using a bivariate r and om effects model to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity at ≥13.5 seconds . Heterogeneity was assessed using the variance of logit transformed sensitivity and specificity . Results  Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review and 10 studies were included  in meta- analysis .   The TUG  test  was found to be more useful at ruling in rather than ruling out  falls  in individuals classified as high risk ( > 13.5 sec ) , with a  higher pooled specificity  ( 0.74 , 95 % CI 0.52 - 0.88 ) than sensitivity ( 0.31 , 95 % CI 0.13 - 0.57 ) . Logistic regression analysis indicated that  the TUG score  is not a significant  predictor of falls  ( OR = 1.01 , 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.02 , p = 0.05 ) .  Conclusion The Timed Up and Go test  has limited ability to  predict   falls in community dwelling elderly  and should not be used in isolation to identify individuals at high risk of falls in this setting."
"sThe objective of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between  outdoor time  and : ( 1 )  physical activity , ( 2 ) cardiorespiratory fitness , ( 3 ) musculoskeletal fitness  ,  ( 4 ) sedentary behaviour ;  or (  5  )  motor skill  development  in children aged 3 - 12 years .  We identified  28 relevant  studies that were assessed for quality using the GRADE framework . The systematic review revealed overall positive effects of outdoor  time   on physical activity , sedentary behaviour , and cardiorespiratory fitness  , although causality could not be assumed due to a lack of RCTs .  Motor skill development  was unrelated to  outdoor time ;  however , this relationship was only examined in a single study of  preschool children .  No studies were found that examined associations between outdoor time and musculoskeletal fitness."
"  Physical activity and healthy diets  in early childhood are associated with better  cognitive outcomes   in young children .  The paucity of literature and the variability in the type and quality of measures used highlight the need for more rigorous research . Given that the early childhood years are critical for both obesity prevention and neurocognitive development , evidence that the same healthy behaviors could promote both should inform future interventions."

" Future physical health monitoring recommendations for patients with  schizophrenia  should include the  6MWT .  Future studies should investigate its predictive role and continue to assess its measurement properties . IMPLICATION S FOR REHABILITATION The Six-Minute Walk Test reliably assesses the  functional exercise capacity  in  patients with schizophrenia .  The impact of therapeutic interventions on patients , as measured by the 6MWT , can not be confirmed . Clinicians should take into account overweight , antipsychotic medication use and the physical self-perception when considering the functional exercise capacity in schizophrenia . Clinicians should follow International st and ards such as these of the American Thoracic Society when using the Six-Minute Walk Test in patients with severe mental illnesses."
"sCurrently the effects of  bariatric surgery  are generally expressed in excess weight loss or comorbidity reduction . Therefore the aim of this review was to provide insight in the available prospect i ve evidence regarding the short and long-term effects of  bariatric surgery  on  Quality of Life ( QoL )  and a comparison with community norms . A systematic multi- data base search was conducted for ‘ QoL ’ and  ‘ Bariatric surgery ’  . Only prospect i ve studies with QoL before  and after  bariatric surgery   were included . The ‘  Quality Assessment Tool  for Before – After Studies with No Control Group ’ was used to assess the method ological quality .  Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria .  Most studies were assessed to be of ‘ fair ’ to ‘ good ’ method ological quality . Ten different question naires were used to measure  QoL.  Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 10 years , sample sizes from 26 to  1276  and follow-up rates from 45 to 100 % . A significant  increase in QoL   after bariatric surgery  was found in all studies ( P⩽0.05 ) , however , mostly these outcomes  stay below  community norms .  Only outcomes of the IWQoL , SF-36 and OWQoL show QoL outcomes that exceed  community  norms  .  The QoL is increased  after  bariatric surgery  on both the short and long term . However , due to the heterogeneity of the studies and the generality of the question naires is it hard to make a distinction between different surgeries and difficult to see a relation with medical profit . Therefore , tailoring  QoL  measurements to the  bariatric population  is recommended as the focus of future studies."
"eBackground :   Placebo  response  is high in  bipolar disorder trials .  This is a challenge for research ers and an enigma for clinicians . This article will attempt to aid in the comprehension of the ethical questions and method ologies related to the use of  placebo  in  bipolar disorder .  Methods : A systematic review of the main computerized data bases ( Medline , Embase , Psychlit , Current Contents ) was carried out , using the following key words :  placebo  , bipolar disorder , mania , depression , clinical trial . Results :  Placebo  has a very important role in the study of  bipolar disorders .  From a method ological point of view , and given the limitations of non-inferiority design s , the use of  placebo  is necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of the study and ensure that the drug under investigation is really effective . For this reason , several procedures may be used to satisfactorily solve the ethical objections .   Placebo  response  in bipolar disorder trials is more likely to occur in  patients who are mildly ill , bipolar II , mixed-episode , first-episode , rapid cycling , atypical , non-psychotic , substance abusers and medically ill .  The use of concomitant medication such as benzodiazepines , a high frequency of visits , a high number of treatment groups and sites , fixed-dose design s , and the concomitant use of psychotherapy are likely to increase  placebo response .  Conclusion : The subject of the use of  placebo  in psychiatric clinical trials leads to very relevant ethical , method ological and clinical dilemmas . Many reasons support the use of  placebo  in acute bipolar studies , whereas in maintenance the length of the treatment with  placebo  makes the decision more difficult . Ethical concerns can be addressed through operational definitions of outcome measures , add-on and discontinuation design s , early escape strategies , and processes design ed to make sure that fully informed consent was fairly obtained . There are a number of clinical and method ological variables that are associated with  placebo  response."

"sBladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis ( BPS/IC ) is a chronic disease characterised by persistent irritating micturition symptoms and pain . The objective was to compare the clinical efficacy of currently available products for  intravesical therapy  of BPS/IC and to assess their pharmacoeconomic impact . A Pubmed / Medline data base search was performed for articles on   intravesical therapy for BPS/IC  .  A total of  345 publications were identified , from which 326 were excluded .  Statistical evaluation was performed with  effect size ( ES ) assessment of symptom reduction and response rates .  The final set of  19 articles  on   intravesical BPS/IC therapy   included  5 prospect i ve controlled trials ( CTs  ) , the remaining were classified as uncontrolled clinical studies .  The total number of patients included was 801 , 228 of whom had been evaluated in a CT .  For CTs , the largest ES  for symptom reduction as well as response rate  was observed for high molecular weight  hyaluronic acid ( HMW-HA )  , with similar findings in two uncontrolled studies with  HMW-HA .  The  number needed to treat  to  achieve a  response to intravesical therapy was 2.67 for intravesical pentosan polysulphate and 1.31 for  HMW-HA  which were superior to all other instillates .  HMW-HA  was significantly superior in  cost effectiveness and cost efficacy  to all other instillation regimes . The present meta- analysis combined medical and pharmacoeconomic aspects and demonstrated an advantage of  HMW-HA  over other instillation agents ; however , direct comparisons between the different products have not been performed to date in properly design ed controlled studies."
"sIncreased  plasma lipid profiles  are among the most important risk factors of CHD and stroke .  Sesame  contains considerable amounts of vitamin E , MUFA , fibre and lignans , which are thought to be associated with its plasma lipid-lowering properties . This study aim ed to systematic ally review the evidence and identify the effects of  sesame consumption  on  blood lipid profiles  using a meta- analysis of controlled trials . PubMed , CINAHL and Cochrane Library data bases were search ed  ( from 1960 to May 2015 )  . A total of  ten controlled trials were identified  based on the  eligibility  criteria . Both the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the Rosendal scale were used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies . The meta- analysis results showed that consumption  of sesame  did not significantly change  the concentrations of total blood cholesterol  ( -0·32 mmol/l ; 95 % CI -0·75 , 0·11 ; P=0·14 , I(2)=96 %  ) , LDL-cholesterol  ( -0·15 mmol/l ; 95 % CI -0·50 , 0·19 ; P=0·39 , I(2)=96 %  ) or HDL-cholesterol  ( 0·01 mmol/l ; 95 % CI -0·00 , 0·02 ; P=0·16 , I(2)=0 % ) . However , a significant reduction  was observed in serum TAG levels  ( -0·24 mmol/l ; 95 % CI -0·32 , -0·15 ; P<0·001 , I(2)=84 % ) after consumption  of sesame  . It was concluded  that sesame  consumption can significantly  reduce blood TAG levels  but there is insufficient evidence to support its  hypocholesterolaemic  effects . Further studies are required to determine the potential effect  of sesame  consumption on lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk factors."
"nTo overcome limitations of  minimally invasive surgical ablation  as a st and alone procedure in eliminating   atrial fibrillation ( AF )   , hybrid approaches incorporating adjunctive endovascular catheter ablation have been proposed in recent years . The endovascular component targets residual conduction gaps and identifies additional electrophysiological targets with the goal of minimizing  recurrent atrial arrhythmia .  We performed a systematic review of published studies of  hybrid AF ablation  , analyzing  432 pooled patients ( 19 % paroxysmal , 29 % persistent , 52 % long-st and ing persistent ) treated using three different approaches : A.  bilateral thoracoscopy with bipolar radiofrequency ( RF ) clamp-based approach ;  B.  right thoracoscopic suction monopolar RF catheter-based approach ;  and C.  subxiphoid posterior pericardioscopic ( "" convergent "" ) approach .    Freedom from recurrence off antiarrhythmic medications  at 12 months was seen in 88.1 % [ 133/151 ] for A , 73.4 % [ 47/64 ] for B , and 59.3 % [ 80/135 ] for C , with no significant difference between paroxysmal ( 76.9 % ) and persistent/long-st and ing persistent AF ( 73.4 % ) .  Death and major surgical complications  were reported in 8.5 % with A , 0 % with B and 8.6 % with C. A critical appraisal of  hybrid ablation  is presented , drawing from experiences and insights published over the years on catheter ablation of AF , with a discussion of the rationale underlying hybrid ablation , its strengths and limitations , where it may have a unique role in clinical management of  patients with AF  , which questions remain unanswered and areas for further investigation."

"dAt least 20 % of people over the  age of  65 suffer from mental disorders . It is anticipated that the number of  older Americans with psychiatric disorders  will double over the next 30 years . There is , however , substantial unmet need . The recent Surgeon General 's Report on Mental Health , a Report on Mental Health from the Administration on Aging , and an expert consensus statement underscore the need to plan for the challenge of providing services for  elderly people with major mental disorders .  Among the greatest challenges is the expertise gap that affects clinicians practicing in routine clinical setting s. This gap reflects inadequate training in geriatrics and a failure to incorporate contemporary clinical research findings and known evidence -based practice s ( EBPs ) into usual care . This article provides an overview of the emerging evidence -base supporting the efficacy of  empirically-vali date d geriatric  mental health  interventions  for major geriatric mental health disorders , including systematic EBP review s , meta-analytic studies , and expert consensus statements . Caution s and limitations regarding the reliance on r and omized , controlled trials , meta-analyses , and systematic review s also are presented."

".INTRODUCTION  Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies ( TRUS-gb )  are associated with both mild and serious complications .  Prophylactic antibiotics  reduce the risk of  septicaemia  and  mortality ;  however , no international consensus exists on the timing and duration of antibiotics , including the optimal drug strategy . We review ed the current evidence supporting use of  prophylactic antibiotics  and the risk of complications following  prostate biopsies .  METHODS This review was drafted in accordance with the Prisma Guidelines . The PubMed , Embase and Cochrane data bases were search ed . RESULTS  A total of 19 eligible trials were identified .  One trial demonstrated a significant reduction in the  risk of infection  after biopsy and reported that  oral ciprofloxacin  as either a single-dose or a three-day regimen was superior to  oral chloramphenicol and norfloxacin .  Of three studies investigating the timing of the first dose of antibiotic , one study found that administration 24 h before biopsy versus administration immediately before reduced the  relative risk of post-biopsy infection  by 55 % . Seven studies compared different  duration s of antibiotic prophylaxis  . None showed any benefit from continuing prophylaxis beyond a single dose or a one-day regimen .  Evidence supporting a specific antibiotic regimen for TRUS-gb prophylaxis is scarce . Widespread use of  fluoroquinolone  prophylaxis may be associated with an increase in resistant Escherichia coli strains , posing a potentially major health issue in the future .."
"PBACKGROUND Despite clear benefits of the  Evidence -Based Practice ( EBP )  approach to ensuring quality and consistency of care , its uptake within physiotherapy has been inconsistent . OBJECTIVES Synthesis e the findings of research into  EBP  barriers , facilitators and interventions in physiotherapy and identify methods of enhancing adoption and implementation . DATA SOURCES  Literature concerning physiotherapists ' practice between 2000 and 2012  was systematic ally search ed using : Academic Search Complete , Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus , American Psychological Association data bases , Medline , Journal Storage , and Science Direct . Reference lists were search ed to identify additional studies . STUDY SELECTION  Thirty-two studies , focusing either on physiotherapists '  EBP  knowledge , attitudes or implementation , or  EBP interventions  in physiotherapy were included .  DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One author undertook all data extraction and a second author review ed to ensure consistency and rigour . Synthesis was organised around the themes of  EBP barriers/enablers , attitudes , knowledge/skills , use  and  interventions  . RESULTS Many physiotherapists hold positive  attitudes towards EBP  . However , this does not necessarily translate into consistent  , high- quality EBP .  Many barriers to EBP implementation are apparent , including :  lack of time and skills , and misperceptions of EBP .  LIMITATIONS Only studies published in the English language , in peer- review ed journals were included , thereby introducing possible publication bias . Furthermore , narrative synthesis may be subject to greater confirmation bias .  AND IMPLICATION S There is no "" one-size fits all "" approach to enhancing   EBP  implementation ;  assessing organisational culture prior to design ing interventions is crucial . Although some interventions appear promising , further research is required to explore the most effective methods of supporting physiotherapists  '  adoption of EBP."

"sOBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to review the  radiological alignment outcomes  of  patient Specific ( PS ) cutting blocks and St and ard Instrumentation  in  Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty .  METHODS We hypothesized that the use of  PS techniques  would significantly improve  sagittal , coronal and rotational alignment of the prosthesis  on short term . We performed a systematic review and a meta- analysis including all the r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) using  PS and st and ard ( ST ) total knee arthroplasty  to date . RESULTS  A total of 538 PS TKA and 549 ST TKA were included in the study .  Statistical analysis of the outliers for  femoral component sagittal , coronal and rotational positioning , tibial component sagittal and coronal positioning and the overall mechanical axis  were assessed . We found that there was no significant benefit from using  PS  instrumentation in primary knee arthroplasty to aid in the positioning of either the tibial or femoral components . Furthermore  sagittal plane tibial component positioning  was worse in the  PS  than the traditional  ST  group .  Our results suggest that at present  PS  instrumentation is not superior to ST instrumentation in primary total knee arthroplasty .

">We sought to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the predictors of   surgical site infection ( SSI )  after cardiac surgery .  We included published , peer- review ed , English- language , retrospective and prospect i ve studies identified in a search of Medline , CINAHL , and PubMed from 2005 and through February 20 , 2012 . The studies involved  adults ( age > 18 years ) undergoing cardiac surgery ( defined by ICD-9 codes ) and could be of any study design , in English , published within last 7 years , with data collection taking place in United States within last 10 years .  We excluded animal  studies  , duplicates , summaries , commentaries , editorials , case reports ,  studies  that  conducted outside United States ,  and  studies published before last 7 years or studies with data collection take place before last 10 years ( 2002  ) . Three types of predictors emerge :  Predictors of general infection  post  cardiac surgery  ,  predictors of micro-organisms ' specific SSIs and tracheotomy ,  and  allogenic blood transfusion  as specific  predictors  of SSI . Although the review ed articles cover wide range of  SSIs  predictors , none of these articles investigate preoperative skin preparation , using  pre- and postoperative prophylaxes antibiotics  ,   postoperative wound care  ( appropriate time for first dressing )  , and  patient nutritional status  as a predictors of SSIs after cardiac surgery . Investigating these predictors for SSIs will enhance nurses ' underst and ing of the importance of specific types of nutrition in preventing SSIs and enhancing wound healing , implementing a protocol for the wound care postoperatively , and implementing a protocol for the use of  prophylactic antibiotics ."
" HbA1c  is neither sensitive nor specific for detecting pre‐diabetes ; fasting glucose  is specific  but not sensitive  . Interventions in people classified through screening as having pre‐diabetes  have some efficacy  in preventing or delaying  onset of type 2  diabetes in trial population s. As screening is inaccurate , many people will receives an incorrect diagnosis and be referred on for interventions while others will be falsely reassured and not offered the intervention . These findings suggest that “ screen and treat ” policies alone are unlikely to have substantial impact on the worsening epidemic of type 2 diabetes . Registration PROSPERO ( No CRD42016042920 )."

 The differential relationship of the  hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention domains  with mathematics emphasises the heterogeneity within the disorder and suggests a partially different aetiology of the two ADHD domains . A better underst and ing of the aetiology of ADHD could help develop more efficient interventions aim ed at the reduction of its symptoms . It could also offer an explanatory framework for shortcomings in achievement and inform the development of non-pharmacological intervention strategies.
" There is some evidence that EIBI is an effective behavioral treatment for some  children with ASD .  However , the current state of the evidence is limited because of the reliance on data from non-r and omized studies ( CCTs ) due to the lack of RCTs .

"IABSTRACT Background :  Cocoa and dark chocolate ( DC )  have been reported to be effective for health promotion ; however the exact effect of  cocoa/DC  on anthropometric  measures  have not been yet defined . Methods : A comprehensive search to identify r and omized clinical trials investigating the impact  of  cocoa/DC  on  body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumference ( WC )   was performed up to  December 2017 .  A meta- analysis of eligible studies was performed using r and om effects model to estimate pooled effect size . Fractional polynominal modeling was used to explore dose-response relationships . Results :  A total of 35 RCTs investigated the effects of  cocoa/DC  on  weight , BMI and  WC were included .  Meta- analysis did not suggest any significant effect  of cocoa/DC supplementation   on body weight  ( −0.108 kg , 95 % CI −0.262 , 0.046 P = 0.168  ) , BMI  ( −0.014 kg/m2 95 % CI −0.105 , 0.077 , P : 0.759 ,  ) and  WC ( 0.025 cm 95 % CI −0.083 , 0.129 , P = 0.640 ) . Subgroup analysis revealed that  that weight and BMI  were  reduced with cocoa/DC supplementation  ≥ 30 g  chocolate  per day in trials between 4 - 8 weeks .  Cocoa/DC  consumption  result ed in WC reduction  in non-linear fashion ( r = 0.042 , P-nonlinearity = 0.008 ) .  Conclusion : Cocoa/DC supplementation  does not  reduce anthropometric measures  significantly . However subgroup analysis regarding dose ( ≥ 30 g/day ) and duration ( between 4 to 8 weeks ) revealed significant reduction of body weight and BMI."
"sOne often alleges that laboratory bond-strength testing can not predict clinical effectiveness of adhesives . Major argument to sustain this cl aim is the wide variation in bond-strength values recorded for one specific adhesive among different research institutes worldwide . The main reason for these inconsistent bond-strength measurements is supposedly the current lack of a st and ard bond-strength testing protocol . This paper ( and presentation ) aim ed to report on an extensive literature review with regard to the different  laboratory bond-strength test methods  and their data provided , along with a second extensive literature review on  clinical effectiveness  data of adhesives in terms of retention rates of  adhesive Class-V restorations  . Combining both systematic review s , we have subsequently search ed for a potential relationship between bond-strength  data  and clinical outcomes."
"lBackground The high precision of  radiostereometric analysis ( RSA )  has enabled us to predict  long-term implant survival  with a small sample of  patients followed  for a relatively short period of time . The purpose of our systematic review was to vali date the predictive value of two-year  RSA  results on  long-term survival  of  different types of primary total hip arthroplasty stems .  Methods We systematic ally review ed literature to determine the maximum  total point motion ( MTPM )  , distal migration and rotation of stem design s and correlated these values to survival rates for aseptic loosening of these specific stems in  arthroplasty registries .  Results We included  32 studies describing migration of 15 different stem design s.  The mean  MTPM  for straight  polished  cemented  stems  was 1.35 mm , for other cemented stems 0.83 mm and for other uncemented stems 1.50 mm . No data were available for the uncemented collared stem .  Mean distal migration  for straight  polished cemented stems  was 1.24 mm , for other cemented stems 0.26 mm , the uncemented collared stem 0.40 mm and for other uncemented stems 0.66 mm .  Internal rotation  was presented for 13 stems and all stems rotated into retroversion . All stems showed  10-year survival rates  of > 97 % corrected for aseptic loosening . Discussion Reporting  RSA  results in a universal way including interpretation of outliers could improve the predictive value of  RSA  , allowing this technique to be an important tool during the phased introduction of new implant design s. However , a quality assessment of the data by an experienced review er is essential."
"sPurpose The actual effects of  l-carnitine administration  on  leptin serum level  is inconsistent . In order to assess the efficacy of  l-carnitine supplementation  on  serum leptin  we conducted a meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Methods  Seven studies with 325 cases and 330 controls were included .  The pooled weighted mean difference ( WMD ) was calculated by r and om-effects model . The heterogeneity across studies was evaluated by using Cochrane ’s Q and I2 tests . In addition , we carried out the metaninf comm and to test the effect of each individual study on the overall result .  Results l-carnitine supplementation  seemed to have no significant effect  on serum leptin concentrations  ( WMD : −0.565 ng/mL ; 95 % CI : −2.417 to 1.287 , p = 0.550 ) . However ,  between- study heterogeneity  was higher across all studies ( I2 = 84.3 % , p < 0.0001 ) . Subgroup analysis to find the sources of heterogeneity showed that  l-carnitine  dosage ( g ) ( < 2 g : I2 = 00.0 % , p = 0.408 ) , and study population ( diabetes : I2 = 46.7 % , p = 0.153 , and non-diabetes : I2 = 15.1 % , p = 0.317 ) were the potential sources of heterogeneity . Besides , a more significant  reduction in serum leptin concentration  was observed with a daily dose of ≥  2 mg l-carnitine  ( WMD : −2.742 ng/mL ; 95 % CI : −3.039 to −2.444 , p < 0.001 ) , in  diabetic patients  ( WMD : −2.946 ng/mL ; 95 % CI : −3.254 to −2.638 , p < 0.001 ) , and with intervention duration < 12 weeks ( WMD : −2.772 ng/mL ; 95 % CI : −3.073 to −2.471 , p < 0.001 ) .  Conclusion l-carnitine  consumption does not  reduce serum leptin  significantly . However , a significant effect  on  leptin was observed in  diabetic patients and patients  who received doses more than 3 mg per day in the course of < 12 weeks."
"iPURPOSE To provide evidence -based recommendations to oncologists and others for treatment of  patients with locally advanced , unresectable pancreatic cancer .  METHODS American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Expert Panel of medical oncology , radiation oncology , surgical oncology , gastroenterology , palliative care , and advocacy experts and conducted a systematic review of the literature from January 2002 to June 2015 . Outcomes included  overall survival , disease-free survival , progression-free survival , and adverse events .  RESULTS  Twenty-six r and omized controlled trials  met the systematic review criteria . RECOMMENDATIONS A  multiphase computed tomography scan  of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis should be performed . Baseline performance status and comorbidity profile should be evaluated . The goals of  care  , patient preferences , psychological status , support systems , and symptoms should guide decisions for treatments . A palliative care referral should occur at first visit .  Initial systemic chemotherapy  ( 6 months  ) with a combination regimen  is recommended for most patients ( for some patients radiation therapy may be offered up front ) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and a favorable comorbidity profile . There is no clear evidence to support one regimen over another . The  gemcitabine-based combinations and treatments  recommended in the metastatic setting ( eg ,  fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan , and oxaliplatin and gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel )  have not been evaluated in r and omized controlled trials involving locally advanced , unresectable pancreatic cancer . If there is local disease progression after  induction chemotherapy  , without metastasis ,  then radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiotherapy  may be offered also with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2 and an adequate comorbidity profile . If there is stable disease after 6 months of induction  chemotherapy but unacceptable toxicities  , radiation therapy may be offered as an alternative .  Patients with disease progression  should be offered treatment per the ASCO Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Guideline . Follow-up visits every 3 to 4 months are recommended .

"sMobility is critical in maintaining independence in  older adults .  This study aims to systematic ally review the scientific literature to identify measures of mobility limitation for  community-dwelling older adults .  A systematic search of PubMed , CINAHL , and psycINFO , using the search terms ""  mobility  limitation "" , "" mobility  disability  "" , and ""   mobility  difficulty  "" yielded  1,847 articles from 1990 to 2012 ; a final selection of 103 articles was  used for the present manuscript . Tools to measure mobility were found to be either self-report or performance-based instruments . Commonly measured constructs of mobility included  walking , climbing stairs , and lower extremity function .  There was heterogeneity in ways of defining and measuring  mobility limitation  in  older adults living in the community .  Given the lack of consistency in assessment tools for mobility , a clear underst and ing and st and ardization of instruments are required for comparison across studies and for better underst and ing indicators and outcomes of mobility limitation in  community-dwelling  older adults."
"yThis systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to evaluate the efficacy of daily  oral bovine lactoferrin  versus daily  oral ferrous iron preparations  for treatment of  iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) during pregnancy .  Search es were conducted on PubMed , ScienceDirect , Clinical Trials.gov and CENTRAL data bases from inception to February 2017 and the bibliographies of retrieved articles were screened . The PRISMA Statement was followed . Published English language r and omized trials comparing  lactoferrin with oral ferrous iron preparations  in  pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia  were included . Quasi-r and omized , non- r and omized or studies including other known cause of anemia , gestational or pre-existent maternal diseases were excluded . Accordingly  , 4 eligible trials ( 600 women ) were analyzed .  Primary outcome was  change in hemoglobin level  at 4 weeks of treatment . Secondary outcomes were ;  change in serum ferritin and iron , rates of gastrointestinal side effects , preterm birth , low birthweight , neonatal death and mean birthweight .  Quality assessment was performed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool . Odds ratio and mean difference were used to integrate dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively . Pooled estimates for change  in hemoglobin levels  at four weeks favored daily  oral lactoferrin  over daily  oral ferrous sulphate  ( mean difference 0.77 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.04 - 1.55 ; P=0.04 , 4 trials , 600 women ) . However , after subgroup analysis ( degree of anemia ) , no significant difference in  hemoglobin levels  were found between both groups in mild anemia ( mean difference 0.80 ; 95 % CI -0.21 to 1.82 , 3 trials , 372 women ) , but a significant increase  favoring lactoferrin  was reported in moderate anemia ( mean difference 0.68 ; 95 % CI 0.53 - 0.83 ; P<0.00001 , one trial , 228 women ) . Significantly less  gastrointestinal side effects  were reported with  lactoferrin  treatment . No significant differences existed with regard to other outcomes . In conclusion , for  pregnant women with IDA  , daily  oral bovine lactoferrin  is just as good as  ferrous sulfate  in improving  hematological parameters  with fewer  gastrointestinal side effects .  Thereby ,  lactoferrin  should be the iron replacement agent of choice for treatment of IDA in pregnancy."

"sStudy Design : Retrospective literature review of  spine surgical  site infection ( SSI )   . Objective : To perform a review of  SSI  risk factors and more specifically , categorize them into patient and surgical factors . Methods : A review of published literature on   SSI   risk factors in  adult spine surgery  was performed . We included studies that reported risk factors for  SSI in adult spinal surgery .  Excluded are  pediatric patient population s , systematic review s , and meta-analyses .  Overall , we identified  72 cohort studies , 1 controlled-cohort study , 1 matched-cohort  study  , 1 matched-paired  cohort study  , 12  case-controlled studies  ( CCS ) , 6 case series , and 1 cross-sectional study .  Results : Patient-associated risk factors — diabetes mellitus , obesity ( body mass index > 35 kg/m2 ) , subcutaneous fat thickness , multiple medical comorbidities , current smoker , and malnutrition were associated with SSI . Surgical associated factors — preoperative  radiation/postoperative blood transfusion  ,  combined anterior/posterior approach , surgical invasiveness  , or  levels of instrumentation  were associated with increased  SSI .  There is mixed evidence of  age , duration of surgery , surgical team , intraoperative blood loss , dural tear , and urinary tract infection/urinary catheter  in association with SSI . Conclusion :  SSIs  are associated with many risk factors that can be patient or surgically related . Our review was able to identify important modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors that can be essential in surgical planning and discussion with patients."

"dUNLABELLED The purpose of this systematic review was to quantitatively find out whether  resin-modified  glass-ionomers  ( RM-GIC )  , in comparison to  fluoride-containing composite resin and composite resin without fluoride  , are associated with a more effective reduction of  demineralization  in hard tooth tissues under caries challenge . Five data bases were systematic ally search ed on clinical trials up to 6 April 2009 . Article inclusion criteria :  titles/ abstract s relevant in  answering the  review question , published in English , two-arm ( prospect i ve ) longitudinal trial ; EXCLUSION CRITERIA not all included subjects accounted for at the end of the trial ; subjects of both groups not followed up the same way ;  no r and omized , quasi-r and omized controlled study design for in situ and clinical trials  ;  contains no computable continuous data . Quality assessment of the accepted in situ and clinical trials was performed . Data were extracted in the form of data sets , containing numbers of evaluated sample s and mean result with st and ard deviation for both groups .  Fifteen articles were selected for review .  Two lacked computable data and were excluded ; nine laboratory trials , three r and omized in situ trials and one r and omized control trial were accepted . From these , 97 continuous data sets were extracted . The evidence suggests that  RM-GIC  is associated with a  higher reduction of demineralization  in adjacent hard tooth tissue than composite resin without fluoride . No difference was found when  RM-GIC  was compared with  fluoride-containing composite resin . RM-GIC  showed  efficacy  in  reducing demineralization .  However , the internal validity of the current evidence is limited and further high- quality trials are needed."
"dOver the past decade , a large body of observational evidence has suggested an association between   lower vitamin D status ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D )  and multiple acute and chronic disorders , including cancer , multiple sclerosis , depression and respiratory tract infections .  This evidence has fostered the hypothesis that increasing  vitamin D  intake may treat and prevent such disorders . Our objective was to perform a critical analysis of the highest-level evidence for ten common beliefs regarding  vitamin D  for the prevention of  falls , fractures and respiratory tract infections  , the reduction of  cancer  incidence/mortality and overall mortality , and the prevention or treatment of depression/mental well-being , rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis , as well as maximum dosing and regular testing . We search ed the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s and PubMed  ( up to August 2014 )  for r and omized controlled trials and systematic review s/meta-analyses based on those studies . All search es were performed , all evidence review ed and each section written by at least two authors . The evidence shows  that vitamin D supplementation  provides some benefit  in fracture prevention  ( likely ∼10–15 % relative reduction ) , particularly at a dose ≥800 IU and with calcium ; a likely benefit in  the rate of falls  , though it is less clear whether the number of fallers changes ; and a possible small ( ∼5 % ) relative  reduction in mortality .  Evidence does not support the  use of vitamin  D  supplementation  for  the prevention of cancer , respiratory infections or rheumatoid arthritis .  Similarly , evidence does not  support vitamin D supplementation  for the  treatment of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis or for improving depression/mental well-being .  Regular testing  of 25-hydroxyvitamin D  is generally not required , and mega-doses ( ≥300,000 IU ) appear to increase harms . Much of the evidence is at high risk of bias , with multiple flaws , including analyses of secondary endpoints , small and underpowered studies , inconsistent results and numerous other issues . Therefore , enthusiasm for a  vitamin D  panacea should be tempered."
"sChronic  cancer  pain is a serious complication of malignancy or its treatment . Currently , no comprehensive , universally accepted cancer pain classification system exists . Clarity in classification of common cancer pain syndromes would improve clinical assessment and management . Moreover , an evidence -based taxonomy would enhance cancer pain research efforts by providing consistent diagnostic criteria , ensuring comparability across clinical trials . As part of a collaborative effort between the Analgesic , Anesthetic , and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations , Innovations , Opportunities , and Networks ( ACTTION ) and the American Pain Society ( APS ) , the ACTTION-APS Pain Taxonomy initiative worked to develop the characteristics of an optimal diagnostic system . After the establishment of these characteristics , a working group consisting of clinicians and clinical and basic scientists with expertise in  cancer and cancer-related pain  was convened to generate core diagnostic criteria for an illustrative sample of  3 chronic pain syndromes associated with cancer ( ie  ,  bone pain and  pancreatic  cancer pain as models of pain related to a tumor ) or its treatment ( ie  ,  chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ) .  A systematic review and synthesis was conducted to provide evidence for the dimensions that comprise this  cancer pain taxonomy  . Future efforts will subject these diagnostic categories and criteria to systematic empirical evaluation of their feasibility , reliability , and validity and extension to other cancer-related pain syndromes."
" We found moderate- quality evidence to suggest that the  use of arm support with alternative mouse  may reduce the  incidence of neck/shoulder MSDs  , but not right  upper limb  MSDs . Moreover , we found moderate- quality evidence to suggest that the  incidence of neck/shoulder and right upper limb MSDs  is not reduced when comparing  alternative and conventional mouse with and without arm support .  However , given there were multiple comparisons made involving a number of interventions and outcomes , high- quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions clearly . While we found very-low- to low- quality evidence to suggest that other ergonomic interventions do not prevent  work-related MSDs  of the upper limb and neck , this was limited by the paucity and heterogeneity of available studies . This review highlights the need for high- quality RCTs examining the prevention of MSDs of the upper limb and neck."

"yThis article presents a systematic review of the scientific evidence linking  sugar consumption  and health  in the adult population  performed by a group of experts ,  m and ated  by the  French Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation , de l'environnement , et du travail ( ANSES ) .  A literature search was performed by crossing search terms for overweight/obesity , diabetes/insulin resistance , dyslipidemia/cardiovascular diseases , non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases ( NAFLD ) , and uric acid concentrations on one h and and for intake of  sugars  on the other . Controlled mechanistic studies , prospect i ve cohort studies , and r and omized clinical trials were extracted and assessed . A literature analysis supported links between   sugar   intake and  both total energy intake and body weight gain  , and between  sugar intake and blood triglycerides  independently of total energy intake . The effects of  sugar on blood triglycerides  were shown to be mediated by the fructose component of sucrose and were observed with an intake of fructose > 50 g/day . In addition , prospect i ve cohort studies showed associations  between sugar intake and the risk of diabetes/insulin resistance , cardiovascular diseases , NAFLD , and hyperuricemia .  Based on these observations , ANSES proposed to set a maximum limit to the intake  of total sugars containing fructose ( sucrose , glucose⁻fructose syrups , honey or other syrups , and natural concentrates , etc  .  )  of 100 g/day."
"sAnkylosing  spondylitis ( AS )  is a chronic and inflammatory rheumatic disease , characterized by pain and structural and functional impairments , such as reduced mobility and axial deformity , which lead to diminished quality of life . Its treatment includes not only drugs , but also  nonpharmacological therapy . Exercise  appears to be a promising modality . The aim of this study is to review the current evidence and evaluate the role of  exercise either on l and or in water  for the management of  patients with AS in the biological era .  Systematic review of the literature published until November 2016 in Medline , Embase , Cochrane Library , Web of Science and Scopus data bases .  Thirty-five studies were included for further analysis  ( 30 concerning  l and exercise  and 5 concerning  water exercise ; combined or not with biological drugs )   , comprising a total of 2515 patients .  Most studies showed a  positive effect of  exercise  on Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index , Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index , pain , mobility , function and quality of life .  The benefit was statistically significant in r and omized controlled trials . Results support a multimodal approach ,  including educational sessions and maintaining home-based program .  This study highlights the important role  of  exercise   in  management of AS  , therefore it should be encouraged and individually prescribed . More studies with good method ological quality are needed to strengthen the results and to define the specific characteristics of  exercise programs  that determine better results."

"eIntroduction :  Non-invasive telemonitoring programmes  detecting  deterioration of heart failure  are increasingly used in heart failure care . Aim : The aim of this study was to compare different  monitoring algorithms  used in  non-invasive telemonitoring programmes  for  patients with chronic heart failure .  Methods : We performed a systematic literature review in MEDLINE ( PubMed ) and Embase to identify published reports on  non-invasive telemonitoring programmes  in  patients with heart failure aged over 18 years .  Results : Out of  99 studies included in the study  , 20 ( 20 % ) studies described the algorithm used for monitoring  worsening heart failure  or  algorithms  used for  titration of heart  failure  medication .  Most frequently used  biometric measurements  were  bodyweight  ( 96 % ) ,  blood pressure  ( 85 % ) and  heart rate  ( 61 % ) . Algorithms to detect  worsening heart failure  were based on  daily changes in bodyweight  in 20 ( 100 % ) studies and /or  blood pressure  in 12 ( 60 % ) studies . In 12 ( 60 % ) studies patients were  contacted by telephone  in the case of measurements outside thresholds . Conclusion : Only one in five studies on telemonitoring in chronic heart failure reported the algorithm that was used to detect  worsening heart failure .  St and ardised description of the  telemonitoring algorithm  can expedite the identification of key components in  telemonitoring  algorithms that allow accurate prediction of worsening heart failure."
"eA systematic review of published and unpublished data on the use of  long-acting medications  in  ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder  is reported , giving effect  sizes  and  numbers-to-treat  for  extended-release stimulant preparations and atomoxetine ( ATX ) .  A panel of experts from several European countries used the review to make recommendations about the use of these drugs in practice , and conclusions are reported : ( 1 )  Long-acting  preparations should be available and used ; ( 2 ) They should not replace short-acting drugs ( which will be the initial treatment for many children for reasons of cost and flexibility of dosing ) . Individual clinical choice is needed . ( 3 ) Both  ATX  and  extended-release preparations  of  stimulants  should be available .

">The suboptimal outcomes of  atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation  have been attributed to lack of transmural lesions during pulmonary vein isolation . The advent of  contact force ( CF ) sensing technology  enables real-time assessment of the applied force at the catheter-tissue interface and increases the chances of transmural lesions . We sought to perform a meta- analysis of data from eligible studies to delineate the true impact of  CF technology  . Data base search es  through April 2015 identified 9 eligible studies ( enrolling 1148 patients ) .  The  relative risk of AF recurrence  at follow-up was used as the primary end point and assessed with r and om-effects meta- analysis .  Radiofrequency ( RF ) duration , total procedure length , and fluoroscopy exposure  were assessed as secondary outcomes using weighted mean difference with the r and om-effects model . Compared with  st and ard technology  , the use  of CF technology  showed a 37 % reduction ( relative risk 0.63 ; 95 % confidence interval 0.44 - 0.91 ; P = .01 ) in  AF recurrence  at a median follow-up of 12 months and a 7.3-minute reduction ( 95 % confidence interval -14.05 to -0.55 ; P = .03 ) in RF use during ablation . There was no significant difference in  total procedure length and fluoroscopy exposure  between the 2 groups . In conclusion , this meta- analysis shows that the use  of CF technology  decreases  AF recurrence  at a median follow-up of 12 months and also led to decreased use of RF during ablation . There was no difference in  total procedure length and fluoroscopy exposure ."
 Effects of antihypertensive drugs  on SBP variability  are dose-dependent and persist when used in combinations . Use of a high dose of  a calcium channel blocker  alone or in combination with other agents is therefore likely to be particularly effective in prevention of stroke.
"tBackground  Cardiovascular risk management  ( CVRM ) is notoriously difficult because of multi-morbidity and the different phenotypes and severities of cardiovascular disease .  Computerized decision support systems ( CDSS )  enable the clinician to integrate the latest scientific evidence and patient information into tailored strategies . The effect on cardiovascular risk factor management is yet to be confirmed . Methods We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis evaluating the effects of  CDSS  on CVRM , defined as the change in absolute values and attainment of treatment goals of  systolic blood pressure  (  SBP )  ,  low density lipoprotein cholesterol  (  LDL-c )  and  HbA1c  . Also , CDSS characteristics related to more effective CVRM were identified . Eligible articles were method ologically appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool . We calculated mean differences , relative risks , and if appropriate ( I2 < 70 % ) , pooled the results using a r and om-effects model . Results Of the  14,335 studies identified , 22 were included .  Four studies reported on  SBP  , 3 on  LDL-c  , 10 on  CVRM   in patients with type II diabetes  and 5 on guideline adherence . The CDSSs varied considerably in technical performance and content . Heterogeneity of results was such that quantitative pooling was often not appropriate . Among  CVRM  patients , the results tended towards a beneficial effect of CDSS , but only  LDL-c target attainment  in diabetes patients reached statistical significance . Prompting , integration into the electronical health record , patient empowerment , and medication support were related to more effective  CVRM  . Conclusion We did not find a clear clinical benefit from CDSS in  cardiovascular risk factor levels and target attainment  . Some features of CDSS seem more promising than others . However , the variability in CDSS characteristics and heterogeneity of the results – emphasizing the immaturity of this research area - limit stronger conclusions . Clinical relevance of CDSS in CVRM might additionally be sought in the improvement of shared decision making and patient empowerment."
"eThe present study used a systematic review approach to identify relevant  r and omised control trials ( RCT )  with   vitamin D   and then apply meta-regression to explore the most appropriate model of the   vitamin D  intake-serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) relationship  to underpin setting reference intake values . Methods included an up date d structured search on Ovid MEDLINE ; rigorous inclusion /exclusion criteria ; data extraction ; and meta-regression ( using different model constructs ) . In particular , priority was given to data from  winter-based RCT performed at latitudes > 49·5 ° N ( n 12 ) .  A combined weighted linear model meta-regression analyses of natural log ( Ln  )  total vitamin D  intake ( i.e. diet and supplemental vitamin D )  v. achieved  serum 25(OH)D  in winter ( that used by the North American Dietary Reference Intake Committee ) produced a curvilinear relationship ( mean ( 95 % lower CI ) serum 25(OH)D ( nmol/l ) = 9·2 ( 8·5 ) Ln ( total vitamin D ) ) . Use of non-transformed  total vitamin D intake  data ( maximum 1400 IU/d ; 35 μg/d ) provided for a more linear relationship ( mean serum 25(OH)D ( nmol/l ) = 0·044 × ( total vitamin D)+33·035 ) . Although inputting an intake of 600 IU/d ( i.e. the RDA ) into the 95 % lower CI curvilinear and linear models predicted  a serum  25(OH)D of 54·4 and 55·2 nmol/l , respectively , the   total  vitamin  D intake that would achieve 50 ( and 40 ) nmol/l serum 25(OH)D was 359 ( 111 ) and 480 ( 260 ) IU/d , respectively . Inclusion of 95 % range in the model to account for inter-individual variability increased the  predicted  intake of vitamin D needed to  maintain  serum 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/l to 930 IU/d . The model used to describe the vitamin D intake-status relationship needs to be considered carefully when setting new reference intake values in the Europe."
")BACKGROUND The contribution of  fructose  consumption in Western diets to  overweight and obesity in population s  remains uncertain . PURPOSE To review the effects of  fructose  on  body weight  in controlled feeding trials . DATA SOURCES MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , and the Cochrane Library ( through 18 November 2011 ) . STUDY SELECTION At least 3 review ers identified controlled feeding trials lasting 7 or more days that compared the effect on  body weight  of  free fructose and nonfructose carbohydrate  in diets providing similar calories ( isocaloric trials ) or of diets supplemented with  free fructose  to provide excess energy and usual or control diets ( hypercaloric trials ) . Trials evaluating  high-fructose corn syrup  ( 42 % to 55 %  free fructose )  were excluded . DATA EXTRACTION The review ers independently review ed and extracted relevant data ; disagreements were reconciled by consensus . The Heyl  and  Method ological  Quality Score  was used to assess study quality . DATA SYNTHESIS  Thirty-one isocaloric trials ( 637 participants ) and 10 hypercaloric trials ( 119 participants ) were included ;  studies tended to be  small ( < 15 participants )  ,  short ( < 12 weeks )  , and of low  quality  .  Fructose  had no overall effect on  body weight  in isocaloric trials ( mean difference , -0.14 kg [ 95 % CI , -0.37 to 0.10 kg ] for fructose compared with nonfructose carbohydrate ) . High doses of  fructose  in hypercaloric trials ( + 104 to 250 g/d , + 18 % to 97 % of total daily energy intake ) lead to significant  increases in weight  ( mean difference , 0.53 kg [ CI , 0.26 to 0.79 kg ] with  fructose )  . LIMITATIONS Most trials had method ological limitations and were of poor quality . The  weight-increasing  effect of  fructose  in hypercaloric trials may have been attributable to excess energy rather than fructose itself .   Fructose  does not seem to cause  weight gain  when it is substituted for other carbohydrates in diets providing similar calories .  Free fructose  at high doses that provided excess calories modestly increased  body weight  , an effect that may be due to the extra calories rather than the  fructose .

"sBACKGROUND  Hemostatic agents  have been used clinical ly in dentistry for many years to control  bleeding .  The authors review ed scientific publications in which research ers investigated the effects of   hemostatic agents  on dentin and enamel surfaces  and on bonding of adhesive systems and resin cements . TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEW ED The authors screened  PubMed and Scopus data bases for studies in English published from 1980 to 2013 .  They read the titles and abstract s to identify literature that fulfilled the inclusion criteria . The authors included  studies  in  which research  ers evaluated the  hemostatic action on  the  dentin and enamel surfaces  or its influence on the  bond strength  of  adhesive systems or resin cements  . They used cross-referencing to identify more articles . RESULTS  Twenty in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria  . Investigators in 12 of these studies evaluated the   bond strength   to contaminated  dentin   .  Investigators in 10 of these studies reported a significant decrease in  bond strength .  Those in two studies evaluated the  influence of  a  hemostatic agent  on the  dental enamel  and reported decreases in  bond strength .  Research ers also reported significant increases in  microleakage of  self-etching adhesives   on contaminated dentin . Scanning electron microscopy revealed  partial removal of the smear layer  or an  etching effect of dentin  as a result of the application of hemostatic  agents  on dentin . PRACTICAL IMPLICATION S Adhesive procedures may be affected adversely when performed on dentin and enamel contaminated by hemostatic agents . Hemostatic agents may induce  changes in the dentin surface morphology .  The results of this review indicate that the  bond strength  of self-etching adhesive systems is affected more negatively than is that of etch- and -rinse systems . The authors found that a 60-second application of  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  followed by a  water spray  restored the  bond strength  of a self-etching adhesive to dentin ; use of  phosphoric acid  for 15 seconds followed by a water spray also was an effective cleaning method . Direct comparison of selected studies was not possible , however , mainly because of method ological differences hampering definitive conclusions."
" Too few trial publications report the assumptions underlying their SSC . Most trials were underpowered , ie , power < 0.90 , used inappropriate assumptions for event rates , and were grossly overoptimistic in their expectation of treatment effect . These deficiencies will together have result ed in trials being far too small and reduced their chance of being able to detect real treatment effects."

" Surgery results in greater improvement in  weight loss outcomes and weight associated comorbidities  compared with non-surgical interventions , regardless of the type of procedures used . When compared with each other , certain procedures result ed in greater  weight loss  and  improvements in comorbidities  than others . Outcomes were similar between  RYGB  and sleeve gastrectomy , and both of these procedures had better outcomes than adjustable gastric b and ing . For  people with very high BMI  , biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch result ed in greater  weight loss  than RYGB . Duodenojejunal  bypass with sleeve gastrectomy  and  laparoscopic RYGB  had similar outcomes , however this is based on one small trial .  Isolated sleeve gastrectomy  led to better  weight-loss outcomes  than adjustable gastric b and ing after three years follow-up . This was based on one trial only .  Weight-related outcomes  were similar between  laparoscopic gastric imbrication  and  laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy  in one trial . Across all studies  adverse event rates and reoperation rates  were generally poorly reported . Most trials followed participants for only one or two years , therefore the long-term effects of surgery remain unclear."

">Type  2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )  is one of the most important public health issues .  Vitamin K supplementation  might have favorable effect on risk factors of  T2DM .  The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis of interventional studies to examine the effect of  vitamin K supplementation  on glycemic indices . A systematic search was performed in electronic data bases including PubMed , Science Direct , ProQuest , Institute of Scientific Information Web of Science , and Google scholar up to July 2017 . We used a r and om effects model to estimate  pooled effect size of fasting blood sugar ( FBS ) , 2-h oral glucose tolerance test ( 2-h OGTT ) , fasting insulin ( FINS ) , and homeostasis model assessment -estimated insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR )  .  Five clinical trials ( 533 participants )  fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present meta- analysis . Overall , meta- analysis could not show any  beneficial effect   of vitamin  K  supplementation on FBS  ( -0.91 mg/dl , 95 % CI : -2.57 , 0.76 , p=0.28 ) , FINS ( -0.35 μIU/ml , 95 % CI : -1.70 , 1.00 , p=0.61  ) ,  HOMA-IR ( -0.06 , 95 % CI : -0.32 , -0.19 , p=0.63 ) ,  and 2-h  OGTT ( -4.00 mg/dl , 95 % CI : -20.00 , 11.99 , p=0.62 ) . Sensitivity analysis showed that overall estimates were not affected by elimination of any study . We did not observe any evidence regarding publication bias . In  conclusion , vitamin K  supplementation had  no signiﬁcant effect on glycemic control  in  healthy subjects .  However , further studies should be performed on  diabetic and pre-diabetic patients  to determine the   effect  of  vitamin K  supplementation on impaired glycemic control ."

"nOBJECTIVE To review the evidence for the effectiveness of  exercise therapy  and to estimate the additional effect of supervision on  exercise therapy  in  patients with intermittent claudication .  MATERIAL S AND METHODS A systematic review was performed of all r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing  supervised exercise therapy  to  unsupervised exercise regimens  or  observation  in  patients with intermittent claudication .  Main endpoints were  pain free walking distance ( PWD ) and absolute walking distance ( AWD ) .  Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two observers . RESULTS  Fifteen manuscripts , published between 1990 and May 2006  ,  were eligible for analysis , evaluating 761 patients .  In the studies comparing  supervised exercise  to st and ard care the weighted mean difference in  pain free walking distance ( PWD ) and absolute walking distance ( AWD )  was 81.3meters ( 95 % CI ; 35.5 - 127.1 ) and 155.8meters ( 95 % CI ; 80.8 - 230.7 ) , respectively . In the studies comparing  supervised to unsupervised exercise therapy  , the weighted mean difference  in PWD and AWD  was 143.8meters ( 95 % CI ; 5.8 - 281.8 ) and 250.4meters ( 95 % CI ; 192.4 - 308.5 ) .   Exercise therapy  increases the  PWD and AWD   in patients with intermittent claudication .   Supervised exercise therapy  increases the  PWD and AWD  more than st and ard care . However , the additional value of supervision over  unsupervised exercise regimens  needs further clarification."
">Risk stratification is essential for both clinical risk prediction and comparative audit . There are a variety of  risk stratification tools  available for use in major  noncardiac surgery  , but their discrimination and calibration have not previously been systematic ally review ed in heterogeneous patient cohorts . Embase , MEDLINE , and Web of Science were search ed for  studies published between January 1 , 1980 and August 6 , 2011 in adult patients undergoing major noncardiac , nonneurological surgery  .  Twenty-seven studies evaluating 34 risk stratification tools were  identified which met inclusion criteria . The  Portsmouth-Physiology and Operative Severity Score  for the  enUmeration of Mortality and the Surgical Risk Scale  were demonstrated to be the most consistently accurate tools that have been vali date d in multiple studies ; however , both have limitations . Future work should focus on further evaluation of these and other parsimonious risk predictors , including validation in international cohorts . There is also a need for studies examining the impact that the use of these tools has on  clinical decision making  and  patient outcome ."
"rBipolar disorder is characterized by chronic and recurrent symptoms including mania , hypomania , and depressive and mixed episodes , with approximately 5.7 million Americans  over  age 18 , or 2.6 % of the U.S. population , suffering from the illness . The prevalence of the disorder may be higher due to its chronic and recurrent nature .  Individuals with bipolar disorder  often first present in general medical setting s with depressive symptomatology .  Long-term management  typically occurs in mental health setting s by psychiatrists or other mental health specialists . While there have been major advances in pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder , evidence -based information on drug effectiveness is not always easily accessible to prescribers in daily practice . Available information has sometimes led to inappropriate use of various classes of drugs , specifically  antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs )  , for bipolar disorder . Originally approved in 1993 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) only for adjunctive treatment of partial complex seizures , the manufacturer of  gabapentin ( Neurontin )  , an  AED  , promoted its off-label use for treatment of psychiatric disorders , including bipolar disorder . The  efficacy  of the drug for this indication had not been demonstrated , nor had the manufacturer sought FDA approval for the indication . In 2004 , 50 Attorneys General settled consumer protection cl aims regarding alleged deceptive off-label marketing practice s of Pfizer subsidiary Warner-Lambert . At about the same time , a consortium of State Medicaid agencies funded a drug class review to compare  effectiveness and adverse event profiles  of AEDs in the treatment of  bipolar mood disorder , neuropathic pain , and fibromyalgia .  This article presents a summary of the findings from the drug class review related to prescription of the AEDs in bipolar disorder."
"eHypertension , an elevation of systemic  arterial blood pressure  (  BP )  , is a very common chronic disease in the United States . The overall prevalence of hypertension among  U.S. adults  is 29.0 % , and it increases to 64.9 % in  adults aged 60 years or older  ( 1 ) . Hypertension was associated with a total of $ 46 billion in health care services , medications , and missed days of work in the United States in 2011 ( 2 ) . Appropriate management of hypertension reduces the risk for  cardiovascular disease , renal disease , cerebrovascular disease  , and  death  ( 36 ) . However , determining the most appropriate BP targets , particularly for  adults aged 60 years or older  , has been controversial . Debate about the goal for  systolic BP ( SBP )  among adults treated for hypertension has intensified , especially in light of recent recommendations ( 7 ) . In addition , when selecting BP targets for  adults aged 60  years  or  older , clinicians need to consider comorbid conditions that could affect treatment choice . Treatments for hypertension include  lifestyle modifications , such as weight loss , dietary modification , and increased physical activity , and antihypertensive medications , which commonly include thiazide-type diuretics , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) , angiotensin-receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , calcium-channel blockers , and -blockers .  Supplement . Original Version ( PDF ) Guideline Focus and Target Population The purpose of this American College of Physicians ( ACP ) and American Academy of Family Physicians ( AAFP ) joint guideline is to present evidence -based recommendations on the benefits and harms of higher ( < 150 mm Hg ) versus lower ( 140 mm  Hg ) SBP  targets for the treatment of hypertension in  adults aged 60 years or older  . The target audience for this guideline includes all  clinicians  , and the  target patient population includes adults aged 60 years or older with hypertension .  These recommendations are based on a background evidence review ( 8) and systematic review sponsored by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) ( 9 ) . Methods Systematic Review of the Evidence The evidence review was conducted by the Portl and VA Health Care System Evidence -based Synthesis Program . The summary of methods for the evidence review can be found in the Appendix . Additional details are included in the accompanying background evidence review ( 8) and the full evidence report ( 9 ) . Grading the Evidence and Developing Recommendations This guideline was jointly developed by ACP 's Clinical Guidelines Committee and representatives from AAFP according to ACP 's guideline development process , details of which can be found in the methods paper ( 10 ) . The committee used the evidence tables in the accompanying systematic review ( 8) and full report ( 9 ) when reporting the evidence and grade d the recommendations using the GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ) method ( Table ) . Table . The American College of Physicians ' Guideline Grading System * Peer Review The VA evidence review was peer review ed and posted on the VA Web site for public comments , and the published review article was peer review ed through the journal . The guideline had a peer- review process through the journal and was posted online for comments from ACP Regents and Governors , who represent physician members at the national and international level . The guideline was also review ed by members of AAFP 's Commission on Health of the Public and Science . Benefits of Treating Higher Versus Lower BP Targets in Older Adults Across all trials , treating high BP in older adults was beneficial . However , most of the evidence came from studies  of patients with moderate or severe hypertension ( SBP > 160 mm Hg ) at baseline and , with treatment , achieved SBP targets greater than 140 mm Hg .  Differing BP Targets Moderate- quality evidence showed a reduction in  all-cause mortality  among  patients  with a  baseline SBP  of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP of less than 150 mm Hg , although the reductions did not quite reach statistical significance ( relative risk [ RR ] , 0.93 [ 95 % CI , 0.85 to 1.00 ] ; absolute risk reduction [ ARR ] , 1.13 ) . High- quality evidence showed  reductions in stroke  ( RR , 0.77 [ CI , 0.64 to 0.91 ] ; ARR , 0.92 ) , and  cardiac events  ( RR , 0.83 [ CI , 0.71 to 0.96 ] ; ARR , 0.72)(1121 ) . In studies with lower SBP targets ( < 140 mm Hg ) , low- quality evidence showed no statistically significant  reduction in all-cause mortality  ( RR , 0.93 [ CI , 0.75 to 1.14 ] ; ARR , 0.21),cardiac  events  ( RR , 0.91 [ CI , 0.77 to 1.04 ] ; ARR , 0.35),or  stroke  ( RR , 0.86 [ CI , 0.64 to 0.1.07 ] ; ARR , 0.19 ) ( 1113 , 20 , 22 , 23 ) . For studies with lower BP targets , moderate- quality evidence showed a  reduced risk for stroke  ( RR , 0.79 [ CI , 0.59 to 0.99 ] ; ARR , 0.49 ) compared with higher BP targets ( 1113 , 20 , 22 , 23 ) . Many of these studies , however , did not achieve the targeted BP , and there was little difference between the intensive treatment and control groups . Therefore , these studies may not have been able to detect differences in clinical outcomes . A subgroup analysis compared studies  that achieved lower SBP targets ( < 140 mm Hg )  with those  that achieved higher SBP targets  (  140 mm Hg )  (  1113  , 20 , 2225 ) . For these subgroups , high- quality evidence showed a similar  risk reduction for mortality  ( RR for target 140 mm Hg , 0.91 [ CI , 0.84 to 0.99 ] vs. RR for target < 140 mm Hg , 0.84 [ CI , 0.74 to 0.95 ] ) and  cardiac events  ( RR for target 140 mm Hg , 0.78 [ CI , 0.68 to 0.93 ] vs. RR for target < 140 mm Hg , 0.83 [ CI , 0.70 to 0.94 ] ) .  The relative reduction in stroke events  was slightly larger for studies that achieved a target  SBP  of 140 mm Hg or greater ( RR , 0.72 [ CI , 0.62 to 0.82 ] ) than those that achieved a target SBP of less than 140 mm Hg ( RR , 0.81 [ CI , 0.66 to 0.96 ] ) . These studies had marked clinical differences and significant statistical heterogeneity , which should temper confidence in the pooled results . Use of antihypertensive  agents  varied widely across studies : 7 used  ACEIs or ARBs  , 5 used  calcium-channel blockers  , and 6 used  thiazide-like diuretics .  Differing BP  Targets in Patients With Transient Ischemic Attack or Stroke Among patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA )  , moderate- quality evidence showed that treating to an SBP of 130 to 140 mm Hg  reduced stroke recurrence  ( RR , 0.76 [ CI , 0.66 to 0.92 ] ; ARR , 3.02 ) but not  cardiac events  ( RR , 0.78 [ CI , 0.61 to 1.08 ] ) or  all-cause mortality  ( RR , 0.98 [ CI , 0.85 to 1.19 ] ) ( 26 , 27 ) . Heterogeneity for this analysis was low . Differing BP Targets Based on Age Low- quality evidence showed similar effects across  different age groups ( 1214 , 16 , 1820 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 29 ) .  A subgroup analysis of SPRINT (  Systolic Blood Pressure  Intervention Trial ) that was not included in the evidence review showed that  patients aged 75 years or older  had lower  all-cause mortality  and nonstatistically significantly lower  cardiovascular mortality , morbidity , and incidence of stroke  with treatment to  SBP targets  less than 120 mm Hg compared with SBP  targets  less than 140 mm Hg ( 30 ) . Differing BP Targets Based on Multiple Chronic Conditions No trials assessed the effect of comorbidity on the benefits of more aggressive BP treatment . Low- quality evidence from subgroup analyses showed greater absolute benefit from more intensive  BP treatment  in  patients with high cardiovascular risk ( 22 , 2931 ) .  However ,  patients with a high comorbidity burden  were probably not included in the overall group of studies ( 8) . Of the  21 trials included in the review , 14 excluded patients with heart failure , 11 excluded those with recent cardiovascular events , 17 excluded those with abnormal renal function , 12 excluded those with cancer or other life-limiting illness , 15 had criteria that would implicitly or explicitly exclude those with dementia or diminished functional status , and 7 excluded either all diabetic patients or those who required  insulin .   Although findings from ACCORD ( Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ) , which limited enrollment to  patients with type 2  diabetes , found no reduction in  mortality or major cardiovascular events  with more intensive treatment , a subgroup analysis of  7 studies ( 12 , 14 , 1820 , 28 , 29 ) in diabetic patients  suggested that they were at least as likely to benefit from BP-lowering treatment . This is probably related to the higher frequency of  cardiovascular events  seen in these patients . Treatment Effects According to Diastolic BP Evidence was insufficient to determine the benefit of treating diastolic  hypertension  in the absence of systolic hypertension . Most trials assessed treatment outcomes based on  SBP  , and no trials included patients with a   mean  diastolic BP  ( DBP ) greater than 90 mm Hg and a mean SBP less than 140 mm Hg . Harms of Higher Versus Lower BP Targets in  Older Adults  Studies showed mixed findings for  withdrawal  due to  adverse events .  Treatment to lower BP targets increased  withdrawals due to adverse events  in 4 out of 10 trials ( RR , 44 % to 100 % ) ;  cough and hypotension  were the most frequently reported adverse events ( 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 24 , 27 , 29 , 31 , 32 ) . Low- quality evidence showed an  increased risk for syncope  associated with treatment to lower BP targets ( achieved SBP range , 121.5 to 143 mm Hg ) ( RR , 1.52 [ CI , 1.22 to 2.07 ] ) ( 18 , 23 , 28 ) . Low- quality evidence showed no difference in  renal outcomes ( including end-stage renal disease )  for treatment to higher versus lower BP targets ( 13 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 2225 , 28 , 29 , 3234 ) . Moderate- quality evidence showed no differences between treatment to higher versus lower BP targets in the  degree of cognitive decline or dementia  ( 18 , 27 , 3539 ) ,  fractures  ( 40 , 41 ) , or  quality of life  ( 17 , 4244 ) . Low- quality evidence showed no difference for treatment to higher versus lower BP targets on  functional status  ( 42 ) or the  risk for falls  ( 23 , 40 ) .

Non-invasive anaesthetic drugs and anaesthetic procedures  can be used to provide  pain relief  and  increase patient satisfaction and treatment efficacy .  However , it remains unclear which method provides the best  pain relief .  The objective of this systematic review was therefore to assess the  efficacy and safety  of  non-invasive anaesthetic methods  during  dermatological  laser procedures .   A systematic literature search was conducted . R and omized and non-r and  omized  controlled clinical trials ( RCTs and CCTs ) were included . Two authors independently assessed study eligibility , extracted data and assessed the risk of bias . The quality of evidence was rated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) .  Twenty RCTs and 12 CCTs were included , involving nine different laser indications : hair removal ( n = 9 ) , resurfacing/rejuvenation ( n = 5 ) , port wine stains ( n = 8) , leg telangiectasia ( n = 3 ) , facial telangiectasia ( n = 2 ) , tattoo removal ( n = 2 )  ,  naevus of Ota ( n =  1  )  ,  solar lentigines (  n = 1 )  and HPV  lesions ( n = 1 ) . The  non-invasive anaesthetic methods  ( i.e.  topical anaesthetic drugs , skin cooling , and pneumatic skin flattening [ PSF ] )  ,  types of lasers , laser setting s , application time , and types of pain scales  varied widely among the included studies . All of the studies had an unclear or high risk of bias , and the overall quality of evidence was rated as low . In general , active  non-invasive anaesthetic  methods seemed to provide favourable results compared to  placebo  or  no anaesthesia  , and topical  anaesthetic drugs  and PSF seemed to result in a better  pain reduction  than skin cooling . However , the current evidence is insufficient to provide recommendations for daily clinical practice . There is a need for more high- quality ( head-to-head ) RCTs . Future studies should also evaluate sex differences in pain perception , have uniformity with regard to vali date d pain  measurement  scales and address clinical ly significant differences in  pain reduction  besides statistically significant differences."
"dLeaders from the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology convened representatives of national organizations , content experts , method ologists , stakeholders , and end-users who followed rigorous and transparent guideline development procedures to create the Canadian  24-Hour Movement Guidelines  for  Children and Youth :  An Integration of Physical Activity , Sedentary Behaviour , and Sleep . These novel guidelines for  children and youth aged 5 - 17 years  respect the natural and intuitive integration of movement behaviours across the whole day ( 24-h period ) . The development process was guided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research Evaluation ( AGREE ) II instrument and systematic review s of evidence informing the guidelines were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach . Four systematic review s  ( physical activity , sedentary behaviour , sleep , integrated behaviours )  examining the relationships between and among movement behaviours and several  health indicators  were completed and interpreted by expert consensus . Complementary compositional analyses were performed using  Canadian Health Measures Survey  data to examine the relationships between  movement behaviours and health indicators .  A  stakeholder survey was employed ( n = 590 )  and  28 focus groups/stakeholder interviews ( n = 104 )  were completed to gather feedback on draft guidelines . Following an introductory preamble , the guidelines provide evidence -informed recommendations for a healthy day ( 24 h ) , comprising a combination of sleep , sedentary behaviours , light- , moderate- , and vigorous-intensity physical activity . Proactive dissemination , promotion , implementation , and evaluation plans have been prepared in an effort to optimize uptake and activation of the new guidelines . Future research should consider the integrated relationships among movement behaviours , and similar integrated guidelines for other  age groups  should be developed."
"  Alprazolam  appears to reduce  depressive symptoms  more effectively than  placebo  and as effectively as  tricyclic antidepressants .  However , the studies included in the review were heterogeneous , of poor quality and only addressed short-term effects , thus limiting our confidence in the findings . Whilst the  rate of all-cause withdrawals  did not appear to differ between  alprazolam  and  placebo  , and  withdrawals  were less frequent in the  alprazolam  group than in any of the conventional antidepressants combined group , these findings should be interpreted with caution , given the dependency properties of benzodiazepines."
" Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of  coloured lenses or overlays  to ameliorate  reading difficulties  can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects."

"sSelective  serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs )  are recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment for depression and are the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants . However , there is substantial evidence that noradrenaline has a role in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression . This review aims to examine the evidence of including  noradrenaline  reuptake inhibition with  serotonin reuptake inhibition  with respect to increasing  efficacy  in the treatment of  depression .  Evidence from meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) and r and omised pragmatic trials was found in support of greater  efficacy  of the  serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , venlafaxine and duloxetine  , in moderate to severe depression compared to  SSRIs  but no evidence was found for superiority of  milnacipran .  There is sufficient current evidence that demonstrates an increase in  efficacy  , when noradrenaline reuptake is added to serotonin ( 5-HT ) reuptake , to suggest that  patients with severe depression or those who have failed to reach remission with a SSRI  may benefit from treatment with a  SNRI .  However , as these conclusions are drawn from the evidence derived from meta-analyses and pragmatic trials , large adequately powered RCTs using optimal dosing regimens and clinical ly relevant outcome measures in severe depression and SSRI treatment failures are still required to confirm these findings."
"aPurpose To provide recommendations for the management options for  patients with small renal masses ( SRMs ) .  Methods By using a literature search and prospect ively defined study selection , we sought systematic review s , meta-analyses , r and omized clinical trials , prospect i ve comparative  observational  studies , and retrospective studies published from  2000 through 2015  . Outcomes included  recurrence-free survival , disease-specific survival , and overall survival .  Results  Eighty-three studies , including 20 systematic review s and 63 primary studies  , met the eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the guideline recommendations . Recommendations On the basis of tumor-specific findings and competing risks of mortality , all  patients with an SRM  should be considered for a biopsy when the results may alter management . Active surveillance should be an initial management option for patients who have significant comorbidities and limited life expectancy .  Partial nephrectomy ( PN )  for SRMs is the st and ard treatment that should be offered to all  patients for whom an intervention is indicated and who possess a tumor that is amenable to this approach .   Percutaneous thermal ablation  should be considered an option if complete ablation can reliably be achieved .  Radical nephrectomy  for SRMs should only be reserved for  patients  who  possess a tumor of significant complexity that  is  not amenable to PN  or for whom PN may result in unacceptable  morbidity  even when performed at centers with expertise . Referral to a nephrologist should be considered if  chronic kidney  disease ( estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) or  progressive chronic kidney disease  occurs after treatment , especially if associated with proteinuria."
" Although most available studies did not systematic ally evaluate feasibility aspects , reports of high participation rates , low drop-out rates , absence of  adverse  events and positive training experiences suggest that  biofeedback  methods can be applied in older adults . Effectiveness was evaluated based on 21 studies , mostly of moderate quality . An indication for effectiveness of visual feedback-based training of balance in ( frail ) older adults was identified for  postural sway , weight-shifting and reaction time in st and ing  , and for the  Berg Balance Scale .  Indications for added effectiveness of applying  biofeedback  during training of balance , gait , or sit-to-st and transfers in  older patients  post-stroke were identified for training-specific aspects . The same applies for auditory feedback-based training of gait in older patients with lower-limb surgery . Implication sFurther appropriate studies are needed in different population s of  older adults  to be able to make definitive statements regarding the ( long-term ) added effectiveness , particularly on measures of functioning."

"sBackground  Rehabilitation approaches  for  people with rheumatoid arthritis  include  joint protection , exercises and self-management strategies . Health interventions delivered via the web  have the potential to improve access to health services overcoming time constraints , physical limitations , and socioeconomic and geographic barriers . The objective of this review is to determine the effects of  web-based rehabilitation interventions  in  adults with rheumatoid arthritis .  Methods  R and omised controlled trials that  compared   web-based  rehabilitation interventions  with  usual care , waiting list , no treatment or another web-based intervention   in adults with rheumatoid arthritis  were  included  . The outcomes were  pain , function , quality of life , self-efficacy , rheumatoid arthritis knowledge , physical activity and adverse effects .  Method ological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and quality of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation approach . Results Six source documents from  four trials ( n = 567 )  focusing on self-management , health information or physical activity were identified . The effects of  web-based rehabilitation interventions  on  pain , function , quality of life , self-efficacy , rheumatoid arthritis knowledge and physical activity  are uncertain because of the very low quality of evidence mostly from small single trials .  Adverse effects  were not reported . Conclusion Large , well- design ed trials are needed to evaluate the  clinical and cost-effectiveness  of  web-based rehabilitation interventions  in rheumatoid arthritis."
"   MCID   for chronic pain relief vary considerably . Baseline pain is strongly associated with absolute , but not relative , measures . To a much lesser degree , MCID is also influenced by the operational definition of relevant pain relief and possibly by clinical condition . Explicit and conscientious reflections on the choice of an  MCID  are required when classifying effect sizes as clinical ly important or trivial."
"yABSTRACT  Genotropin ( somatropin )  is licensed for the treatment of  children with growth hormone deficiency , Prader-Willi syndrome , Turner syndrome , chronic renal insufficiency and in children born small for gestational age .  This systematic review ( SR ) evaluated the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of  Genotropin  in these conditions to inform a NICE Technology Appraisal of growth hormone for the treatment of growth failure in  children .  Search terms were used to search seven data bases , including Medline and Embase , for English language studies . R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) or observational studies investigating  Genotropin  in  children  were included . Out of 30 RCTs identified , one reported  final height data .  Eleven observational studies reported  final height  and seven were based on the Pfizer International Growth Survey ( KIGS ) . This SR highlights the lack of long-term RCTs reporting  final height data  and other important  qualitative  outcomes , such as  quality of life .  Observational data , such as those from KIGS , remain vital for informing therapy."

">Major reported factors associated with the limited effectiveness of  home telemonitoring interventions  in chronic respiratory  conditions  include the lack of useful early predictors , poor patient compliance and the poor performance of conventional algorithms for detecting deteriorations . This article provides a systematic review of existing algorithms and the factors associated with their performance in detecting exacerbations and supporting clinical decisions in  patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) or asthma .  An electronic literature search in Medline , Scopus , Web of Science and Cochrane library was conducted to identify relevant articles  published between 2005 and July 2015 .  A total of  20 studies ( 16 COPD , 4 asthma ) that included  research about the use of  algorithms  in  telemonitoring interventions  in  asthma and COPD were selected .  Differences on the applied definition of exacerbation , telemonitoring duration , acquired physiological signals and symptoms , type of technology deployed and algorithms used were found . Predictive models with good clinical ly reliability have yet to be defined , and are an important goal for the future development of telehealth in chronic respiratory conditions . New predictive models incorporating both  symptoms  and  physiological signals  are being tested in telemonitoring interventions with positive outcomes . However , the underpinning algorithms behind these models need be vali date d in larger sample s of patients , for longer periods of time and with well-established protocol s. In addition , further research is needed to identify novel predictors that enable the early  detection of deteriorations  , especially in COPD . Only then will  telemonitoring  achieve the aim of preventing  hospital admissions  , contributing to the reduction of  health re source utilization  and  improving the quality of life of patients ."

"nThe aim of this study was to examine the use of  pedometers  as a tool to promote daily  physical activity  levels in  patients with COPD .A  systematic review meta- analysis of  pedometer physical activity promotion  in  patients with COPD  was conducted . Medline / PubMed , Cochrane Library , Web of Science and CINAHL were search ed from inception to January 2019 . The search strategy included the following keywords :  physical activity  promotion , pulmonary rehabilitation and daily physical activity . The eligibility criteria for selecting studies were r  and omised  controlled trials reporting  pedometer physical activity  promotion  in patients with COPD .Improvements  in  steps per day  were found with  pedometer physical activity promotion  either st and alone ( n=12 , mean 0.53 ( 95 % CI 0.29 - 0.77 ) ; p=0.00001 ) or alongside pulmonary rehabilitation ( n=7 , 0.51 ( 0.13 - 0.88 ) ; p=0.006 ) . A subgroup analysis reported significant differences in the  promotion of physical activity  based  on baseline physical activity levels  and the  type of instrument used to assess levels of physical activity .  Future trials should consider the way in which  pedometers  are used to promote  physical activity  to inform clinical practice in the setting of pulmonary rehabilitation."
"0INTRODUCTION Stroke is a leading health problem worldwide and an important cause of disability .  Stroke survivors  show low levels of physical activity , and increases in physical activity levels may improve function and health status . Therefore , the aims are to identify which interventions that have been employed to increase  physical activity levels  with  stroke survivors  , to verify their efficacy and to identify the gaps in the literature . METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of r and omised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of  interventions  aim ing at increasing physical  activity  levels of  stroke survivors  will be conducted . Electronic search es will be performed in the MEDLINE , Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) , Excerpta Medica ( EMBASE ) , Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde ( LILACS ) and Scientific Electronic Library Online ( SCIELO ) data bases . H and search es of the reference lists of the included studies or relevant review s will also be employed . Two independent review ers will screen all the retrieved titles , abstract s and full texts . A third review er will be referred to solve any disagreements . The quality of the included studies will be assessed by the  PEDro Rating Scale  . This systematic review will also include a qualitative synthesis . Meta-analyses will be performed , if the studies are sufficiently homogeneous . This review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis ( PRISMA ) statement . The  quality of the evidence  regarding  physical activity  will be assessed , according to the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE )  . DISCUSSION This systematic review will provide information on which interventions are effective for increasing  physical activity levels  of  stroke survivors  . This evidence may be important for clinical decision-making and will allow the identification of gaps in the literature that may be useful for the definition of future research goals and the planning of new trials .

 Telemonitoring interventions  may be a better option than  usual care  in  improving glycated haemoglobin control  of  patients with type 2 diabetes .  Further studies should assess clinical benefit according to specific delivery modes of the intervention and patient-reported outcomes.
"aA number of clinical trials have examined the effect of  l-arginine  on  lipid profile  in recent years ; however , the results remain equivocal . Therefore , the present study aims to summarise and quantitatively examine the available evidence on the effectiveness  l-arginine supplementation  on  lipid parameters  using a systematic review and meta-analytic approach . Online data bases including PubMed , Scopus , ISI Web of Science , Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were search ed up to April 2019 for r and omised controlled trials that examined the  effect of  l-arginine supplementation  on lipid profile in adults .  Treatment effects were expressed as weighted mean difference ( WMD ) and the corresponding st and ard error in concentrations of serum lipids . To estimate the overall effect  of l-arginine supplementation  , we used the r and om-effects model . In total ,  twelve studies were included in the systematic review .  The meta- analysis revealed  that l-arginine  supplementation did not significantly change  the concentrations of total cholesterol  ( WMD : -5·03 mg/dl ; 95 % CI -10·78 , 0·73 ; P = 0·08 ; inconsistency index ( I2 ) = 39·0 %  )  ,  LDL  ( WMD : -0·47 mg/dl ; 95 % CI -3·61 , 2·66 ; P = 0·76 ; I2 = 0·0 % ) ,  or  HDL ( WMD : 0·57 mg/dl ; 95 % CI -1·28 , 2·43 ; P = 0·54 ; I2 = 68·4 % ) . A significant reduction was observed  only in serum TAG levels  ( WMD : -7·04 mg/dl ; 95 % CI -11·42 , -2·67 ; P < 0·001 ; I2 = 0·0 % ) . This meta- analysis concludes  that l-arginine supplementation  can  significantly reduce blood TAG levels  ; however , there is insufficient evidence to support  its hypocholesterolaemic  effects . To draw straightforward conclusions regarding generalised recommendations  for l-arginine supplementation  for improving  lipid  profile , there is a need for more well-controlled trials targeting exclusively patients with dyslipidaemia."
"eAIM To perform a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to evaluate the effect of   probiotics  in pregnancy on  the   incidence of gestational diabetes ( GDM ) and  fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) .  METHODS A MEDLINE , EMBASE , Scopus and Cochrane search ( up to May 30th , 2019 ) was performed to identify RCTs of comparison of  probiotics with placebo/active comparators   in pregnant women .  Principal endpoints were the  incidence of GDM and the change of FPG .  Other maternal  and  fetal  outcomes  were secondary endpoints .  Mantel-Haenszel Odds Ratio  with 95 %  CI (  MH-OR ) was calculated for dichotomous outcomes , whereas st and ardized differences in means was calculated for continuous variables . ( PROSPERO registration CRD42019139889 ) . FINDINGS A total of 17 RCTs , all versus placebo , was identified . The overall quality of the trials was satisfactory . No effect of  probiotics  on  incidence of GDM  ( MH-OR : 0.77[0.51,1.16 ] , p=0.21,I2:62 % ) was observed , with a small but significant reduction of  FPG  ( mean difference -1.01 [-1.96,-0.06]mg/dl , p= 0.02 , I2:46 % ) . Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of  maternal insulin  ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the  probiotics group .  INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the  incidence of GDM  , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose."
"yThe incorporation of  functional monomers  in  dental  adhesive systems promotes chemical interaction with dental substrates , result ing in higher adhesion forces when compared to micromechanical adhesion only . The  10-MDP monomer  , whose chemical structure allows for a polar behavior which is favorable to adhesion , also promotes the protection of collagen fibers through the formation of MDP-calcium salts . This systematic review aim ed to characterize the interface created by  10-MDP containing adhesive systems  through an evaluation of the following parameters : Formation of nano-layered structures , capacity to produce an acid-base resistant zone , and adhesion stability . The research was conducted using PubMed , Cochrane Library , Web of Science and Embase , limited  to English , Spanish , and Portuguese articles .  The research was done according to the PICO strategy . The  10-MDP monomer  has the capacity to produce an acid-base resistant zone on the adhesive interface , which increases the  response to acid-base challenges .  The  adhesion  established by these systems is stable over time . To have the best of these adhesive solutions , a scrubbing technique must be used to apply the adhesive system on dental substrates , in order to improve monomers infiltration and to create a stable bond . Time must be given for the solution to infiltrate , hybridize and form the MDP-Ca , improving adhesive stability."

"rBACKGROUND Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in  adults .  Screening for abnormalities by  using resting or exercise electrocardiography ( ECG )  might help identify  persons who would benefit from interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk .  PURPOSE To up date the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence review on screening for   resting or exercise ECG  abnormalities in asymptomatic adults .  DATA SOURCES MEDLINE  ( 2002 through  January  2011 )  , the Cochrane Library data base ( through the  fourth  quarter of 2010  )  , and reference lists . STUDY SELECTION R and omized , controlled trials and prospect i ve cohort studies . DATA EXTRACTION Investigators abstract ed details about the study population , study design , data analysis , follow-up , and results and assessed quality by using predefined criteria . DATA SYNTHESIS No study evaluated clinical outcomes or use of risk-reducing therapies after  screening versus no screening .  No study estimated how accurately   resting or exercise electrocardiography   classified participants into high- , intermediate- , or low-risk groups , compared with traditional risk factor assessment alone .  Sixty-three prospect i ve cohort studies  evaluated  abnormalities on resting or  exercise  ECG  as predictors of  cardiovascular events  after adjustment for traditional risk factors .  Abnormalities on  resting ECG  ( ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities , left ventricular hypertrophy , bundle branch block , or left-axis deviation )  or   exercise ECG  ( ST-segment depression with exercise , chronotropic incompetence , abnormal heart rate recovery , or decreased exercise capacity )  were associated with increased risk ( pooled hazard ratio estimates , 1.4 to 2.1 ) . Evidence on  harms  was limited , but direct  harms  seemed minimal ( for resting ECG ) or small ( for exercise ECG ) . No study estimated  harms  from subsequent testing or interventions , although  rates  of  angiography  after exercise ECG ranged from 0.6 % to 2.9 % . LIMITATIONS Only English- language studies were included . Statistical heterogeneity was present in several of the pooled analyses .   Abnormalities  on  resting or  exercise  ECG  are associated with an increased  risk  for  subsequent cardiovascular events  after adjustment for traditional risk factors , but the clinical implication s of these findings are unclear."
" Increased  TFA  intake does not result in  changes in glucose , insulin , or triglyceride concentrations  but leads to an  increase in total and LDL-cholesterol and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol concentrations .

" Limited evidence from r and omized trials and observational studies found a reduction in  mortality and cardiovascular events  with  anticoagulants  compared to  controls .  This evidence should be interpreted with caution . Although oral  anticoagulation  is indicated in certain groups of  patients with heart failure  ( e.g.  atrial fibrillation )  , the available data do not support its routine use in heart failure patients who remain in sinus rhythm."
"dResearch ers have generally considered  autistic individuals  to have difficulties generalising learned  skills  across novel context s. Successful generalisation is necessary for an intervention to have benefits in everyday life beyond the original learning environment . We conducted a systematic review of r and omised controlled trials of  early social communication interventions  for  children with autism  in order to explore generalisation and its measurement . We identified nine RCTs that provided evidence of initial target learning and measured  generalisation  , of which eight demonstrated at least some  successful generalisation  across people , setting s , and /or activities . The findings did not support the widely reported  generalisation ' difficulties '  associated with autism . However ,  generalisation  was not consistent across all skills within studies , and one study found no generalisation despite evidence for initial target learning within the intervention context . In general , there are few method ologically sound  social communication intervention  studies exploring generalisation in autism and no consensus on how it should be measured . In particular , failure to demonstrate  initial learning  of  target skills  within the intervention setting and an absence of formal mediation analyses of the hypothesised mechanisms limit current research . We outline a framework within which measurement of  generalisation  can be considered for use in future trials . To maximise the effectiveness of interventions , the field needs to gain a better underst and ing of the nature of generalisation among  autistic individuals  and what additional strategies may further enhance learning . Autism Res 2019 , 00 : 1 - 17 . © 2019 International Society for Autism Research , Wiley Periodicals , Inc. LAY SUMMARY : It is generally considered that  autistic individuals  experience difficulties applying things they have learned in one context into different setting s ( e.g. from school to home ) . This is important to consider for intervention studies . Our review does not support a complete lack of generalisation but instead suggests that  after early social communication intervention  ,  autistic children  can transfer some  skills  to new context s. Overall , there is limited research in this area and further work is needed."

"sThe aim of the present study is to assess the  comparative efficacy  of different  dietary approaches  on  glycaemic control  in  patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  using a systematic review of the literature . Electronic and h and search es were performed until July 2017 . The inclusion criteria were defined as follows : ( 1 )  r and omized trial with a  dietary approach  ;  (  2 ) adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus ;  ( 3 ) outcome either HbA1c ( % ) and /or fasting glucose ( mmol/l ) ; ( 4 ) minimum intervention period of 12 weeks . For each outcome measure , r and om effects network meta- analysis was performed in order to determine the pooled effect of each intervention relative to each of the other interventions . A total of  56 trials comparing nine  dietary approaches  ( low-fat , Vegetarian , Mediterranean , high-protein , moderate-carbohydrate , low-carbohydrate , control  , low GI/GL ,  Palaeolithic ) enrolling 4937 participants were included .  For  reducing HbA1c  , the  low-carbohydrate diet  was ranked as the best dietary approach ( SUCRA : 84 % ) , followed by the  Mediterranean diet  ( 80 % ) and  Palaeolithic diet  ( 76 % ) compared to a control diet . For  reducing fasting glucose  , the  Mediterranean diet  ( 88 % ) was ranked as the best approach , followed by  Palaeolithic diet  ( 71 % ) and  Vegetarian diet  ( 63 % ) . The network analysis also revealed that all dietary approaches  significantly reduce HbA1c  ( − 0.82 to − 0.47 % reduction )  and fasting  glucose ( − 1.61 to − 1.00 mmol/l reduction ) compared to a control diet . According to the network meta- analysis the Mediterranean diet  is the most effective and efficacious dietary approach to improve glycaemic control  in type 2 diabetes patients."

" Due to a paucity of studies , and the heterogeneity of the studies included in this review , we are unable to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of  nutritional interventions  for use with  childhood cancer survivors .  Although there is low quality evidence for the improvement in  health behaviours  using  health behaviour change interventions  , there remains no evidence as to whether this translates into an  improvement  in  dietary intake .  There was also no evidence that the studies  reduced the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders  in childhood cancer survivors , although no evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of no effect . This review highlights the need for further well design ed trials to be implemented in this population."

"SOBJECTIVE  Cementless  total hip arthroplasty  (   THA  ) is associated with reliable clinical results and high patient satisfaction .  Short-stem prostheses ( SS )  were design ed to achieve superior preservation of proximal bone stock and stability compared with those of  conventional-stem prostheses ( CS ) .  This meta- analysis was conducted to determine the  proximal bone remodelling , revision rate , Harris Hip Score , radiolucent line and maximum total point motion values  of both  SS  and  CS  for primary THA . METHOD Relevant r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) involving  SS  and  CS  in primary THA were identified from electronic data bases , such as EMBASE , PubMed and the Cochrane Library . RESULT Ultimately ,  12 RCTs involving 1130 patients ( 1387 hips ) were included .  The results showed that compared with  CS , SS  result ed in less  bone mineral density ( BMD ) changes  in Gruen zone 7 at 1 year and 2 years postoperatively ( mean difference (MD)=5.11 ; 95 % CI , 1.61 , 8.61 ; P=0.30 ; and MD=4.90 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 , 8.79 ; P=0.17 , respectively ) . No difference in  BMD changes  was found for Gruen zone 1 ( MD=2.66 ; 95 % CI , -3.31 , 8.64 ; P<0.00001 ) , and no differences were observed for the  revision rate  ( relative risk (RR)=1.52 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 , 3.26 ; P=0.94 ) ,  Harris Hip Score  ( MD=-0.38 ; 95 % CI , -1.02 , 0.26 ; P=0.89 ) or  stem migration  ( MD=0.02 ; 95 % CI , -0.07 , 0.11 ; P=0.04 ) .  Our results suggest that compared with  CS , SS  may provide superior bone remodelling and similar survival rates and clinical outcomes . However , the short-term follow-up of the included studies was inadequate to determine the long-term performance of SS."
"sPURPOSE To evaluate the reliability and validity of the  six-minute walk test ( 6MWT )  with respect to its ability to predict functional capacity in  patients with chronic heart failure .  METHODS A systematic review was performed via  8 data bases  to assess  relevant English language full-text articles published from January 1 , 1980 to October 31 , 2009 .  Participant characteristics , interventions , reliability , validity , and predictive value for each article with respect to functional capacity as defined by peak VO(2 ) levels were extracted and compared .  Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS ) scores  were determined for each study . RESULTS  Fourteen studies met the selection criteria  . Comparison of the studies investigating  reliability  shows that the  6MWT  has good  reproducibility .  The  6MWT  demonstrates moderate correlation with  peak VO(2 ) levels  , and ability to  predict VO(2 ) ( functional capacity )  dependent on  distance walked . Cut-off distances  vary from 300 to 490 meters depending on the study ; if  total distance walked  remains equal or less than these values , the  6MWT  retains its strong predictive value .  The  6MWT  has good  reliability  , moderate  validity  , and a significant ability to  predict functional capacity  in patients with CHF who do not walk greater than 490 meters."
 The results of this review suggest that an  individual home-based or supervised exercise program  is better than no intervention ; that  supervised group physiotherapy  is better than home exercises  ;  and that combined inpatient spa-exercise therapy followed by group physiotherapy is better than group physiotherapy alone.
"eFollicular  lymphoma ( FL )  is the most common  indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL )  in  North America  . Because of the heterogeneity of the disease , treatment options vary from  observation  to  aggressive therapies  or  stem cell transplantation  , or both . Although advances in treatment have improved outcomes , the disease remains largely incurable . In Canada , no unified national guideline exists for the front-line treatment of FL ; provincial guidelines vary and are largely based on funding . There is therefore a need for evidence -based national treatment guidelines that are supported by Canadian hematologists to ensure that  patients with FL  have equitable access to the best available care . A group of experts from across Canada developed a national  evidence -based treatment guideline  to provide health care professionals with clear guidance on the first-line management of FL . Results of a systematic review of the literature are presented with consensus recommendations based on available evidence."
"sThe aim was to report on the  longevity  of   restorations  placed  using the atraumatic restorative treatment ( ART ) approach   compared with that of   equivalent placed amalgam restorations .   Five data bases were systematic ally search ed for  articles up to 16 March 2009 . Inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) titles/ abstract s relevant to the topic ; ( 2 ) published in English ; ( 3 ) reporting on 2-arm longitudinal in vivo trials ; ( 4 ) minimum follow-up period of 12 months . Exclusion criteria : ( 1 ) insufficient r and om or quasi-r and om allocation of study subjects ; ( 2 ) not all entered subjects accounted for at trial conclusion ; ( 3 ) subjects of both groups not followed up in the same way . Fourteen from the initial search of 164 articles  complied with these criteria and were selected for review . From these , seven were rejected and seven articles reporting on 27 separate data sets , accepted . Only identified homogeneous data sets were combined for meta- analysis . From the 27 separate computable dichotomous data sets , four yielded a statistically significant  improvement of longevity of  ART versus  amalgam  restorations :   posterior class V , 28 % over 6.3 years ; posterior class I , 6 % after 2.3 years and 9 % after 4.3 years ; posterior class II , 61 % after 2.3 years . Studies investigating restorations placed in the primary dentition showed no  significant differences  between the groups after 12 and 24 months . In the permanent dentition , the  longevity  of  ART restorations  is equal to or greater than that of  equivalent amalgam restorations  for up to 6.3 years and is site-dependent . No difference was observed in primary teeth . More trials are needed in order to confirm these results."
"  N-OTC  is associated with  shorter operative time  and  fewer peri-operative complications  , and it is comparable to  R-OTC  in terms of  CBD injury risk  during cholecystectomy .  R-OTC  is helpful for  peri-operative CBD stone detection  and there is therefore reduced  readmission  for retained CBD stones . The  N-OTC  approach may be adopted routinely for  patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy  providing there are no clinical , biochemical or radiological features suggestive of CBD stones . However , a major multicentre r and omised controlled trial is required to vali date this conclusion."
"dAbstract In 2006 , PAIN published a systematic review of the measurement properties of  self-report pain intensity measures   in children and adolescents  ( Stinson JN , Kavanagh T , Yamada J , Gill N , Stevens B. Systematic review of the psychometric properties , interpretability and feasibility of  self-report pain intensity measures  for use in clinical trials in  children and adolescents .  PAIN 2006;125:143–57 ) . Key developments in pediatric pain necessitate an up date of this work , most notably growing use of the 11-point numeric rating scale ( NRS-11 ) . Our aim was to review the measurement properties of  single-item self-report pain intensity measures  in  children 3 to 18 years old .  A secondary aim was to develop evidence -based recommendations for measurement of  child and adolescent  self-report of acute , postoperative , and chronic pain . Method ological quality and sufficiency of measurement properties for reliability , validity , responsiveness , and interpretability was assessed by at least 2 investigators using COnsensus based St and ards for the selection of health  Measurement  INstruments ( COSMIN ) . Search es identified  60 unique self-report measures , of which 8 ( reported in 80 papers ) met inclusion criteria .  Well-established measures included the  NRS-11 , Color Analogue Scale ( CAS ) , Faces Pain Scale – Revised ( FPS-R ; and original FPS ) , Pieces of Hurt , Oucher — Photographic and Numeric scales , Visual Analogue Scale , and Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale ( FACES )  . Quality of studies ranged from poor to excellent and generally reported sufficient criterion and construct validity , and responsiveness , with variable reliability . Content and cross-cultural validity were minimally assessed . Based on available evidence , the NRS-11 , FPS-R , and CAS were strongly recommended for self-report of acute pain . Only weak recommendations could be made for self-report measures for postoperative and chronic pain . No measures were recommended for  children younger than 6 years  , identifying a need for further measurement refinement in this age range . Clinical practice and future research implication s are discussed."
"dUtility is a simple expression of health-related  quality of life  in  individuals with different states of health .  A number of studies on utility measurements were conducted and published in the past . We retrieved  164 English- language articles which appeared in 1966 through 1999  for a systematic review . The number of reports has been increasing at an accelerating pace , especially during the past decade . The most widely used method of utility measurement was   time trade-off   , TTO ( 40 % ) , followed by rating scale , RS ( 31 % ) and st and ard gamble , SG ( 29 % ) . The  utility of chronic health status  was more frequently reported as compared with acute health status ( 907 vs 86 ) . Accordingly , frequently explored clinical categories were cardiology , neurology , nephrology , and gastroenterology . Specifically ,  coronary heart disease  ( 52 utilities ) ,  physical disability due to neurological diseases  ( 45 utilities ) ,  chronic renal failure  ( 74 utilities ) , and  colorectal cancer  ( 29 utilities ) were subject to utility measurement .  Mental or social dysfunctioning  accounted for only a small proportion ( 48 utilities ) . There is a strong tendency for RS to yield the lowest and SG to yield the highest values . We compiled an extensive list of the results of studies on utility as a reference for health care professionals in this field."
">OBJECTIVE This systematic review of recent r and omized trials was conducted to determine if  cardiovascular nursing interventions  improve outcomes in  patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) and /or heart failure .  METHODS R and omized controlled trials of   nursing interventions  in patients with CAD or heart failure published from January 2000 to December 2008  were eligible . Pilot studies and trials with greater than 25 % attrition with no intention-to-treat analyses were excluded . Study characteristics and results were extracted and trials were grade d for method ological quality . RESULTS A total of  2,039 citations from electronic data bases were identified ; 55 articles were eligible for inclusion .  The primary intervention strategy was  education plus behavioral counseling and support  ( 65 % of interventions ) using a combination  of  intervention modes . More than half of the trials ( 57 % ) reported statistically significant results in at least 1 outcome of  blood pressure , lipids , physical activity , dietary intake , cigarette smoking , weight loss , healthcare utilization , mortality , quality of life , and psychosocial outcomes .  However , there were no consistent relationships observed between intervention characteristics and the effects of interventions . The average measure of  study quality  was 2.8 ( possible range , 0 - 4 , with higher score equaling higher quality ) .  Most trials review ed demonstrated a beneficial impact of  nursing interventions  for secondary prevention in  patients with CAD or heart failure .  However , the optimal combination of intervention components , including strategy , mode of delivery , frequency , and duration , remains unknown . Establishing consensus regarding outcome measures , inclusion of adequate , representative sample s , along with cost-effectiveness analyses will promote translation and adoption of cost-effective nursing  interventions ."
">Inflammatory processes are involved in  chronic diseases .  It has been suggested that  melatonin  reduces inflammation by its radical scavenging properties ; however , the results of the previous studies are inconclusive . The objective of the present meta- analysis is to determine the direction and magnitude of  melatonin supplementation  effect on inflammatory biomarkers . Data bases including PubMed , Scopus , Cochran Library , Embase , and Google Scholar were search ed up to April 2019 . Meta- analysis was performed using r and om-effect model . Subgroup analysis , sensitivity analysis , and meta-regression were also carried out .  Thirteen eligible studies with 22 data sets with total sample size of 749 participants were included in the meta- analysis .   Melatonin supplementation  significantly  decreased TNF-α and IL-6 levels  [ ( WMD = − 2.24 pg/ml ; 95 % CI − 3.45 , − 1.03 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 = 96.7 % , Pheterogeneity < 0.001 ) and ( WMD = − 30.25 pg/ml ; 95 % CI − 41.45 , − 19.06 ; P < 0.001 , I2 = 99.0 % ; Pheterogeneity < 0.001 ) ] , respectively .  The effect  of melatonin  on CRP levels  was marginal ( WMD = − 0.45 mg/L ; 95 % CI − 0.94 , 0.03 ; P = 0.06 ; I2 = 96.6 % , Pheterogeneity < 0.001 ) . The results of the present meta- analysis support  that melatonin supplementation  could be  effective on ameliorating of inflammatory mediators ."
" There was moderate evidence to support  cannabinoids  in treating  chronic  , non-cancer pain at 2 weeks . Similar results were observed at later time points , but the confidence in effect is low . There is little evidence that  cannabinoids  increase the risk of  experiencing serious AEs  , although non-serious AEs may be common in the short-term period following use."

"yStudy question Is  methylpheni date  beneficial or harmful for the treatment of  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) in children and adolescents  ? Methods Electronic data bases were search ed up to February 2015 for parallel and crossover r and omised clinical trials comparing  methylpheni date with placebo or no intervention  in  children and adolescents with ADHD .  Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses ( TSA ) were conducted . Quality was assessed using GRADE  .  Teachers , parents , and observers rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour . Study answer and limitations The analyses included  38 parallel group trials ( n=5111 , median treatment duration 49 days ) and 147 crossover trials ( n=7134 , 14 days )  .  The average age across all studies was 9.7 years .  The analysis suggested a beneficial effect of methylpheni date on  teacher rated symptoms  in 19 parallel group trials ( st and ardised mean difference ( SMD ) −0.77 , n=1698 ) , corresponding to a mean difference of −9.6 points on  the  ADHD rating  scale  . There was no evidence that methylpheni date was associated with  an increase in serious adverse events  ( risk ratio 0.98 , nine trials , n=1532 ; TSA adjusted intervention effect RR 0.91 ) . Methylpheni date was associated with  an increased risk of non-serious adverse events  ( 1.29 , 21 trials , n=3132 ; TSA adjusted RR  1.29 ) . Teacher rated general behaviour  seemed to improve with methylpheni date ( SMD −0.87 , five trials , n=668 ) A change of 7 points on  the child health question naire (  CHQ  )  has been deemed a minimal clinical ly relevant difference . The change reported in a meta- analysis of three trials corresponds to a mean difference of 8.0 points on the CHQ ( range 0 - 100 points ) , which suggests that methylpheni date  may improve parent reported quality of life  ( SMD 0.61 , three trials , n=514 ) . 96.8 % of trials were considered high risk of bias trials according to the Cochrane guidelines . All outcomes were assessed very low quality according to GRADE . What this study adds The results suggest that  among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD  , methylpheni date  may improve teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and general behaviour and parent reported quality of life  . However , given the risk of bias in the included studies , and the very low quality of outcomes , the magnitude of the effects is  uncertain  .  Methylpheni  date is associated with an  increased risk of non-serious  but not  serious adverse events .

"sElectronic  diaries  are increasingly used to assess daily pain in many different forms and population s. This systematic review aims to survey the characteristics of studies using  electronic pain diaries  and to examine how these characteristics affect compliance . A literature search of  11 electronic data bases  was conducted . Studies were evaluated on the basis of predetermined inclusion criteria by two independent review ers . Study characteristics were grouped into four categories : general , population ,  electronic diary  , and sampling procedure ( i.e. , response , attrition , and compliance rates ) including strategies to enhance compliance . The  62 included publications reported from 43 different data sets .  Papers were usually written in English and published as from  2000 . Sample s mostly consisted of female chronic pain patients aged 19 - 65 years from western countries .  Most  diaries  held less than 20 items and were completed up to 6 times daily at fixed or prompted times for 1 month at most . Less than 25 % of the studies reported both  response and attrition rates ;  however , a majority reported compliance .  Compliance  was generally high , and positively associated with shorter diaries , age , having a user 's manual , financial compensation and using an alarm . It is important that the various study characteristics are catalogued carefully , especially  response and attrition rates  , because they can affect compliance . Measures of  momentary pain  are often developed for the purpose of a certain study ; st and ardisation and validation of these measures is recommended . Finally , authors should mention whether they report on data that has also been used in previous studies."
"sThe aim of this systematic review was to address the question : Do different   irrigating  protocol  s have an impact on the  dislocation resistance  of  mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)-based material s  ? The review was performed using a well-defined search strategy in three data bases ( PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science ) to include  laboratory studies performed between January 1995 and May 2017  , in accordance with PRISMA guidelines . Two review ers analysed the papers , assessed the risk of bias and extracted data on  teeth used  , sample size ,  size of root canal preparation  , type of  MTA-based  material   , irrigants , canal filling method , storage method and duration , region of roots and the parameters of push-out testing ( slice thickness , plunger dimensions and plunger loading direction ) , the main results and  dislocation resistance  values ( in MPa ) .  From 255 studies , 27 were included for full-text analysis .  Eight papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review . There was a wide variation in  dislocation resistance  due to differences in irrigation sequence , time and concentration of irrigants , storage method and duration , and the parameters of push-out bond strength testing . A meta- analysis was not done but qualitative synthesis of the included studies was performed . No definitive conclusion could be drawn to evaluate the effect of  irrigation protocol  s on  dislocation resistance  of MTA-based material s. Recommendations have been provided for st and ardized testing methods and reporting of future studies , so as to obtain clinical ly relevant information and to underst and the effects of  irrigating protocol s  on root canal sealers and their interactions with the dentine walls of root canals."

"sA systematic review of literature was conducted to examine the association between changes in health-related fitness ( e.g. aerobic capacity and muscular strength /endurance ) and chronic disease risk factors in  overweight and /or obese youth .  Studies published from  2000 - 2010  were included if the  physical activity intervention  was a r and omized controlled trial and reported changes in  fitness  and  health  outcomes by direction and significance ( p < 0.05 ) of the effect .  Aerobic capacity  improved in 91 % and  muscular fitness  improved in 82 % of measures reported . Nearly all studies ( 32 of 33 ) reported improvement in at least one  fitness test  .  Changes in outcomes related to adiposity , cardiovascular , musculoskeletal , metabolic , and mental/emotional health  improved in 60 % , 32 % , 53 % , 41 % , and 33 % of comparisons studied , respectively . In conclusion ,  overweight and obese youth  can improve  physical fitness  across a variety of test measures . When fitness improves ,  beneficial health effects  are observed in some , but not all chronic disease risk factors."

"yBACKGROUND  Growth hormone  is widely abused by  athletes  , frequently with and rogenic steroids . Its effects on  performance  are unclear . OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of  growth hormone  alone or with  testosterone  on  body composition and measures of performance .  DESIGN R and omized ,  placebo-controlled  , blinded study of 8 weeks of treatment followed by a 6-week washout period . R and omization was computer-generated with concealed allocation . ( Australian-New Zeal and Clinical Trials Registry registration number : ACTRN012605000508673 ) SETTING Clinical research facility in  Sydney , Australia .  PARTICIPANTS  96 recreationally trained athletes ( 63 men and 33 women ) with a mean age of 27.9 years ( SD , 5.7 ) .  INTERVENTION  Men  were r and omly assigned to receive  placebo , growth hormone  ( 2 mg/d subcutaneously ) ,  testosterone  ( 250 mg/wk intramuscularly ) , or  combined treatments .   Women  were r and omly assigned to receive either  placebo or growth hormone  ( 2 mg/d ) . MEASUREMENTS  Body composition variables ( fat mass , lean body mass , extracellular water mass , and body cell mass ) and physical performance variables ( endurance [ maximum oxygen consumption ] , strength [ dead lift ] , power [ jump height ] , and sprint capacity [ Wingate value ] )  . RESULTS  Body cell mass  was correlated with all measures of performance at baseline .  Growth  hormone significantly  reduced fat mass , increased lean body mass  through an  increase in extracellular water  , and  increased body cell mass  in men when coadministered with  testosterone  . Growth hormone significantly increased  sprint capacity  , by 0.71 kJ ( 95 % CI , 0.1 to 1.3 kJ ; relative increase , 3.9 % [ CI , 0.0 % to 7.7 % ] ) in men and women combined and by 1.7 kJ ( CI , 0.5 to 3.0 kJ ; relative increase , 8.3 % [ CI , 3.0 % to 13.6 % ] ) when coadministered with testosterone to men ; other  performance  measures did not significantly change . The increase  in sprint capacity  was not maintained 6 weeks after discontinuation of the drug . LIMITATIONS  Growth  hormone dosage may have been lower than that used covertly by competitive athletes . The athletic significance of the observed improvements in  sprint capacity  is unclear , and the study was too small to draw conclusions about safety .   Growth hormone  supplementation influenced  body composition  and increased  sprint capacity  when administered alone and in combination with  testosterone  .

"nOats are a rich source of β-glucan , a viscous , soluble fibre recognised for its cholesterol-lowering properties , and are associated with reduced risk of CVD . Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised-controlled trials ( RCT ) investigating the cholesterol-lowering potential of  oat β-glucan  on LDL-cholesterol , non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB for the risk reduction of CVD . MEDLINE , Embase , CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL were search ed . We included  RCT of ≥3 weeks of follow-up  , assessing the effect of  diets enriched with oat β-glucan  compared with  controlled  diets on LDL-cholesterol , non-HDL-cholesterol or apoB. Two independent review ers extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias . Data were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method with r and om effects models and expressed as mean differences with 95 % CI . Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran 's Q statistic and quantified by the I 2-statistic .  In total , fifty-eight trials ( n 3974 ) were included .  A median dose of 3·5 g/d  of oat β-glucan   significantly lowered LDL-cholesterol  ( -0·19 ; 95 % CI -0·23 , -0·14 mmol/l ,  P<0·00001 ) , non-HDL-cholesterol  ( -0·20 ; 95 % CI -0·26 , -0·15 mmol/l , P<0·00001 )  and apoB  ( -0·03 ; 95 % CI -0·05 , -0·02 g/l , P<0·0001 ) compared with control interventions . There was evidence for considerable unexplained heterogeneity in the  analysis of LDL-cholesterol  ( I 2=79 % )  and non-HDL-cholesterol  ( I 2=99 % ) . Pooled analyses showed  that oat β-glucan  has a  lowering effect on LDL-cholesterol , non-HDL-cholesterol and apoB.  Inclusion  of oat-containing  foods may be a strategy for achieving targets in CVD reduction."
"eChronic  anterior glenohumeral joint instability  is a common situation and can lead to progressive  cartilage deterioration  and ultimately  instability arthopathy .  Progressive cartilage deterioration can occur despite conservative or surgical treatment and the sequelae of these conditions are often addressed with  total shoulder arthroplasty .  Aims of the present study were to analyze the available literature to describe the technical aspects of this particular operation and to report outcomes and complication rates . The hypothesis was that shoulder arthropalsty in the sequelae of instability had lower outcomes and higher complication rates than arthroplasties for primary arthritis . A systematic review of the literature was performed , in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines . PubMed , Ovid , Cochrane Review s , and Google Scholar were comprehensively search ed using a combination of the following keywords :  shoulder arthroplasty  ,  reverse shoulder arthroplasty  , dislocation arthropathy , capsulorrhaphy arthropathy and stabilization procedures .  Thirteen studies with 365 patients met inclusion criteria .  Since 13 patients were lost to follow-up  , 352 were review ed at an average follow-up of 53.4 months .  The  average Constant – Murley ( CM ) and American Shoulder and Elbow Society ( ASES ) scores  improved from 35.6 and 35.7 to 72.7 and 77 , respectively . The  overall complication rate  was 25.7 % and the  reoperation rate  was 18.5 % . Radiographs at follow-up revealed  radiolucent lines on the humerus  in 12.4 % of cases and  radiolucent lines or notching  on the glenoid side in 22.7 % of cases . The  average Method ological Index  for  Non-r  and omized Studies  Score  ( MINORS ) was 12.9 for non-comparative studies and 21.3 for comparative studies . Shoulder arthroplasty to address the sequelae of instability arthropathy and stabilization procedures can be a challenging procedure as a consequence of the distorted anatomy and severe glenohumeral joint pathology .  Complication and reoperation rates  are higher compared to shoulder arthroplasty for primary glenohumeral joint arthritis ; however , the difference is not statistically significant . When  reverse shoulder arthroplasties  ( RSA ) were considered as a subgroup and compared to  anatomic shoulder replacements ( total shoulders  and  hemiarthroplasties  ) , they showed a lower revision rate."
"aThe role of  metronidazole alone , percutaneous aspiration ( PA ) , and percutaneous catheter drainage ( PCD )  in the treatment of  uncomplicated amebic liver abscess ( ALA )  is still unclear . This systematic review and meta- analysis evaluated the available evidence s with regard to treatment modalities in such patients . The data base was search ed for relevant r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) published until May 2019 . All studies were assessed for risk of bias . The relevant data were pooled in a r and om or fixed-effect model to calculate the mean difference ( MD ) or relative risks . After the detailed screening ,  570 patients from 10 RCTs comparing  metronidazole alone  with  metronidazole + PA  were included  . Most studies had uncertain risk of biases .  Days to resolution of abdominal pain  ( MD − 1.59 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] − 2.77 , − 0.42 , I2 = 89 % )  and tenderness  ( MD − 1.76 , 95 % CI − 2.93 , − 0.58 , I2 = 72 % ) were significantly shorter in the  metronidazole + PA  group . There was no significant difference in relation to  the resolution of fever , abscess size , and hospital stay .  The  beneficial effects  of PA were seen with medium-to-large ( > 5 cm ) ALA and not with small ( < 5 cm ) ALA . Addition of   PCD  to  metronidazole  therapy  was better than metronidazole alone in one low- quality RCT . Two RCTs  found PCD  to be better than PA for large ALA .  Percutaneous aspiration  as compared with metronidazole alone results in the  early resolution of pain and tenderness  in patients with medium-to-large ALA . Percutaneous  catheter  drainage is better for larger ALA . However , discrepancies in RCTs create therapeutic dilemmas necessitating further efforts to generate more reliable data."

"nThe aim of this systematic review is to assess whether  metformin  could change the  concentration of serum homocysteine ( Hcy )  with and without simultaneous supplementation of  B-group vitamins  or  folic acid  . A literature search was conducted in PubMed , EmBase , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) to identify r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) reporting the concentration of  serum Hcy in metformin-treated adults .  Meta- analysis was applied to assess the association between  metformin  and the changes  of Hcy concentration .   Twelve publications were included in this study  . In the overall analysis ,  metformin  administration was not statistically associated with the  change of Hcy  when compared with  the control treatment  ( mean difference ( MD ) , 0.40 μmol/L ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , −0.07~0.87 μmol/L , p = 0.10 ) . In the subgroup analysis  , metformin  was significantly associated with an  increased concentration of Hcy  in the absence of exogenous supplementation of folic acid or B-group vitamins ( MD , 2.02 μmol/L ; 95 % CI , 1.37~2.67 μmol/L , p < 0.00001 ) , but with a  decreased concentration of serum Hcy  in the presence of these exogenous supplementations ( MD , −0.74 μmol/L ; 95 % CI , −1.19~−0.30 μmol/L , p = 0.001 ) . Therefore , although the overall effect  of metformin  on  the concentration of serum Hcy  was neutral , our results suggested  that metformin  could  increase the concentration of Hcy  when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given."
" The economics of preventing diabetes are complex . There is some evidence that diabetes prevention programmes  are cost effective  , but the evidence base to date provides few clear answers regarding design of prevention programmes because of differences in denominator population s , definitions , interventions and modelling assumptions."
"aOBJECTIVES Generic health status measures such as the short form  health  survey ( SF-36 ) and  EuroQol-5D  ( EQ-5D ) are increasingly being used to inform health policy . They are cl aim ed to be applicable across disease areas and have started to be used within mental health research . This review aims to assess the construct validity and responsiveness of four generic health status measures in  schizophrenia  , including the  preference-based SF-6D and EQ-5D .  METHOD A systematic review of the literature was undertaken .  Ten data bases were search ed from inception to August 2009  and reference lists scrutinized to identify relevant studies . Studies were appraised and data extracted . A narrative synthesis was performed of the evidence on construct validity including known groups validity ( detecting a difference in  health-related quality of life (  HRQL  )  scores between two different groups such as sample s from the general population and people with schizophrenia ) , convergent validity ( strength of association between generic  HRQL  and other measures ( e.g. , symptom or functional ) , and responsiveness . Responsiveness was considered by : 1 ) differences in  generic HRQL measure scores  in responders/non-responders and 2 ) correlation between changes on generic  HRQL  measures and changes in specific measures obtained from patients and clinicians . RESULTS Thirty-three studies were identified that provided data on the  validity  and /or responsiveness of the instruments . Most of the evidence concerns the SF-36 and EQ-5D , and for these instruments there was evidence for known  group validity .  The evidence for  convergent validity and responsiveness  was mixed , with studies presenting contradictory results .  Although the evidence base is limited in a number of important respects , including problems with the measures used to develop constructs in the validation studies , it is sufficient to raise doubts about the use of generic measures of health like the EQ-5D and SF-36 in patients with schizophrenia."
"lBACKGROUND The  treatment  and  prevention  of   hypertrophic scars  and  keloids   represents a special challenge particularly in plastic surgery . Given their simple , non-invasive and painless application ,  topical preparations  are an attractive therapeutic option . On the part of the patients , the  efficacy  in  prevention  of and  therapy  for  hypertrophic scars and keloids  of these topical preparations is regularly question ed . The clarification of this issue is subject of this review . MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic literature research on the data bases Medline , Medline Plus , Old medline and Cochrane Library was conducted . All r and omised controlled trials , meta-analyses , systematic review s , case series and case studies from the  German and English literature  , dealing with  topical preparations approved in the German speaking area  , were included . RESULTS In this research , 14 topical preparations were identified . However , there is limited data regarding their efficacy as compared to each other , to other treatment options or untreated controls . Only for 6 topical preparations studies with high evidence level exist . Contractubex showed best results in the prevention  of pathological scars .   Even though Contractubex shows preventive effects and can be recommended based on current data , further studies are needed to strengthen the body of evidence and to prove the therapeutic efficacy of topical preparations in general."
"dOBJECTIVES To systematic ally review the measurement properties of  performance-based measures  to assess physical function in  people with hip and /or knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) .  METHODS Electronic search es were performed in MEDLINE , CINAHL , Embase , and PsycINFO up to the end of June 2012 . Two review ers independently rated measurement properties using the consensus-based st and ards for the selection of  health status measurement instrument ( COSMIN )  . "" Best evidence synthesis "" was made using COSMIN outcomes and the quality of findings . RESULTS  Twenty-four out of 1792 publications were eligible for inclusion .  Twenty-one   performance-based measures   were evaluated including 15   single-activity measures   and six   multi-activity measures .   Measurement properties evaluated included  internal consistency  ( three  measures ) , reliability ( 16 measures ) , measurement error  (  14 measures ) , validity  ( nine  measures ) , responsiveness  ( 12  measures  )  and interpretability  ( three measures ) . A positive rating was given to only 16 % of possible measurement ratings . Evidence for the majority of measurement properties of tests reported in the review has yet to be determined . On balance of the limited evidence , the  40 m self-paced test  was the best rated  walk test  , the  30 s-chair  st  and test and timed  up  and go test  were the best rated  sit to st and tests  , and the  Stratford battery , Physical Activity Restrictions and Functional Assessment System  were the best rated multi-activity measures .  Further good quality research investigating measurement properties of performance measures , including responsiveness and interpretability in  people with hip and  /or knee OA , is needed . Consensus on which combination of measures will best assess  physical function  in  people with hip/  and or knee OA is urgently required."
"nPhysical  fitness ( PF )  is a construct of health- and skill-related attributes which have been associated with academic performance ( AP ) in  youth .  This study aim ed to review the scientific evidence on the association among components of  PF and AP   in children and adolescents .  A systematic review of articles using data bases PubMed / Medline , ERIC , LILACS , SciELO , and Web of Science was undertaken .  Cross-sectional  and longitudinal  studies  examining the  association between at least one component of  PF and AP  in children and adolescents , published between 1990 and June 2016  , were included . Independent extraction of articles was carried out by the two authors using predefined data fields .  From a total of 45 studies included ,  25 report a positive association between components of  PF  with  AP  and 20 describe a single association between   cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF )   and  AP  . According to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines : 12 were classified as low , 32 as medium risk , and 1 as high risk of bias . Thirty-one studies reported a  positive association between AP and CRF  , six studies  with muscular strength  , three studies  with flexibility  , and seven studies reported a positive  association  between  clustered of PF components and AP  . The magnitude of the associations is weak to moderate ( β = 0.10 - 0.42 and odds = 1.01 - 4.14 ) . There is strong evidence for a  positive association between CRF and cluster of PF with AP  in cross-sectional studies ; and evidence from longitudinal studies for a positive association between cluster of PF and AP ; the relationship between  muscular  strength and flexibility  with  AP remains uncertain."
" Evidence for the effectiveness of SGAs is limited to one small trial of  fluoxetine  compared with  placebo  , which shows a non-significant effect in favour of  fluoxetine  , and two small trials comparing  fluoxetine  against  light therapy  , which suggest equivalence between the two interventions . The lack of available evidence precludes the ability to draw any overall conclusions on the use of SGAs for SAD . Further larger RCTs are required to exp and and strengthen the evidence base on this topic , and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other SGAs . Data on  adverse events  were sparse , and a comparative analysis was not possible . Therefore the data we obtained on  adverse effects  is not robust and our confidence in the data is limited . Overall , up to 27 % of participants treated with SGAs for SAD withdrew from the studies early due to  adverse effects .  The overall quality of evidence in this review is very low."
"CThe requirements for an ideal restorative material include adhesion to tooth structure ( enamel and dentine ) and an ability to withst and the traumas of occlusion . However , some level of an anticaries effect is also desirable . After a long history of  glass-ionomer cement ( GIC )  development , an evidence base in support of the therapeutic effect of GIC , particularly with regard to its anticaries effect , is emerging . This evidence is increasingly presented through systematic review s of clinical GIC application and , to a certain extent , relates to a caries-preventive effect of the material itself . However , the strength of evidence supporting other aspects of GIC , such as a  higher remineralizing effect , fluoride uptake in hard tooth tissue and fluoride release of GIC  , is limited . Nevertheless , the results of these in situ and laboratory trials provide valuable insights into factors that facilitate underst and ing of the clinical efficacy of GIC."

"eBACKGROUND  Task sharing  for the management of hypertension could be useful for understaffed and re source -poor health systems . We assessed the effectiveness of  task-sharing interventions  in improving  blood pressure control  among  adults in low-income and middle-income countries .  METHODS We search ed the Cochrane Library , PubMed , Embase , and CINAHL for studies published up to December 2018 . We included intervention studies involving a  task-sharing strategy  for management of blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors . We extracted data on population , interventions , blood pressure , and task sharing groups . We did a meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials . FINDINGS We found  3012 references ,  of which  54 met the  inclusion  criteria  initially . Another nine studies were included following an up date d search . There were 43 trials and 20 before- and -after studies . We included 31 studies in our  meta- analysis . Systolic blood pressure  was decreased  through task sharing  in different groups  of health-care workers :  the mean difference was -5·34 mm Hg ( 95 % CI -9·00 to -1·67 , I2=84 % )  for  task sharing with nurses , -8·12 mm Hg ( -10·23 to -6·01 , I2=57 % ) for pharmacists , -4·67 mm Hg ( -7·09 to -2·24 , I2=0 % ) for dietitians , -3·67 mm Hg ( -4·58 to -2·77 , I2=24 % ) for community health workers , and -4·85 mm Hg ( -6·12 to -3·57 , I2=76 % ) overall . We found a similar  reduction in diastolic blood pressure  ( overall mean difference -2·92 mm Hg , -3·75 to -2·09 , I2=80 % ) .  The overall quality of evidence based on GRADE criteria was moderate for systolic blood pressure  ,  but low for diastolic blood pressure  .  INTERPRETATION Task-sharing interventions  are  effective in reducing blood pressure  . Long-term studies are needed to underst and their potential impact on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality .

"tBACKGROUND Oxidative stress is prevalent in  dialysis patients  and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and anaemia . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to examine the effect of  Excebrane , a vitamin E-coated cellulose-based dialyser  , on circulating biomarkers of lipid peroxidation , as surrogate markers of oxidative stress . METHODS The primary sources used to identify c and i date studies included PubMed , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , a bibliography provided by the dialyser manufacturer , and a manual search of abstract s from proceedings of scientific meetings and review articles . Studies were selected for analysis if their design included a comparator group ( primarily within patient comparison , i.e. pre- and post- study evaluations ) . For the meta- analysis , we computed the overall change of the outcome from baseline using a r and om-effects model . A supplemental analysis was performed in which the absolute levels of these biomarkers of lipid peroxidation were converted to a common unit by calculating st and ardized effect sizes . RESULTS  Fourteen peer- review ed articles  met the criteria . The  studies consisted  of  11 single arm , one r and omized crossover and two r and omized controlled trials , with a total of 37 to 158 evaluable patients , according to the outcome of interest analysed  . Due to the paucity of r and omized trials , the meta- analysis was limited to the Excebrane arm of each study . When the studies were combined according to similar measurement units , the overall mean decrease in  malondialdehyde ( MDA ) level  was -0.3 mM ( 95 % CI , -0.5 to -0.1 mM ; seven studies ) and -0.8 nmol/mg low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) ( 95 % CI , -1.3 to -0.4 nmol/mg LDL ; three studies ) , respectively . The summary estimate revealed a non-significant decrease in  pre-dialysis thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) level  of 0.4 microM ( 95 % CI , -1.2 to 0.4 microM ; three studies ) . When the  MDA and TBARS  studies were combined using the st and ardized effect size , the mean decrease in  these biomarkers of lipid peroxidation  was statistically significant at -1.7 units ( 95 % CI , -2.7 , -0.7 units ; 13 studies ) . A meta- analysis on the effect of Excebrane on pre-dialysis levels of  oxidized-LDL  could not be performed due to study heterogeneity .  The conversion of dialysis patients to a  vitamin E-coated dialyser  is associated with an improvement in circulating  biomarkers of lipid peroxidation  , which is of potential clinical benefit."
"aThe aim of this work was to identify the limitations of previously published systematic review s evaluating the  outcome  of    root canal treatment .    Traditionally ,  periapical radiography  has been used to assess the outcome of root  canal treatment  with the absence of a periapical radiolucency being considered a confirmation of a healthy periapex . However , a high percentage of cases confirmed as healthy by radiographs revealed apical periodontitis on cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) and by histology . In teeth , where reduced size of the existing radiolucency was diagnosed by  radiographs  and considered to represent periapical healing , enlargement of the lesion was frequently confirmed by  CBCT .  In clinical studies , two additional factors may have further contributed to the overestimation of successful outcomes after  root canal treatment  : ( i ) extraction s and re-treatments were rarely recorded as failures ; and ( ii ) the recall rate was often lower than 50 % . The   periapical index  ( PAI )  , frequently used for determination of success , was based on radiographic and histological findings in the  periapical region  of  maxillary incisors .  The validity of using PAI for all tooth positions might be question able , as the  thickness of the cortical bone and the position of the root tip in relation with the  cortex vary with tooth position . In conclusion , the serious limitations of longitudinal clinical studies restrict the correct interpretation of  root canal treatment outcomes .  Systematic review s reporting the  success rates  of  root canal treatment  without referring to these limitations may mislead readers . The  outcomes of  root canal treatment   should be re-evaluated in long-term longitudinal studies using CBCT and stricter evaluation criteria."
"eINTRODUCTION Unexplained differences between classes of  antihypertensive drugs  in their effectiveness in preventing stroke might be due to class effects on intraindividual variability in blood pressure  .  We did a systematic review to assess any such effects in r and omised controlled trials . METHODS Baseline and follow-up data for  mean ( SD )  of  systolic blood pressure ( SBP )  were extracted from trial reports . Effect of treatment on  interindividual variance ( SD2 ) in blood pressure  ( a surrogate for within-individual variability ) , expressed as the ratio of the variances ( VR ) , was related to effects on clinical outcomes . Pooled estimates were derived by use of r and om-effects meta- analysis . FINDINGS  Mean ( SD ) SBP at follow-up  was reported in  389 ( 28 % ) of 1372 eligible trials .  There was substantial heterogeneity between trials in VR ( p<1 x 10(-40 ) ) , 68 % of which was attributable to allocated drug class . Compared with other drugs ,  interindividual variation in SBP  was reduced by  calcium-channel blockers  ( VR 0.81 , 95 % CI 0.76 - 0.86 , p<0.0001 ) and  non-loop diuretic drugs  ( 0.87 , 0.79 - 0.96 , p=0.007 ) , and increased by  angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors  ( 1.08 , 1.02 - 1.15 , p=0.008 ) ,  angiotensin-receptor blockers  ( 1.16 , 1.07 - 1.25 , p=0.0002 ) , and  beta blockers  ( 1.17 , 1.07 - 1.28 , p=0.0007 ) . Compared with  placebo  only ,  interindividual variation in SBP  was reduced the most by  calcium-channel blockers  ( 0.76 , 0.67 - 0.85 , p<0.0001 ) . Effects were consistent in parallel group and crossover design trials , and in analyses of dose-response . Across all trials , effects of treatment on  VR of SBP  ( r2=0.372 , p=0.0006 ) and on  mean SBP  ( r2=0.328 , p=0.0015 ) accounted for effects on  stroke risk  ( eg , odds ratio 0.79 , 0.71 - 0.87 , p<0.0001 , for VR < or = 0.80 ) , and both remained significant in a combined model . INTERPRETATION Drug-class effects on interindividual variation in  blood pressure  can account for differences in effects of antihypertensive drugs on risk of stroke independently of effects on mean  SBP .  FUNDING None."
"ySeveral theories have been proposed to explain the 3- to 6-fold gender difference in the incidence of  anterior cruciate ligament injuries .  One potential theory for the increased incidence is based on gender-related hormonal differences between men and women , especially after puberty and the onset of menses in the female athlete . The purpose of this systematic review was to compile and systematic ally analyze the published literature to determine if the menstrual cycle is associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury risk and to provide an objective comparison of the published results . Investigations were included in the systematic review if the report included associations between the menstrual cycle and noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injuries in  female athletes .  Abstract s and unpublished studies were excluded .  Seven articles were identified that  met the systematic review inclusion criteria . The 7 review ed studies favored an effect of the first half , or preovulatory phase , of the menstrual cycle for  increased anterior cruciate ligament injuries .  The 6 studies that separated the non — oral contraceptive and oral contraceptive data also favored an effect of the first half of the menstrual cycle for  increased anterior cruciate ligament injuries .  The clinical relevance of this finding is that  female athletes  may be more predisposed to  anterior cruciate ligament injuries  during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle . These findings may lead to potential interventions targeted toward this phase of the menstrual cycle to reduce the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury."
"tBackground Health  state utility values  ( HSUVs ) are required to calculate  quality -adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) .  They are frequently derived from generic preference-based measures of health . However , such generic measures may not capture health attributes of relevance to specific conditions . In such cases , a  condition-specific preference-based measure (  CSPBM  )  may be more appropriate . Objective This systematic review aim ed to identify all published accounts of developing  CSPBMs  to describe and appraise the methods used . Method We undertook a systematic search ( of Embase , MEDLINE , PsycINFO , Web of Science , the Cochrane Library , CINAHL , EconLit , ASSIA  and the  Health Management Information  Consortium data base )  to identify  published accounts of CSPBM development up to July 2015 .  Studies were review ed to investigate the methods used to design  classification systems  , estimate  HSUVs  , and vali date the measures . Results A total of  86 publications were identified , describing 51 CSPBMs .  Around two-thirds of these were  QALY measures ;  the remainder were design ed for clinical decision making only . Classification systems for 33  CSPBMs  were derived from existing instruments ; 18 were developed de novo . HSUVs for 34 instruments were estimated using a ‘ composite ’ approach , involving statistical modelling ; the remainder used a ‘ decomposed ’ approach based on multi-attribute utility theory . Half of the papers that described the estimation of  HSUVs  did not report validating their measures . Conclusion Various methods have been used at all stages of CSPBM development . The choice between developing a classification system de novo or from an existing instrument may depend on the availability of a suitable existing measure , while the choice between a decomposed or composite approach appears to be determined primarily by the purpose for which the instrument is design ed . The validation of CSPBMs remains an area for further development."
"nBackground  Cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT )  is beneficial in  selected patients with heart failure ( HF ) in normal sinus rhythm ( NSR ) .  We sought to evaluate the impact of  CRT with or without atrioventricular junction ( AVJ ) ablation  in  patients with HF with concomitant atrial fibrillation ( AF )  Methods and results Literature was search ed ( inception through 30 August 2017 ) for observational studies that reported outcomes in  patients with HF with CRT and AF that reported  all-cause and cardiovascular mortality  . Thirty-one studies with 83 , 571 patients were included .   CRT  did not decrease  mortality  compared with  internal cardioverter defibrillator or medical therapy alone  in  patients with HF and AF with indications for CRT  ( OR : 0.851 , 95 % CI 0.616 to 1.176 , p=0.328 , I2=86.954 ) . CRT-AF patients had significantly  higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality  than CRT-NSR patients ( [ OR : 1.472 , 95 % CI 1.301 to 1.664 , p=0.000 ] and [ OR : 1.857 , 95 % CI 1.350 to 2.554 , p=0.000 ] respectively ) .  Change in left ventricular ejection fraction  was not different between CRT patients with and without AF ( p=0.705 ) . AVJ ablation , however , improved  all-cause mortality  in CRT-AF patients when compared with CRT-AF patients without AVJ ablation ( OR : 0.485 , 95 % CI 0.247 to 0.952 , p=0.035 ) . With AVJ ablation , there was no difference in  all-cause mortality  in CRT-AF patients compared with CRT-NSR patients ( OR : 1.245 , 95 % CI 0.914 to 1.696 , p=0.165 ) . Conclusion The results of our meta- analysis suggest that AF was associated with decreased CRT benefits in  patients with HF  . CRT , however , benefits patients with AF with AVJ ablation."

"sAlthough  physical activity  performed after  bariatric surgery  is associated with enhanced  weight loss  outcomes , there is limited information on patients ' physical activity behaviour in this context . This systematic review and meta- analysis assessed pre-operative to post-operative changes in  physical activity and physical function outcomes  among  obese adults undergoing  bariatric surgery .  A total of 50 studies met inclusion criteria with 26 papers  reporting data for meta- analysis . Increases in both  objective ly recorded and self-reported physical activity  at 12 months were demonstrated . Studies indicated that there was a shift towards a greater amount of  active time  , but of a lower intensity within the first 6 months of bariatric surgery , suggested by a reduction in  moderate to vigorous physical activity  but an increase in  step count .  A st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) of 1.53 ( 95 % CI : 1.02 - 2.04 ) based on nine studies indicated  improved walking performance  at 12 months . Similarly , analysis of five studies demonstrated  increased musculoskeletal function  at 3 - 6 months ( SMD : 1.51 ; 95 % CI : 0.60 - 2.42 ) . No relationship was identified between  changes in weight and walking performance  post-surgery . More studies assessing  physical activity , physical function and weight loss  would help underst and the role of  physical activity  in optimizing post-operative weight and functional outcomes."
"sOBJECTIVE To systematic ally review the literature on the  metabolic costs  of activities of daily living (  ADL  ) in  persons with a lower limb amputation ( LLA ) .  DATA SOURCES A literature search was undertaken in the Pubmed , Embase , CINAHL , CENTRAL , and PsycINFO data bases using keywords and synonyms for LLA , metabolic costs , and ADL . The last search was performed on November 29th , 2017 . STUDY SELECTION Studies were included if they met the following  2 criteria : participants were adults with a ( unilateral or bilateral ) LLA  and  metabolic costs  were measured while participants performed a  physical activity  or  ADL  . DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data of  1,912 participants from 61 studies  were included in the systematic review and meta- analysis . The studies used different terms to describe  metabolic costs .   Participants were recruited in different setting s , relatively healthy , with few comorbidities .  Limited data were available on  metabolic costs  of other activities than  walking with a prosthesis .  A linear mixed model analysis was performed based on the means reported , with study as unit of analysis and test results of different groups and measurement conditions as repeated measures within the unit of analysis . Predictors entered in the analysis were e.g.  level and reason of amputation , age , weight , and height .  During walking ,  oxygen consumption  ( ml O2/kg/min ) and  heart rate  ( beats/min ) increased with a higher walking speed and a more proximal amputation . Additionally ,  oxygen consumption  was determined by the interaction terms  walking speed  x  amputation level  and  walking speed squared  .  Heart rate  was determined by the interaction term walking speed squared .  During walking ,  oxygen consumption  ( ml O2/kg/min ) and  heart rate  ( beats/min ) increased with a higher walking speed and a more proximal amputation . Data on  metabolic costs  of other activities were limited . The poor quality of the studies and the  relatively healthy participants  limited generalizability of the results of the meta- analysis."
"dBackground This systematic review aim ed to assess the clinical effects of  laser preparation  compared to other types of  chemical or mechanical preparation  of  tooth surfaces  used in  fissure sealant placement .  Methods A systematic literature search was conducted up to January 2019 , through Pubmed , Scopus , Medline / EMBASE via OVID and the Cochrane library . Only r and omized clinical trials were included . Results  Five studies were included in the systematic review  and three were included in the meta- analysis . All the studies used  acid-etching  as a comparator to  lasers .  All the included studies were rated as having an overall high risk of bias introduced by performance bias . Three studies assessed the clinical effects of fissure sealants placed by  acid or laser etching  , one compared  acid etching versus laser combined with acid etching  and one investigated the influence of  lasers  on the objective and subjective parameters of stress during sealant application in  children .  The meta- analysis showed no significant difference between  laser preparation  and  conventional acid-etching preparation  at 3- ( P = 0.08 ) , 6- ( P = 0.49 ) , and 12-month ( P = 0.87 ) follow-ups . One study reported that  laser preparation  as an adjunct to  acid-etching  enhanced the  retention rate .  No significant difference in the  incidence of caries  was reported . And no significant differences were found in  heart rates , oxygen saturation or degree of the patient dental anxiety  between  acid-etching  and  laser preparation .  Conclusion The present limited evidence suggests that  lasers  could be an effective pretreatment method . The  retention rate  was similar to that of conventional  acid etching .  However , the included studies had an overall high risk of bias and more rigorously design ed research is needed."

"  Reserpine  is effective in reducing  SBP  roughly to the same degree as other first-line antihypertensive drugs . However , we could not make definite conclusions regarding the dose-response pattern because of the small number of included trials . More RCTs are needed to assess the effects of  reserpine  on  blood pressure  and to determine the dose-related safety profile before the role of this drug in the treatment of primary hypertension can be established."

"yOBJECTIVE To give an overview of factors related to the  level of  physical activity   in  patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) .  METHODS An extensive systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed , CINAHL and Embase . Inclusion criteria were :  studies on patients with a diagnosis of OA of hip and /or knee , studies describing factors related  to physical activity  ( objective or subjective ) , full length articles that were published in Dutch , German or English language .  Two review ers independently assessed the method ological quality . A best- evidence synthesis was performed for factors which were investigated in two or more studies . RESULTS  Eight studies were included  ,  all with a cross-sectional design ( five high quality and three low quality studies  ) , result ing in , at most , limited evidence in the best- evidence synthesis . For  patients with knee OA  there is limited evidence that a  lower level of physical function  is associated with a  lower level of physical activity .  There is also limited evidence that  depression  is not associated with the  level of physical activity .  For  patients with hip OA  there is limited evidence that higher age , higher  body mass index  ( BMI ) and a low  level of physical function  is associated with a  low level of physical activity .   A high age ( hip OA ) , a high BMI ( hip OA ) and a low level of physical function ( both hip and knee OA ) are related to a  low level of  physical activity  .  However , the level of evidence was only limited . Before new strategies and interventions to  increase  physical activity   in  patients with OA  can be developed , high quality longitudinal studies are needed to get more insight in the causality between factors and low levels of physical activity."
" No RCTs were located that assessed the effects of preconception  advice  on the  chance of a live birth  or  other fertility outcomes  in  people who perceived that they may be infertile  and were investigating the possibility of medical treatment to address   subfertility  .  Given the lack of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of preconception lifestyle advice for  people  in the afore-mentioned population , this review can not provide guidance for clinical practice in this area . However , it does highlight the need for further research into this important subject."

">Background The expectation that training enhances performance is well explored in professional sport . However , the additional challenges of physical and cognitive maturation may require careful consideration when determining workloads to enhance performance in  adolescents .  Objective The objective of this study was to determine the state of knowledge on the relationship between workloads , physical performance , injury and /or illness in  adolescent male football players .  Methods A systematic review of workloads , physical performance , injury and illness in  male adolescent football players  was conducted . Studies for this review were identified through a systematic search of six electronic data bases ( Academic Search Complete , CINAHL , PsycINFO , PubMed , SPORTD iscus , and Web of Science ) . For the purpose of this review , load was defined as the cumulative amount of stress placed on an individual from multiple  training sessions  and games over a period of time , expressed in terms of either the external workloads performed ( e.g. , resistance lifted , kilometres run ) or the internal response ( e.g. , heart rate , rating of perceived exertion ) to that workload . Results  A total of 2,081 studies were initially retrieved from the six data bases , of which 892 were duplicates .  After screening the titles , abstract s and full texts , we identified  23 articles meeting our criteria around adolescent football players ,  workloads , physical performance , injury and /or illness . Seventeen articles addressed the relationship between load and  physical performance  , four articles addressed the relationship between  load and injury  and two articles addressed both . A wide range of training modalities were employed to improve the  physical performance  of  adolescent football players  , with  strength training , high-intensity interval training , dribbling and small-sided games training  , and a combination of these modalities in addition to  normal football training  , result ing in improved  performances  on a  wide range of physiological and skill assessment s.  Furthermore , there was some ( limited ) evidence that higher workloads may be associated with the development of better  physical qualities  , with one study demonstrating enhanced  submaximal interval shuttle run performance  with each additional hour of training or game play . Of the few studies examining negative consequences associated with workloads , increases in  training  load led to increases in  injury rates  , while longer training duration was associated with a  greater incidence of illness .  Conclusion The combined capacity for  adolescent males  to grow , train and improve physical performance highlights and underscores an exciting responsiveness to training in the football environment . However , the capacity to train has some established barriers for adolescents experiencing high workloads , which could also result in negative consequences . Additional research on stage-appropriate training for  adolescent male footballers  is required in order to address the knowledge gaps and enhance  safe and efficient training practice ."
" There is considerable variability in the type of measures utilized to measure  physical impairments  and limitations in  survivors of critical illness .  Future work should identify a core set of st and ardized measures , which can be utilized across the continuum of critical illness recovery embedded within the International Classification of Functioning framework . This will enable improved comparisons between future studies , which in turn will assist in identifying the most effective treatment strategies to ameliorate the devastating longer-term outcomes of a critical illness."
" There is limited , low- quality evidence to support the  use of aquatic exercise  for improving physiological components that are risk factors for falling . Although the evidence is limited , and many interventions are not well described , these results should be considered by health and exercise professionals when making evidence -based , clinical decisions regarding training programmes to reduce the risk of falling."
">The rising epidemic of non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) poses substantial health and economic challenges to both individuals and society . Application of  incentive-based strategies  based on traditional and behavioural economic theory has emerged as a potential strategy to address rising rates of NCDs . Yet , whether or not incentives truly represent a promising strategy for addressing NCDs has not been systematic ally addressed nor is it clear whether certain  behavioural economic strategies  outperform others or simply offering a  cash-based incentive  for meeting a goal . In this systematic review we aim to determine whether there is an evidence base for any of these strategies .  Forty-eight published r and omized controlled trials ( 70 contrasts )  evaluating the effectiveness of  incentive-based strategies  for improvements in  NCD risk-factors  were review ed . Our primary conclusion is that there is a lack of compelling evidence that  incentives  of any form represent a compelling  NCD  reduction strategy . More evidence for  long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness  is needed to justify third party funding of any  incentive based strategy ."
" Addition of a  beta-blocker  to  diuretics  or  calcium-channel blockers  reduces  BP  by 6/4mmHg at 1 times the starting dose and by 8/6 mmHg at 2 times the starting dose . When the  blood pressure  lowering effect of beta-blockers from this review was compared to that of  thiazide diuretics  from our previous review ( Chen 2009 ) ,  second-line beta-blockers  reduce  systolic BP  to the same extent as  second-line thiazide diuretics  , but reduce  diastolic BP  to a greater degree . The different effect on  diastolic BP  means that  beta-blockers  have little or no effect on  pulse pressure  whereas thiazides cause a significant dose-related decrease in  pulse pressure .  This difference in the pattern of  BP lowering  with  beta-blockers  as compared to thiazides might be the explanation for the fact that  beta-blockers  appear to be less effective at reducing  adverse cardiovascular outcomes  than thiazide  diuretics  , particularly in older individuals."
"aPurpose of Review In the past years , the relationship between lower urinary tract symptoms  and erectile dysfunction  has been widely explored . The aim of our systematic review is to summarize the published evidence over the past year on  lower  urinary  tract symptoms ( LUTS )  and   erectile  dysfunction (ED).Recent  Findings Recent data support the relationship between LUTS and ED in Eastern Europe and in Asia . The role of  phosphodiesterase inhibitors  alone or  in combination with alpha blockers  to treat  LUTS and ED  , especially in  younger patients  , is strongly supported by high level of evidence . Summary  LUTS and ED  are prevalent conditions in  men over 50 ;  epidemiologically , the relationship between both conditions has been confirmed all over the world .  PDE5i  alone or in  combination with alpha blockers  can be considered the gold st and ard for the treatment of  young patients with  storage  symptoms and concomitant  ED .   In clinical research , a better underst and ing of the molecular pathways behind this association may also help to identify new possible targets and develop novel therapeutic approaches to manage both disorders ; the identification of new biomarkers of both disorders is also compulsory in this area."
 Our findings are inconsistent with major clinical practice guidelines ; the available evidence suggests no beneficial effects of any therapies that research ers have evaluated in r and omized controlled trials.
"tDespite potential benefits , primary care clinicians may avoid using  antimuscarinics  in  men with overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms  because of safety concerns . To  review the efficacy and safety  of  antimuscarinics , alone or in combination with an α-blocker  , for the treatment of  men with OAB symptoms  , we conducted a systematic review of articles published before 22 July 2010 , using PubMed . Data from 12-week , r and omised , double-blind ,  placebo-controlled  trials of  tolterodine extended release ( ER ) , oxybutynin and solifenacin  show that  combined antimuscarinic+α-blocker treatment  is generally more effective than  monotherapy  or  placebo  in men with OAB symptoms .  The efficacy and safety   of tolterodine ER+α-blocker  treatment was not affected by prostate size or prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level . In  men meeting entry criteria for OAB and benign prostatic obstruction trials   , tolterodine  ER alone was effective selectively in men with prostate size or PSA level below study medians  . Incidence of acute urinary retention ( AUR )  in  men  receiving antimuscarinics with  or  without an α-blocker   was ≤3 % in all of these trials  ; changes in postvoid residual volume and maximum flow rate  did not appear clinical ly meaningful . Post hoc analyses from double-blind ,  placebo-controlled  trials and prospect i ve studies  of fesoterodine , oxybutynin , propiverine , solifenacin and tolterodine  also suggest that  antimuscarinics  are generally  safe and efficacious  in men . A retrospective data base study found  that risk of AUR  in men was the highest in the first month of treatment and decreased considerably  thereafter . Antimuscarinics , alone or with an α-blocker  , appear  to be efficacious and safe  in many men with predominant OAB symptoms or persistent OAB symptoms  despite α-blocker or 5-α-reductase inhibitor  treatment .  However  ,  antimuscarinics  are not approved for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia . Monitoring men for AUR is recommended , especially those at increased risk , and particularly within 30 days after  starting antimuscarinic  treatment."
"sReview s of neighborhood ( macro ) environment characteristics such as the presence of sidewalks and esthetics have shown significant correlations with    resident physical activity  ( PA ) and sedentary ( SD ) behavior  .  Currently , no comprehensive review has appraised and collected available evidence on the home ( micro ) physical environment . The purpose of this review was to examine how the home physical environment relates to  adult and child  PA and SD behaviors .   Articles were search ed during  May 2014  using  Medline ,  PsycINFO , PubMed , Scopus ,  and  SPORTD iscus  data  bases which  yielded 3265 potential studies .  Papers were considered eligible if they investigated the presence of  PA ( ie  .  exercise equipment , exergaming devices )  or  SD ( ie  .  television , videogames ) equipment  and  PA  or   SD behavior   . After , screening and manual cross-referencing ,  49 studies ( 20 experimental and 29 observational design s )  were found to meet the eligibility criteria . Interventions that reduced  sedentary time  by using  TV limiting  devices were shown to be effective for children but the results were limited for adults . Overall , large exercise equipment ( ie . treadmills ) , and prominent exergaming material s ( exergaming bike , dance mats ) were found to be more effective than smaller devices . Observational studies revealed that  location and quantity of televisions  correlated with  SD behavior  with the latter having a greater effect on girls . This was similarly found for the  quantity of  PA  equipment  which also correlated with behavior in females . Given the large market for exercise equipment , videos and exergaming , the limited work performed on its effectiveness in homes is alarming . Future research should focus on developing stronger r and omized controlled trials , investigate the location of  PA  equipment , and examine mediators of the gender discrepancy found in contemporary studies."

"2Background  Yoga  has been recommended as a muscle strengthening and balance activity in national and global physical activity guidelines . However , the evidence base establishing the effectiveness of  yoga  in improving  physical function and health related quality of life ( HRQoL )  in an  older adult population not recruited on the basis of any specific disease or condition  , has not been systematic ally review ed . The objective of this study was to synthesis e existing evidence on the effects of  yoga  on  physical function and HRQoL  in  older adults  not characterised by any specific clinical condition . Methods The following data bases were systematic ally search ed in September 2017 : MEDLINE , PsycInfo , CINAHL Plus , Scopus , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , EMBASE , SPORTD iscus , AMED and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global . Study inclusion criteria :  Older adult participants with mean age of 60 years and above , not recruited on the basis of any specific disease or condition ;   yoga intervention compared with inactive controls (  example :  wait-list control , education booklets ) or active controls  ( example :  walking , chair aerobics ) ;   physical function and HRQoL outcomes  ; and  r and omised/cluster r and omised controlled trials  published in English . A vote counting analysis and meta- analysis with st and ardised effect sizes ( Hedges ’ g ) computed using r and om effects models were conducted . Results  A total of 27 records from 22 RCTs were included  ( 17 RCTs assessed physical function and 20 assessed HRQoL ) . The meta- analysis revealed significant effects ( 5 % level of significance ) favouring the  yoga  group for the following  physical function  outcomes compared with inactive  controls : balance  ( effect size ( ES ) = 0.7 ) ,  lower body flexibility  ( ES = 0.5 ) ,  lower limb strength  ( ES = 0.45 ) ; compared with active  controls : lower limb strength  ( ES = 0.49 ) ,  lower body flexibility  ( ES = 0.28 ) . For  HRQoL  , significant effects favouring yoga were found compared to inactive controls for  : depression  ( ES = 0.64 ) ,  perceived mental health  ( ES = 0.6 ) ,  perceived physical health  ( ES = 0.61 ) ,  sleep quality  ( ES = 0.65 ) ,  and vitality  ( ES = 0.31 ) ; compared to active  controls  :   depression ( ES = 0.54 ) . Conclusion This review is the first to compare the effects of  yoga  with active and inactive  controls  in older adults not characterised by a specific clinical condition . Results indicate that  yoga  interventions  improve multiple physical function and  HRQoL outcomes in this population compared to both control conditions . This study provides robust evidence for promoting yoga in physical activity guidelines for older adults as a multimodal activity that improves  aspects of fitness like strength , balance and flexibility , as well as mental wellbeing  .

sWe conducted a systematic review of the literature about  home telemonitoring  compared with  usual care .  An electronic literature search was conducted to identify studies of  home  telemonitoring   use  in congestive heart failure ( CHF ) patients . Twenty-one original studies on  home telemonitoring  for patients with CHF were included ( 3082 patients ) .  A r and om effects model was used to compute treatment  efficacy  to measure the average effect of the intervention across all studies where the quantitative pooling of results was appropriate .  Home telemonitoring   reduced mortality  ( risk ratio = 0.64 ; 95 % CI : 0.48–0.85 ) compared with  usual care .  Several studies suggested that  home telemonitoring  also helped to  lower the number of hospitalizations and the use of other health services . Patient quality of life and satisfaction  with  home telemonitoring  were similar or better than with  usual care .  More studies of higher method ological quality are required to give more precise information about the potential clinical effectiveness of home telehealth interventions.

D : Meta‐ analysis of the effect of  resveratrol supplementation  on triglyceride after removing the study by Zortea et al. & NA ; Despite the notion that  resveratrol  can significantly reduce plasma lipids , the result of r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) on  resveratrol  effect and the  serum lipid profile  are contradictory . Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta‐ analysis on r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) and assess the effect of  resveratrol  on lipids . ISI web of science , Ovid , PubMed / Medline , SCOPUS , and Google Scholar data bases were search ed up to Jun 2017 . RCTs that assessed   resveratrol  effects on lipid profile among adult participants were chosen .  Treatment effects were considered as weighted mean difference ( WMD ) and the corresponding st and ard error ( SE ) in concentrations of serum lipids . To estimate the overall summary effect , we used r and om‐effects model . The protocol was registered with PROSPERO ( No. CRD42017072365 ) . This meta‐ analysis was performed on  twenty‐one trials .  Our results indicated  that resveratrol  ca n't significantly  change total cholesterol ( TC )  ( WMD = −0.08 mmol/l , 95 % CI : −0.23 , 0.08 ; P = .349 , I2 =  87.8 % ) , low‐density lipoprotein ( LDL‐C )  ( WMD : −0.04 mmol/l , 95 % CI : −0.21 , 0.12 ; P = .620 , I2 = 93.4  % ) , and high density lipoprotein ( HDL‐C )  ( WMD : −0.01 mmol/l , 95 % CI : −0.04 , 0.02 ; P = .269 , I2 =  88.6 % )  .  Its effect on triacylglycerol ( TG )  ( WMD : 0.58 mmol/l , 95 % CI : 0.34 , 0.82 ; P < .0001 , I2 = 99.8 % ) , was significant , but after removing one study the significance was eliminated . We also found that sex , age ,  BMI , resveratrol  dosage , and intervention duration could not change the results . We conclude  that resveratrol  does  not change lipid profile concentration  . Confirmation of this  conclusion  will require more studies exclusively on  dyslipidemic patients in which the intake of  lipid lowering agents   is among the exclusion criteria."
" Our study suggests that by providing lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and less  postoperative acute pain  ,  high-dose systemic steroid  plays a critical role in rapid recovery to TKA and THA .

More large , high- quality studies that investigate the safety and dose – response relationship are necessary."
"lCausal links between  vitamin D status [ 25(OH)D ]  and systemic inflammation were examined through a systematic review of r and omized  controlled trials  ( RCTs ) . Selected RCTs were  ⩾12 weeks  ,  conducted in adults free of acute inflammatory disease , and of high- quality ( Jadad score ⩾3 ) . Of 14 studies that met our criteria , 9 studies ( 15 study arms )  permitted extraction of data . There was no effect on  the weighted mean difference ( WMD ) of IL-6  ( WMD ( 95 % confidence interval)=0.1 , ( −0.166 , 0.366 ) pg/ml , P=0.462 )  or C-reactive protein (  CRP ) ( WMD=−0.324 , ( −1.007 , 0.359 ) mg/l , P=0.352 ) . Subgroup analyses of trials achieving ⩾80 nmol/l indicated a trend for  lower  CRP ( WMD=−0.834 , ( −1.726 , 0.058 ) mg/l , P=0.067 ) , however heterogeneity was significant ( I2=66.7 % , P=0.017 ) . Studies employing a low dose ( < 1000 IU/d )  showed increased  CRP ( WMD=0.615 , ( 0.132 , 1.098 ) , P=0.013 ) . In contrast , ⩾1000 IU/d had a  favourable effect on  CRP ( WMD=−0.939 , ( −1.805 , −0.073 ) , P=0.034 )  but  heterogeneity was significant ( I2=61.3 % ,  P=0.017  ) . Meta-regression indicated that older age predicted a significant  decrease in  IL−6 ( β=−0.02 , ( −0.034 , −0.006 ) pg/ml ,  P=0.013  ) and CRP ( β=−0.06 , ( −0.103 , −0.017 ) , P=0.01 ) , whereas a greater percentage of females ( β=0.027 , ( 0.011 , 0.044 ) , P=0.004 ) and longer study duration independently predicted  a higher WMD for  CRP ( β=0.049 , ( 0.018 , 0.079 ) , P=0.005 ) . Available high- quality RCTs did not support a  beneficial effect  of cholecalciferol  on systemic IL-6 and  CRP . Future studies should consider the confounding effects of age , gender and study duration , while possibly targeting an achieved 25(OH)D ⩾80 nmol/l."

"dOBJECTIVE The RTI International-University  of North Carolina at Chapel  Hill Evidence -based Practice Center ( RTI-UNC EPC ) systematic ally review ed evidence on efficacy of treatment for  anorexia nervosa ( AN )  , harms associated with treatments , factors associated with treatment efficacy , and differential outcome by sociodemographic characteristics . METHOD We search ed  six major data bases for studies on the treatment of AN from 1980 to September 2005 , in all language s against a priori inclusion /exclusion criteria focusing on eating , psychiatric or psychological , or biomarker outcomes .  RESULTS  Thirty-two treatment studies  involved only  medications  , only  behavioral interventions  , and  medication plus behavioral interventions  for  adults or adolescents .  The literature on medication treatments and  behavioral treatments  for adults with AN is sparse and inconclusive .  Cognitive behavioral therapy  may reduce  relapse risk  for adults with AN after weight restoration , although its efficacy in the underweight state remains unknown .  Variants of family therapy  are  efficacious  in adolescents , but not in adults .  Evidence for AN treatment is weak ; evidence for treatment-related harms and factors associated with efficacy of treatment are weak ; and evidence for differential outcome by sociodemographic factors is nonexistent . Attention to sample size and statistical power , st and ardization of outcome measures , retention of patients in clinical trials , and developmental differences in treatment appropriateness and outcome is required."

"eBackground and aim Because low serum zinc levels precipitate hepatic encephalopathy ,  zinc supplementation  is considered a potential therapeutic option . The aim of this study was to assess the effects of  oral zinc supplementation  in the treatment of  hepatic  encephalopathy . Methods For this systematic review and meta- analysis , data sources included electronic data bases ( CENTRAL , MEDLINE , EMBASE ) and manual search ing .  R and omized clinical trials of adult patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy  were included . The types of interventions considered were any  oral zinc supplementation versus no intervention , placebo  , or  other interventions  for the management of hepatic encephalopathy . The data were analyzed by calculating the RR for each trial and expressing the uncertainty as 95 % CI . Continuous data were analyzed by calculating the st and ard mean differences ( SMD ) between groups within each trial and their 95 % CI . Statistical heterogeneity was defined as a P-value > 0.10 ( χ2 ) or I2 > 25 % . Results  Four trials with a total of 233 patients were included .   Oral zinc supplementation  was associated with a significant improvement  in performance on the number connection test  ( SMD –0.62 ; 95 % CI –1.12 to –0.11 ) reported in three trials ( n = 189 ) , but not with  encephalopathy recurrence reduction  ( RR 0.64 ; 95 % CI 0.26 to 1.59 ) reported in two trials ( n = 169 ) . Other clinical ly significant outcomes  ( mortality , liver related morbidity , quality of life  ) were not reported .  Conclusion Oral zinc  supplementation  improved performance on the number connection test  , but no evidence about other clinical or biochemical outcomes was available."

"dBackground The purpose of this systematic review and meta- analysis is to investigate the effects of  vitamin D3 supplementation  on  skeletal muscle strength in athletes .   Vitamin D3 supplements  or  vitamin D3 fortified  foods always have cl aims for bringing people health benefits including bone and muscle health . An up-to- date rigorous systematic review and meta- analysis is important to better underst and the effect of  vitamin D3 supplementation  on muscle strength . Methods English written r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that looked at effects of  vitamin D3 supplementation  on muscle strength in  healthy athletes  were search ed using three data bases ( PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Library ) . Serum 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL is considered to be sufficient in this systematic review and meta- analysis . Results  Five RCTs with 163 athletes  ( vitamin  D3 n = 86 , placebo n = 77 ) met inclusion criteria  . Fourteen athletes were lost to follow-up and  149 athletes  (  vitamin D3 n = 80 , placebo n = 69 )  were documented with complete result . Among athletes with baseline  serum 25(OH)D  values suggesting insufficiency  , vitamin D3  daily dosage at 5000 IU for over 4 weeks led to a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 31.7 ng/mL.  Athletes with sufficient serum 25(OH)D level at baseline  were recruited in only one study , and the participants of which were assigned to  either vitamin D3  at a daily dosage of 3570 IU  or placebo  for 12 weeks , their  serum 25(OH)D sufficiency  ( VD : 37.2 ± 7.6 vs. 45.6 ± 7.6 ; PL : 38 ± 6.8 vs. 32 ± 8.4 ) was well maintained above the cut-off boundary .  One repetition maximum Bench Press  ( 1-RM BP ) was not improved significantly ( SMD 0.07 , 95 % CI : − 0.32 to 0.47 , P = 0.72 ) and there was no significant increase in  maximal quadriceps contraction  ( SMD -2.14 , 95 % CI : − 4.87 to 0.59 , P = 0.12 ) . Furthermore , there was no significant overall   effect of vitamin  D3   intervention on muscle strength  in this meta- analysis ( SMD -0.75 , 95 % CI : − 1.82 to 0.32 , P = 0.17 ) . Conclusion Although , serum  25(OH)D  concentrations after supplementation reached sufficiency was observed ,  muscle strength  did not significantly improve at this point of current meta- analysis . Additional well- design ed RCTs with large number of participants examined for the effect of  vitamin D3 supplementation  on  serum 25(OH)D concentrations , muscle strength  in a variety of sports , latitudes and diverse multicultural population s are needed."
"tBackground : Chronic pain is highly prevalent . Current management is challenged by lack of vali date d objective measures like biological markers . Clinical pain studies employing  exercise interventions  have evaluated biomarkers ; however , it is unclear how  exercise  impacts biomarkers involved in pain pathways and whether these markers are associated with relevant pain-related outcomes . This systematic review evaluates data from clinical studies employing  exercise interventions  in  chronic musculoskeletal nonmalignant pain conditions  in which biomarkers in pain pathways were measured . Method : Published research studies from several data bases were examined using the  Jadad Scale  for assessing the  quality of clinical studies .  Results :  Twelve research studies were  review ed .  Jadad scores  ranged from 5 to 11 out of 13 points .  Inflammatory markers  were most commonly measured followed by  neurotransmitter-related genes  and  metabolite-detecting genes  . After  exercise interventions  , changes in  biomarkers involved in neurotransmission and inflammation  suggest a  hypoalgesic  exercise effect . Significant biomarker associations were found with  pain intensity , fatigue , depression , anxiety , and quality of life .  However , there were varying method ologies in the studies review ed . Discussion : It remains a question whether biomarkers can be used as objective measures for risk assessment , diagnosis , or evaluation or as surrogate endpoints in chronic pain . Adequate sample sizes , optimal  exercise  dose determination , study replications , and longitudinal research studies with consistent method ologies are warranted . Regardless , the potential translational value of biomarkers in chronic pain is evident . Advancing nursing research in biomarkers is vital for moving the nursing discipline and clinical chronic pain practice forward . Developing a biobehavioral perspective in chronic pain is also necessary for comprehensive management."

" The available evidence provides a best-case scenario for when patients can return to driving . It is important for  observer-reported outcome measures  to have normalized before a patient can consider driving , but other factors such as  strength ,  ROM , and use of opioid  analgesics  need to be considered . This review can provide a guideline for when physicians can begin to consider evaluating these other factors and discussing a return to driving with patients . Survey data suggest that patients are returning to driving before  observer-reported outcome measures  have normalized , indicating that physicians should tell patients to wait longer before driving . Further research is needed to correlate  observer-reported outcome measures with adverse events , such as motor vehicle accidents  , and clinical tests that can be performed in the office .

"hThe effectiveness of  lifestyle interventions  within secondary prevention of  coronary heart disease ( CHD )  remains unclear . This systematic review aim ed to determine their effectiveness and included r and omized controlled trials of  lifestyle interventions  , in primary care or community setting s , with a minimum follow-up of three months , published since 1990 .  21 trials with 10,799 patients were included ;  the interventions were  multifactorial  ( 10 )  , educational  ( 4 ) ,  psychological  ( 3 )  , dietary  ( 1 )  , organisational  ( 2 ) , and  exercise  ( 1 ) . The overall results for modifiable risk factors suggested  improvements in dietary and exercise outcomes  but no  overall effect on smoking outcomes .  In trials that examined  mortality and morbidity  , significant benefits were reported for  total mortality  ( in 4 of 6 trials ; overall risk ratio ( RR ) 0.75 ( 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) 0.65 , 0.87 ) ) ,  cardiovascular mortality  ( 3 of 8 trials ; overall RR 0.63 ( 95 % CI 0.47 , 0.84 ) ) , and  nonfatal cardiac events  ( 5 of 9 trials ; overall RR 0.68 ( 95 % CI 0.55 , 0.84 ) ) . The heterogeneity between trials and generally poor quality of trials make any concrete conclusions difficult . However , the beneficial  effects  observed in this review are encouraging and should stimulate further research."
"  Topical corticosteroids  offer an effective alternative for  treating  phimosis  in boys .  Although sub optimal reporting among the included studies meant that the size of the effect remains uncertain , corticosteroids appear to be a  safe ,  less invasive first-line treatment option before undertaking surgery to correct phimosis in boys."

"sCONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE Choosing the best  anesthetic technique  for  urological surgery  with the aim of  mortality reduction  remains controversial . The objective here was to compare the  effectiveness and safety  of  neuraxial anesthesia  versus  general anesthesia  for  urological surgery .  DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review ,  Universidade Federal de Alagoas .  METHODS We search ed the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library (  Issue  10 , 2012  )  , Medline via PubMed ( 1966 to October 2012 ) , Lilacs ( 1982 to October 2012 ) , SciELO and EMBASE ( 1974 to October 2012 ) . The reference lists of the studies included and of one systematic review in the same field were also analyzed . The studies included were r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) that analyzed   neuraxial  anesthesia  and  general anesthesia  for   urological  surgery  .   RESULTS The titles and abstract s of  2720 articles  were analyzed . Among these ,  16 studies were identified and 11 fulfilled  the inclusion criteria . One RCT was published twice . The study validity was :  Jadad score  > 3 in one RCT ; seven RCTs with unclear  risk of bias  as the most common response ; and five RCTs not fulfilling half of the Delphi list items . The  frequency of mortality  was not significant between study groups in three RCTs . Meta- analysis was not performed .  At the moment , the evidence available can not prove that  neuraxial anesthesia  is more  effective and safer  than  general anesthesia  for urological surgery . There were insufficient data to pool the results relating to mortality , stroke , myocardial infa rct ion , length of hospitalization , quality of life , degree of satisfaction , postoperative cognitive dysfunction and blood transfusion requirements."
" Utilizing a  consumer-based wearable activity tracker  as either the primary component of an intervention or as part of a broader physical activity intervention has the potential to increase  physical activity participation .  As the effects of physical activity interventions are often short term , the inclusion of a consumer-based  wearable activity tracker  may provide an effective tool to assist health professionals to provide ongoing monitoring and support."
"sObjective : To determine the ability of clinical  measures  of  balance  to distinguish fallers from non-fallers and to determine their predictive validity in identifying those at risk of falls . Data sources : AMED , CINAHL , Medline , Scopus , PubMed Central and Google Scholar . First search : July 2015 . Final search : October 2017 . Review methods : Inclusion  criteria  were  studies of adults with a definite multiple sclerosis diagnosis , a clinical balance assessment and method of falls recording .  Data were extracted independently by two review ers .  Study quality was  assessed using  the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies -2 scale  and the  modified Newcastle – Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale .  Statistical analysis was conducted for the cross-sectional studies using Review Manager 5 . The  mean difference  with 95 %  confidence interval  in  balance outcomes  between fallers and non-fallers was used as the mode of analysis . Results : We included  33 studies ( 19 cross-sectional , 5 r and omised  controlled trials , 9  prospect i ve ) with a total of 3901 participants , of which 1917 ( 49 % ) were classified as fallers .  The balance measures most commonly reported were the  Berg Balance Scale , Timed Up and Go and Falls Efficacy Scale International  . Meta- analysis demonstrated fallers perform significantly worse than non-fallers on all measures analysed except the  Timed Up and Go Cognitive  ( p < 0.05 ) , but discriminative ability of the measures is commonly not reported . Of those reported , the  Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale  had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value ( 0.92 ) , but without reporting corresponding measures of clinical utility . Conclusion : Clinical measures of  balance  differ significantly between fallers and non-fallers but have poor predictive ability for falls risk in people with multiple sclerosis."
"sThis study aim ed to compare the  longevity  of different  conventional restorative material s  placed in  posterior primary teeth .  This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA statement and registered in PROSPERO ( CRD42016035775 ) . A comprehensive electronic search without date or language restrictions was performed in PubMed / MEDLINE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Scopus , Turning Research Into Practice ( TRIP ) and Clinical Trials data bases up to January 2017 , selecting  r and omized clinical trials that  assessed the longevity of at least  two different  conventional restorative material s  performed in primary molars . Seventeen studies were included in this systematic review .  Pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed and  relative risks  and  95 % confidence intervals ( CI )  calculated . Two review ers independently selected the studies , extracted the data , and assessed the  risk of bias  . Restorations  of primary molars  with  conventional glass ionomer cement  showed  increased risk of failure  than  compomer , resin-modified glass ionomer cement , amalgam  , and  composite resin .   Risk of bias  was low in most studies ( 45.38 % of all items across studies ) .  Pediatric  dentists should avoid  conventional glass ionomer cement  for restoring primary molars."
"yThe relationship between higher  body mass index  ( BMI ) ,  decreased morbidity and mortality  is known as the "" obesity paradox "" , and has been described in cohorts of  patients with hypertension , diabetes , heart failure , coronary and peripheral artery diseases , non-cardiac surgery , and end-stage renal disease .  Here we investigated the relationship between  BMI  and short-term outcomes after  adult cardiac surgery  to explore the existence of an obesity paradoxical effect . A secondary objective was to perform an up date d systematic review to further analyze the association between  BMI  and  30-day in-hospital mortality  after cardiac surgery  .  A retrospective analysis was performed from a  consecutive series of 1823 adult patients who underwent  cardiac surgery  , that were assigned to five BMI groups :  normal weight  ( 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2 ) , overweight ( 25 - 29.9 kg/m2 ) , class I obese ( 30 - 34.9 kg/m2 ) , class II obese ( 35 - 39.9 kg/m2 ) , and class III obese or morbidly obese ( 40 - 49.9 kg/m2 ) .  A systematic review search was performed including controlled trials and observational studies identified in MEDLINE , Embase , SCOPUS , and the Cochrane library ( to the end of June 2017 ) . In the present series , overweight and obese patients had similar or slightly  lower in-hospital mortality rates  after cardiac surgery compared with normal-weight individuals . Conversely ,  postoperative complication rates  increased with higher BMI levels . Most studies included in the review showed that overweight and obese patients had at least the same  mortality rate  as normal-weight patients , or even a  lower death risk .  Pooled- data of the meta- analysis provided evidence on the association between  higher BMI levels  and a  lower all-cause in-hospital mortality rate  after cardiac surgery."
"rThere is growing interest in using  cannabinoids  for  chronic pain .  We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of  cannabinoids  for  chronic non-cancer pain .  PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , Cochrane CENTRAL and clinical trials.gov were search ed up to December 2018 . Information on the type , dosage , route of administration , pain conditions , pain scores , and adverse events were extracted for qualitative analysis . Meta- analysis of  analgesic efficacy  was performed . Meta-regression was performed to compare the  analgesic efficacy  for different pain conditions ( neuropathic versus non-neuropathic pain ) . Risk of bias was assessed by The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool , and the strength of the evidence was assessed using the Grade of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach .  Forty-three r and omized controlled trials were included .  Meta- analysis was performed for 33 studies that compared  cannabinoids to placebo  , and showed a  mean pain score  ( scale 0–10 ) reduction of −0.70 ( p < 0.001 , r and om effect ) . Meta-regression showed  that analgesic efficacy  was similar for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain ( Difference = −0.14 , p = 0.262 ) . Inhaled , oral , and oromucosal administration all provided statistically significant , but small  reduction in mean pain  score ( −0.97 , −0.85 , −0.45 , all  p < 0.001 )  . Incidence of  serious adverse  events was rare , and non-serious adverse events were usually mild to moderate . Heterogeneity was moderate . The GRADE level of evidence was low to moderate  .  Pain intensity  of  chronic non-cancer  patients  was reduced by  cannabinoids  consumption , but effect sizes were  small . Efficacy  for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain was similar."
"(Abstract Objective To review the evidence and provide recommendations on  antibiotic prophylaxis  for  obstetrical procedures .  Outcomes Outcomes evaluated include  need and effectiveness of  antibiotics   to prevent infections in obstetrical procedures . Evidence Published literature was retrieved through search es of Medline and The Cochrane Library on the topic of antibiotic prophylaxis in  obstetrical procedures .  Results were restricted to systematic review s , r and omized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials , and observational studies . Search es were up date d on a regular basis and articles published from January 1978 to June 2009 were incorporated in the guideline . Current guidelines published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology were also incorporated . Grey ( unpublished ) literature was identified through search ing the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment -related agencies , clinical practice guideline collection s , clinical trial registries , and national and international medical specialty societies . Values The evidence obtained was review ed and evaluated by the Infectious Diseases Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada under the leadership of the principal authors , and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care ( Table 1 ) . Benefits , Harms , and Costs Implementation of this guideline should reduce the cost and harm result ing from the administration of antibiotics when they are not required and the harm result ing from failure to administer antibiotics when they would be beneficial . Summary Statements 1 . Available evidence does not support the use of prophylactic  antibiotics  to reduce  infectious morbidity  following operative vaginal delivery . ( II-1 ) 2 . There is insufficient evidence to argue for or against the use of prophylactic  antibiotics  to reduce  infectious morbidity  for manual removal of the placenta . ( III ) 3 . There is insufficient evidence to argue for or against the use of prophylactic  antibiotics  at the time of postpartum dilatation and curettage for retained products of conception . ( III ) 4 . Available evidence does not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce  infectious morbidity  following elective or emergency cerclage . ( II-3 ) Recommendations 1 . All women undergoing elective  or emergency Caesarean section  should receive  antibiotic  prophylaxis . ( I-A ) 2 . The choice of antibiotic for Caesarean section should be a single dose of a  first-generation cephalosporin .  If the patient has a penicillin allergy , clindamycin or erythromycin can be used . ( I-A ) 3 . The timing of  prophylactic antibiotics  for Caesarean section should be 15 to 60minutes prior to skin incision . No additional doses are recommended . ( I-A ) 4 . If an open abdominal procedure is lengthy ( > 3hours )  or estimated blood loss  is greater than 1500mL , an additional dose of the  prophylactic antibiotic  may be given 3 to 4hours after the initial dose . ( III-L ) 5 .  Prophylactic antibiotics  may be considered for the reduction of  infectious morbidity  associated with repair of third and fourth degree perineal injury . ( I-B ) 6 . In  patients with morbid obesity ( BMI > 35 )  , doubling the  antibiotic  dose may be considered . ( III-B ) 7 .  Antibiotics  should not be administered solely to prevent endocarditis for  patients who undergo an obstetrical procedure of  any kind . (."
"eThe rate of  type-2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D )  is dramatically increasing worldwide . Continuing diabetes mellitus ( DM ) care needs effective self-management education and support for both patients and family members . This study aim ed to review and describe the impacts of  diabetes mellitus self-management education ( DSME )  that involve family  members  on patient outcomes related to  patient health behaviors and perceived self-efficacy on self-management such as medication adherence , blood glucose monitoring , diet and exercise changes , health outcomes including psychological well-being and self-efficacy , and physiological markers including body mass index , level of blood pressure , cholesterol level and glycemic control .  Three data bases , PubMed , CINAHL , and Scopus were review ed for relevant articles . The search terms were "" type 2 diabetes , "" "" self-management , "" ""  diabetes self-management education  ( DSME  )  , "" "" family support , "" "" social support , "" and "" uncontrolled glycaemia . "" Joanna Briggs Institute ( JBI ) guidelines were used to determine which studies to include in the review . Details of the  family support components of DSME intervention  and the impacts of these interventions had on improving the  health outcomes   patients with uncontrolled glycaemia patients .  A total of  22 intervention studies were identified  . These studies involved different  DSME  strategies , different components of  family support  provided , and different health outcomes to be measured among T2D patients . Overall , family support had a  positive impact on healthy diet , increased perceived support , higher self-efficacy , improved psychological well-being and better glycemic control .  This systematic review found evidence that DSME with family support  improved self-management behaviors and health outcomes  among  uncontrolled glycaemia  T2D  patients  . The findings suggest DSME models that include family engagement can be a useful direction for improving diabetes care."

"sBACKGROUND  Potassium-sparing diuretics ( PSDs )  are valuable antihypertensives with additional benefits unrelated to control of  systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) .  However , their key parameters affecting  SBP and serum potassium  are poorly defined , fostering underutilization . METHOD Consequently , we conducted systematic review s and meta-analyses ,  yielding 3668 articles and ultimately 84 r and omized comparisons .  RESULTS For office SBP , overall  placebo-adjusted  changes were  triamterene -1.9  ( low dose only ) ,  amiloride -9.9 , spironolactone -13.2  , and  eplerenone -9.2  . Differences in  antihypertensive effect  were due to potency rather than efficacy . Doubling  amiloride  , eplerenone , and spironolactone doses  reduced SBP  ( 95 % confidence limits ) on average by -2.3 ( -3.1 , -1.5 ) . Relative  antihypertensive  potencies were  spironolactone > amiloride  >  eplerenone . Spironolactone  had significantly  greater antihypertensive potency  than amiloride , -4.0 ( -7.4 , -0.6 ) , and eplerenone , -5.5 ( -7.4 , -3.6 ) . Dose equivalencies were  eplerenone-spironolactone  4.5-to-1 ( e.g. ,  eplerenone  125∼spironolactone 25 ) ,  amiloride-spironolactone  3.3-to-1 , and  eplerenone-amiloride  1.4-to-1 .  Increases in serum potassium  from amiloride and spironolactone at commonly used doses averaged 0.14 - 0.29 mEq/l ; the dose doubling effect was 0.16 ( 0.10 , 0.22 ) .  Spironolactone  caused  greater hyperkalemia  than amiloride across their dose ranges : 0.14 , P = 0.043 . Seven features make important bias unlikely : a comprehensive literature search , adjustment for covariates , all models explaining 95 - 100 % of the between- study variability , similar dose doubling effects among PSDs , two different methods giving the same potency sequence , similar results from double blind comparisons , and similar results for eplerenone versus spironolactone from analysing direct comparison data ( i.e. , no meta-regression ) for office and 24-h SBP .  This synthesis accomplishes for PSDs what has already been achieved  for thiazide-type diuretics  and  other antihypertensives  and can guide the application of these underutilized medicines."
"sA systematic review and meta- analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of  yoga  on  glycemic control , lipid profiles , body composition and blood pressure  in  people in the pre-diabetic state .  Studies on the effectiveness of  yoga  on  population groups under high risk for diabetes , called prediabetic or suffering from metabolic syndromes  were extracted from a thorough search of PubMed , Scopus , Cochrane Library , EBSCO and IndMED data bases . Both R and omised Controlled Trial ( RCT ) and non- RCT studies were included in the systematic review and meta- analysis .  Studies published between Jan 2002 and Dec 2018 were included .  Studies were considered for evaluation if they investigated a  yoga intervention  to prevent T2DM , against a control group , while also reporting glycemic control and other health parameters of T2DM management . Summary  effect sizes  and  95 % confidence intervals ( CI )  were calculated using the Comprehensive Meta- Analysis software in addition to publication bias .  Of the 46,500 identified studies , 14 studies with 834 participants of whom were 50 % women , were found to be eligible for inclusion in  our systematic review . Our quantitative synthesis included 12 r and omized control trials and 2 non-r and omized control trials , with the follow-up period ranging from 4 to 52 weeks . Compared to  controls , yoga intervention  improved  fasting blood glucose ( FBG )  [ St and ard Mean Difference ( SMD -0.064 mg/dL ( 95 % CI -0.201 to 0.074 ) ] ;  low density lipoprotein ( LDL )  [ SMD-0.090 mg/dL ( 95 % CI -0.270 to 0.090 ) ] ;  triglycerides  [ SMD -0.148 mg/dL ( 95 % CI -0.285 to -0.012 ) ] ;  total cholesterol  [ SMD -0.058 mg/dL ( 95 % CI -0.220 to 0.104 ) ] and  systolic blood pressure  [ SMD -0.058 mm Hg ( 95 % CI -0.168 to 0.053 ) ] . This meta- analysis uncovered clinical ly improved effects  of yoga intervention  on  glycemic control , lipid profiles and other parameters of T2DM management  in  prediabetic population .  These results suggest that  yoga intervention  may be considered as a comprehensive and alternative approach to preventing  T2DM  . Further adequately powered , well design ed RCTs are needed to support our findings and investigate the long-term effects of  yoga  in T2DM patients."

">BACKGROUND  Iodine  , an essential micronutrient , plays a critical role in normal growth and development , especially during the first two years of life . This systematic review and meta- analysis is among the first to evaluate  breast-milk iodine concentrations and infant iodine status  in  countries characterized by iodine sufficiency or deficiency .  METHODS PubMed , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , Google Scholar , and other relevant data bases , as well as reference lists of previous review s , were search ed for  relevant studies published between 1986 and 2016 .   Mean or median breast-milk and infant urinary iodine concentrations  , along with other relevant data , were extracted from eligible studies . Each study was assessed for quality and risk of bias . RESULTS Of  the 496 identified studies , 57 met the criteria for inclusion in the meta- analysis .   The mean ( confidence interval [ CI ] ) iodine concentrations  in maternal colostrum were 152.0 μg/L [ CI 106.2 - 198.7 μg/L ] and 57.8 μg/L [ CI 41.4 - 74.1 μg/L ] in iodine-sufficient and -deficient countries , respectively , indicating a significant difference between the two iodine statuses . By contrast , the corresponding values in mature  milk  did not differ significantly between mothers in iodine-sufficient and -deficient countries ( 71.5 μg/L [ CI 51.0 - 92.0 μg/L ] and 28.0 μg/L [ CI -13.8 to 69.9 μg/L ] , respectively ] . The  weighted urinary iodine levels [ CIs  ] of breast-fed infants in iodine-sufficient countries were significantly higher than those in iodine-deficient countries ( 164.5 μg/L [ CI 116.4 - 212.7 μg/L ] vs. 70.4 μg/L [ CI 46.2 - 94.6 μg/L ] ) . Similarly , a significant difference was observed in the  pooled estimates of urinary iodine levels  [ CIs ] among formula-fed infants in iodine-sufficient versus iodine-deficient countries ( 310.3 μg/L [ CI 287.4 - 342.1 μg/L ] vs. 38.3 μg/L [ CI 23.4 - 53.2 μg/L ] ) .  The meta- analysis reveals that in iodine-sufficient countries , the  mean iodine  concentrations in colostrum and mature breast milk corresponded to iodine sufficiency among infants . The results are thus compatible with the international recommendation that lactating women and infants  younger than two years of age who reside in iodine-sufficient countries  do not require  iodine supplementation ."
"nDifferent cognitive impairments have been reported as a result of long-term  MDMA/ecstasy  use . Increased  impulsivity  and altered  decision-making  have been shown to be associated with the development and maintenance of addictive disorders pointing toward the necessity to underst and a potential impairment of decision-making due to  MDMA  use . Thus , assessing the long-term effects of  MDMA  is crucial in order to evaluate its controversially discussed therapeutic use . The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the scientific literature on potential effects of chronic  MDMA  use on higher order decision-making processes in humans . Therefore , a systematic search for controlled trials relevant to the topic has been performed . Only studies using specific tasks on decision-making were included that involved  subjects in the drug-free interval with drug-naïve , and /or  polydrug  control groups .  A  total  of  12 studies could be identified  that met the inclusion criteria , all of which were cross-sectional studies . The findings on  decision-making disturbances  in   MDMA  users  were heterogeneous . Seven studies reported increased  risky decisions  , whereas five studies did not find  MDMA-specific  influences on decision-making . Increased  impulsivity  was observed both in   MDMA  groups and  in  (poly)drug  control groups in almost all studies . Thus , the current state of research does not allow for the conclusion that long-term use of  MDMA  affects  decision-making behavior  in general . More detailed specifications as well as further investigations of the relevant processes are needed . Significant tendencies toward  risky decision-making  among long-term  MDMA  use have been observed , but need to be confirmed by studies using a longitudinal design."
"sThe Breast Cancer Disease Site Group of  Cancer Care Ontario  identified the need for new guidelines for the  adjuvant systemic therapy  of  early-stage breast cancer .  The specific question to be addressed was "" What is the optimal  adjuvant systemic therapy  for  female patients with early-stage operable breast cancer , when patient and disease factors are considered  ? "" A systematic review was prepared based on literature search es conducted using the  medline and embase data bases for the period January 2008 to March 5 , 2012 , and up date d to May 12 , 2014 .  Guidelines were located from that search , from the St and ards and Guidelines Evidence directory of cancer guidelines , and from the Web sites of major guideline organizations . The literature located was subdivided into the broad categories of  chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , and therapy targeted to  her2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) . Although several of the systemic  therapies  discussed in this guideline can be considered in the neoadjuvant setting , the review focused on trials with  rates of disease-free and overall survival  as endpoints and thus excluded several trials that used  pathologic complete response  as a primary endpoint . Based on the systematic review , the working group drafted recommendations on the use  of chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , and targeted therapy ;  based on their professional experience , they also drafted recommendations on patient and disease characteristics and recurrence risk . The literature review and draft recommendations were circulated to a consensus panel of medical oncologists who had expertise in breast  cancer  and who represented the  regions of Ontario .  Items without initial consensus were discussed at an in-person consensus meeting held in Toronto , November 23 , 2012 . The final recommendations are those for which consensus was reached before or at the meeting . Some of the key evidence was revised after the up date d literature search . Evidence review s for   systemic chemotherapy , endocrine therapy   , and   targeted  therapy  for her2-positive disease are reported in separate articles in this supplement . The full three-part 1 - 21 evidence -based series , including complete details of the development and consensus processes , can be found on the Cancer Care Ontario Web site at https://www.cancercare.on.ca/toolbox/ quality guidelines /diseasesite/breast-ebs."

"lBackground Previous versions of the guideline from the  Program  in Evidence  -Based  Care ( pebc  )  at  Ontario Health ( Cancer Care Ontario )  recommended that the use of  high-dose interferon alfa 2b therapy  be discussed and offered to  patients with resected cutaneous melanoma with a high risk of recurrence .  Subsequently , several clinical trials in  patients with resected or metastatic melanoma  found that immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies have a benefit greater than that with  interferon .  It was therefore considered timely for an up date to the guideline about adjuvant  systemic therapy  in melanoma . Methods The present guideline was developed by the  pebc and the Melanoma Disease Site Group ( dsg ) .  Based on a systematic review from a literature search conducted using medline , embase , and the Evidence Based Medicine Review s data bases for the period 1996 to 28 May 2019 , the Working Group drafted recommendations . The systematic review and recommendations were then circulated to the Melanoma dsg and the pebc Report Approval Panel for internal review ; the revised document underwent external review . Recommendations For  patients with completely resected cutaneous or mucosal melanoma with a high risk of recurrence  , the recommended  adjuvant therapies  are  nivolumab , pembrolizumab  ,  or dabrafenib-trametinib  for patients with BRAF V600E or V600 K mutations ;  nivolumab or pembrolizumab  are recommend for  patients with BRAF wild-type disease .  Use of ipilimumab is not recommended . Molecular testing should be conducted to help guide treatment decisions .  Interferon alfa , chemotherapy regimens  ,  vaccines ,  levamisole , bevacizumab , bacillus Calmette-Guérin  , and  isolated limb perfusion   are not recommended for adjuvant treatment of cutaneous melanoma except as part of a clinical trial."

">The role that  neuropsychological task performance  plays in the assessment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder ( ADHD )  is currently ambiguous , and findings are mixed regarding whether tasks have validity for diagnosing the disorder . Irrespective of their validity for diagnosing ADHD ,  neuropsychological tasks  could provide valuable information to mental health professionals if they can inform recommendations for treatment targets and modalities . Therefore , this review sought to synthesize the available evidence related to the use of  neuropsychological task performance  as a tool for informing treatment planning for  youth with ADHD .  Review ed studies focused on examinations of associations between  task performance  and  academic , social , and health outcomes  , as well as response to treatment .  Twenty-five relevant studies using sample s of youth diagnosed with ADHD in clinical , community , and school setting s were identified .  Review of the evidence suggests that   task performance   may be useful in identifying individuals  with ADHD  at risk for  academic impairment .  However , the evidence is less compelling for identifying youth at risk for impaired  social functioning  or  poor health outcomes .  The review also found that  task performance  is likely useful for predicting  response  to  treatment  with methylpheni date . Across studies , evidence indicated that interpreting task  performance  in an integrated manner , such as a  factor score  or  mean score  , was more consistently useful for predicting outcomes of interest than interpreting performance from a single task . Implication s for the use of tasks in ADHD assessment s are discussed , and future directions are outlined for further examining the clinical utility of task  performance ."

"sAim This meta- analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  botulinum toxin-A ( BTX-A )  for the treatment of  neuralgia .  Methods We search ed PubMed , EMBASE , and Cochrane data bases to identify r and  omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing  BTX-A treatment with saline  for  alleviating neuropathic pain .  Primary outcome measures were  pain scores  up to 24 weeks after treatment . Secondary outcomes were  hours of sleep , Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) life quality question naire , and adverse events .  We used Review Manager 5.3 for the data analyses . Results  Twelve RCTs were included ( n=495 ) .   Pain scores  in the  BTX-A  group were significantly lower compared to the  saline  group at 4 weeks ( mean difference [ MD ] = -1.64 , 95 % CI [ -3.21 , -0.07 ] , P=0.04 ) , 12 weeks ( MD = -1.49 , 95 % CI [ -2.05 , -0.93 ] , P<0.00001 ) , and 24 weeks ( MD = -1.61 , 95 % CI [ -2.81 , -0.40 ] , P=0.009 ) . There were no significant differences in  hours of sleep , SF-36 question naire , or the incidence of injection pain or hematoma  between the two groups . No  serious adverse events  associated with  BTX-A  were noted .  Fourteen out of 108 patients ( 12.9 % ) with trigeminal neuralgia  experienced  mild facial asymmetry  after the  BTX-A  treatment . Conclusion Based on the current evidence ,  BTX-A  may be an effective and safe option for the treatment of  neuralgia .  Due to the  limited number of patients included in  this  meta- analysis  , more trials are still needed to confirm these results."

"  Lithium  continues as the st and ard and most extensively evaluated treatment for  bipolar  disorder , especially for long-term prophylaxis."
" This review shows a beneficial  effect  of EWS in  time to recurrence , percentage of people hospitalised and functioning  in people with bipolar disorder . However , the absence of data on the primary outcome measure in so many included studies is a source of concern and a potential source of bias . Mental health services should consider routinely providing  EWS interventions  to adults with bipolar  disorder  , as they appear to  reduce hospitalisation  and therefore may be cost-effective."
"eObjectives Pulpotomy is the favored treatment for pulp exposure in  carious primary teeth .  This review aim ed to compare the success rates of  biodentine ( BD ) and mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA ) pulpotomies   in primary molars  using meta‐ analysis ( MA ) and trial sequential analysis ( TSA ) and also to assess the quality of the results by Grading  of Recommendations  , Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Methods PubMed , EBSCOhost , and Scopus data bases were search ed . Additional search ing was performed in clinical trial registry , reference lists of systematic review s , and textbooks .  R and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) published in the English language through October 2017  comparing the success of  pulpotomies in vital primary molars with a follow‐up of at least 6 months were  selected . Study selection , data extraction , and risk of bias assessment were performed . MA by r and om effects model , TSA , and GRADE were performed . Results  Eight RCTs ( n = 474 ) were included .  Two RCTs had low risk of bias . No significant difference was observed between MTA and BD  in clinical success  at 6 months ( risk ratio [ RR ] , 1.00 ; 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] , 0.97–1.02 ; I2 = 0 % ) , 12 months ( RR , 1.00 ; 95 % CI , 0.96–1.05 ; I2 = 0 % ) , and 18 months ( RR , 1.00 ; 95 % CI , 0.93–1.08 ; I2 = 0 % ) . No difference was  observed in radiographic success  at follow‐up of 6 months ( RR , 0.99 ; 95 % CI , 0.96–1.02 ; I2 = 0 % ) , 12 months ( RR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.47–2.21 ; I2 = 0 % ) , and 18 months ( RR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.91–1.15 ; I2 =  0 % )  . TSA indicated lack of firm evidence for the results of the meta‐analytic  outcomes on clinical and radiographic success  . GRADE assessed the evidence from the MA comparing the effect of MTA and BD in pulpotomy to be of low quality . Conclusion BD and MTA have similar  clinical and radiographic success rates  based on limited and low‐ quality evidence . Future high‐ quality RCTs between MTA and BD is required to confirm the evidence."
"yA longst and ing debate on health systems organization relates to benefits of integrating   health programmes  that emphasize specific interventions  into mainstream health systems to increase  access and  improve  health outcomes .  This debate has long been characterized by polarization of views and ideologies , with protagonists for and against integration arguing the relative merits of each approach . However , all too frequently these arguments have not been based on hard evidence . The presence of both  integrated  and  non-integrated programmes  in many countries suggests there may be benefits to either approach , but the relative merits of integration in various context s and for different interventions have not been systematic ally analysed and documented . In this paper we present findings of a systematic review that explores a broad range of evidence on : ( i ) the extent and nature of the integration of  targeted health programmes  that emphasize specific interventions into critical health systems functions , ( ii ) how the integration or non-integration of health programmes into critical health systems functions in different context s has influenced programme success , ( iii ) how context ual factors have affected the extent to which these programmes were integrated into critical health systems functions . Our analysis shows few instances where there is  full integration of a health intervention  or where an intervention is completely non-integrated . Instead , there exists a highly heterogeneous picture both for the nature and also for the extent of integration . Health systems combine both non-integrated and integrated interventions , but the balance of these interventions varies considerably."
">INTRODUCTION Although cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) prevention programmes have been effective in  urban residents  , their effectiveness in non-urban setting s , where cardio-metabolic risk is typically elevated , is unknown . We systematic ally review ed the effectiveness of  primary prevention programmes  aim ed at reducing risk factors for  CVD/T2DM  , including  blood pressure , body mass index ( BMI ) , blood lipid and glucose , diet , lifestyle  , and  knowledge  in  adults residing in non-urban areas .  METHODS  Twenty-five manuscripts , globally , from 1990 were selected for review ( seven included in the meta-analyses )  and classified according to : 1 ) study design ( r and omised controlled trial [ RCT ] or pre-/post-intervention ) ; 2 ) intervention duration ( short [ < 12months ] or long term [ ≥12months ] ) , and ; 3 ) programme type  ( community-based programmes or non-community-based programmes )  . RESULTS Multiple strategies within interventions focusing on health behaviour change  effectively reduced cardio-metabolic risk  in non-urban individuals . Pre-/post-test design studies showed more favourable improvements generally , while RCTs showed  greater improvements in physical activity and disease and risk knowledge  . Short-term programmes were more effective than long-term programmes and in pre-/post-test design s  reduced systolic blood pressure  by 4.02mmHg ( 95 % CI -6.25 to -1.79 ) versus 3.63mmHg ( 95 % CI -7.34 to 0.08 ) in long-term  programmes .  Community-based programmes achieved good  results  for  most risk factors except BMI and ( glycated haemoglobin ) HbA1c  .  The setting for applying cardio-metabolic prevention programmes is important given its likelihood to influence programme efficacy . Further investigation is needed to eluci date the individual determinants of cardio-metabolic risk in  non-urban population s  and in contrast to  urban population ."
">This study aim ed to identify factors that can affect the  retention of  glass fiber posts  to intra-radicular dentin  based on in vitro studies that compared the bond strength ( BS ) of  GFPs  cemented with resin cements .   Search es were carried out in PubMed and Scopus until December 2013 .  Bond strength values  and  variables  as type of tooth , presence of endodontic treatment , pretreatment of the post , type of  bonding agent  ( if present ) , type of cement and mode of cement application were extracted from the 34 included studies . A linear regression model was used to evaluate the influence of these parameters on  BS .  The presence of endodontic treatment  decreased the BS values  in 22.7 % considering the pooled data ( p = 0.013 ) . For regular cement , cleaning  the  post  increased BS  when compared to  silane application  without cleaning ( p = 0.032 ) , considering cleaning as ethanol , air abrasion , or phosphoric acid application . Applying the cement around the post and into root canal decreased the  resistance  compared to only around the post ( p = 0.02 ) or only into root canal ( p = 0.041 ) , on the other h and , no difference was found for self-adhesive resin cement for the same comparisons ( p = 0.858 and p = 0.067 ) .  Endodontic treatment , method of cement application , and post pretreatment  are factors that might significantly affect the retention of  glass-fiber  posts   into root canals mainly when cemented with regular resin cement .  Self-adhesive resin cements  were found to be less  technique-sensitive  to luting procedures as compared with regular  resin cements ."
"nAbstract Background :  Sit-st and workstations  are proposed solutions to reduce sedentary time at work . Numerous companies are using them to mitigate health concerns such as musculoskeletal discomfort . Objective : To review the literature on  sit-st and workstations  and low back discomfort . Method : We conducted a meta- analysis on literature published before  17 November 2016  that addressed the relationship between  sit-st and workstations  and musculoskeletal discomfort , focusing on the low back . Results :  Twelve articles were identified  and  eight  that presented results in means ( SD ) were included . Among a  pain-free population  , the st and ardised mean difference was −0.230 for low back discomfort with use  of sit-st  and workstations . When applying the SMD to studies using the  10-point pain scale  , the effect estimates ranged between −0.30 and −0.51 .  Conclusion : sit-st and workstations  may  reduce low back pain   among workers .  Further research is needed to help quantify dosage parameters and other health outcomes . Practitioner Summary : In a  sedentary population  , changing posture may reduce the chance of  developing low back pain  . The literature lacks studies on specific population s such as those  who have pre-existing low back pain  and also does not adequately address the dosage  of sit-st  and time required to help reduce pain."
" The evidence suggests the ongoing implementation of  school-based physical activity interventions  at this time , given the positive effects on behavior and one physical health status measure . However , given these studies are at a minimum of moderate risk of bias , and the magnitude of effect is generally small , these results should be interpreted cautiously . Additional research on the long-term impact of these interventions is needed."

"  Enteral supplementation of probiotics  prevents  severe NEC  and all cause  mortality  in  preterm infants .  Our up date d review of available evidence strongly supports a change in practice . Head to head comparative studies are required to assess the most effective preparations , timing , and length of therapy to be utilized . PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY  Probiotics  for prevention of  necrotizing enterocolitis  in  preterm infants  Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is a serious disease that affects the bowel of  premature infants in the first few weeks of life .  Although the cause of NEC is not entirely known , milk feeding and bacterial growth play a role .  Probiotics ( dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast )  have been used to prevent NEC . Our review of studies found that the use of  probiotics  reduces the  occurrence of NEC and death  in  premature infants born weighing less than 1500 grams .  There is insufficient data with regard to the  benefits  and potential  adverse effects  in the most at risk infants weighing less than 1000 grams at birth."

"yBackground  Anabolic and rogenic steroids ( AAS )  are testosterone derivatives used by  athletes  and recreational  users  to improve athletic performance and /or enhance appearance .  Anabolic and rogenic steroids  use may have serious and potentially irreversible adverse effects on different organs and systems , including the reproductive system . Objective This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to critically assess the impact of  AAS  use on the reproductive system of  athletes and recreational users .  Methods An electronic literature search was conducted using the data bases MEDLINE , CENTRAL , and Google Scholar . Studies were included when the following criteria were fulfilled :  participants were athletes or recreational users of any age , sex , level or type of sport ;  AAS  use of any type , dose , form or duration  ;  AAS  effects on the reproductive system were assessed as stated by medical history , clinical examination , hormone and /or semen analysis . R and om-effects meta- analysis was performed to assess the  weighted mean difference ( WMD ) of serum gonadotropin ( luteinizing hormone , follicle-stimulating hormone ) and testosterone levels  compared with baseline , during the period of  AAS  use , as well as following  AAS  discontinuation . Results  Thirty-three studies  ( three r and omized clinical trials , 11 cohort , 18 cross-sectional , and one non-r and omized parallel clinical trial  ) were included in the systematic review ( 3879 participants ; 1766  AAS  users and 2113 non-AAS users ) . The majority of the participants were men ; only six studies provided data for female athletes .  A meta- analysis ( 11 studies ) was conducted of studies evaluating  serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels  in  male  subjects : ( 1 ) prior to , and during  AAS  use ( six studies , n = 65 AAS users ; seven studies , n = 59 , evaluating  gonadotropin and testosterone levels  respectively ) ; ( 2 ) during  AAS  use and following  AAS  discontinuation ( four studies , n = 35 ; six studies , n = 39 , respectively ) ; as well as ( 3 ) prior to  AAS  use and following  AAS  discontinuation ( three studies , n = 17 ; five studies , n = 27 , respectively ) . During  AAS  intake , significant  reductions in luteinizing hormone  [ weighted mean difference ( WMD ) −3.37 IU/L , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) −5.05 to −1.70 , p < 0.001 ]  , follicle-stimulating hormone  ( WMD −1.73 IU/L , 95 % CI −2.67 to −0.79 , p < 0.001 )  , and endogenous testosterone levels  ( WMD −10.75 nmol/L , 95 % CI −15.01 to −6.49 , p < 0.001 ) were  reported  . Following  AAS   discontinuation , serum gonadotropin levels  gradually returned to baseline values within 13–24 weeks ,  whereas serum testosterone levels  remained lower as compared with baseline ( WMD −9.40 nmol/L , 95 % CI −14.38 to  −4.42 , p < 0.001 ) . Serum testosterone levels  remained reduced at 16 weeks following discontinuation of  AAS  . In addition ,  AAS  abuse result ed  in structural and functional sperm changes , a reduction in testicular volume , gynecomastia , as well as clitoromegaly , menstrual irregularities , and subfertility  . Conclusion The majority of   AAS  users  demonstrated  hypogonadism  with persistently  low gonadotropin and testosterone levels  , lasting for several weeks to months after  AAS  withdrawal .  Anabolic and rogenic steroid  use results in profound and prolonged effects on the reproductive system of athletes and recreational users and potentially on fertility."

">Introduction Hypoglycaemia is a clinical syndrome from various causes , which happens when the blood glucose concentration is too low . Many studies show that  telemedicine intervention  can improve  glycemic control  and has a positive impact on the  management  of  diabetic  patients .   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of  telemedicine intervention  on  hypoglycemic event  occurrences and results  on hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) and body mass index ( BMI ) .  Methods We search ed the Cochrane Library , PubMed , Web of Science , the EBSCO host , and OVID to identify relevant  studies published from January 2006 to December 2017 .  The work of search ing , selecting and assessing risk of bias was administrated by two independent review ers . The primary outcomes were  hypoglycemic event rate and HbA1c ;  the secondary outcome was  BMI .  Results  From 1246 articles , we identified 14 eligible RCTs ( n = 1324 ) .  Compared to usual  care , telemedicine  was found to reduce  the odds of hypoglycaemia  ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 0.42 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.29–0.59 ; I2 = 32 % ; p < 0.00001 ) . We found that the clinical relevance declined  in HbA1c level  compared to control group ( mean difference = −0.28 ; 95 % CI = −0.45 to −0.12 ; I2 = 53 % ; p = 0.0005 ) , but that telemedicine had no  effect on BMI  ( mean difference = −0.27 ; 95 % CI = −0.86–0.31 ; I2 = 40 % ; p = 0.35 ) . Discussion Compared to usual care , the use  of telemedicine  was found to  improve HbA1c  and  reduce the risk of moderate hypoglycaemia   in diabetic patients  , but without  significant difference in BMI ."

"%OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of targeting  intensive glycaemic control versus conventional glycaemic control  on   all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality  ,  non-fatal  myocardial infa  rct  ion , microvascular complications , and severe hypoglycaemia  in  patients with type 2 diabetes .  DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of r and omised trials . DATA SOURCES Cochrane Library , Medline , Embase , Science Citation Index Exp and ed , LILACS , and CINAHL to December 2010 ; h and search of reference lists and conference proceedings ; contacts with authors , relevant pharmaceutical companies , and the US Food and Drug Administration . STUDY SELECTION R and omised clinical trials comparing  targeted intensive glycaemic control with conventional glycaemic control  in  patients with type 2 diabetes .  Published and unpublished trials in all language s were included , irrespective of predefined outcomes . DATA EXTRACTION Two review ers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data related to study  methods , interventions , outcomes , risk of bias , and adverse events .  Risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were estimated with fixed and r and om effects models . RESULTS  Fourteen clinical trials that r and omised 28,614 participants with type 2 diabetes ( 15,269 to intensive control and 13,345 to conventional control )  were included . Intensive glycaemic control did not significantly affect the  relative risks of all cause  ( 1.02 , 95 % confidence interval 0.91 to 1.13 ; 28,359 participants , 12 trials ) or  cardiovascular mortality  ( 1.11 , 0.92 to 1.35 ; 28,359 participants , 12 trials ) . Trial sequential analyses rejected a  relative risk reduction  above 10 % for all  cause mortality  and showed insufficient data on  cardiovascular mortality .  The  risk of non-fatal myocardial infa rct ion  may be reduced ( relative risk 0.85 , 0.76 to 0.95 ; P=0.004 ; 28,111 participants , 8 trials ) , but this finding was not confirmed in trial sequential analysis . Intensive glycaemic control showed a reduction of the  relative risks for the composite microvascular outcome  ( 0.88 , 0.79 to 0.97 ; P=0.01 ; 25,600 participants , 3 trials ) and  retinopathy  ( 0.80 , 0.67 to 0.94 ; P=0.009 ; 10,793 participants , 7 trials ) , but trial sequential analyses showed that sufficient evidence had not yet been reached . The estimate of an effect on  the risk of nephropathy  ( relative risk 0.83 , 0.64 to 1.06 ; 27,769 participants , 8 trials ) was not statistically significant . The  risk of severe hypoglycaemia  was significantly increased when  intensive  glycaemic  control  was targeted ( relative risk 2.39 , 1.71 to 3.34 ; 27,844 participants , 9 trials ) ; trial sequential analysis supported a 30 % increased relative risk of severe hypoglycaemia .  Intensive glycaemic control does not seem to reduce  all cause mortality  in  patients with type 2 diabetes .  Data available from r and omised clinical trials remain insufficient to prove or refute a  relative risk reduction for cardiovascular mortality , non-fatal myocardial infa rct ion , composite microvascular complications , or retinopathy  at a magnitude of 10 % .  Intensive glycaemic control  increases the  relative risk of severe hypoglycaemia  by 30 %."

"DOBJECTIVE To assess the potential benefit of  digital health interventions ( DHIs )  on   cardiovascular disease ( CVD )  outcomes ( CVD events , all-cause mortality , hospitalizations ) and risk factors  compared with  non-DHIs .  PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a systematic search of PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science , Ovid , CINHAL , ERIC , PsychINFO , Cochrane , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  for articles published from January 1 , 1990 , through January 21 , 2014 .  Included studies examined any element of  DHI ( telemedicine , Web-based strategies , e-mail , mobile phones , mobile applications , text messaging , and monitoring sensors )  and CVD outcomes or risk factors . Two review ers independently evaluated study quality utilizing a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration risk assessment tool . Authors extracted  CVD outcomes  and  risk factors for  CVD such as  weight , body mass index , blood  pressure  , and lipid levels   from 51 full-text articles that met validity and inclusion criteria  . RESULTS  Digital health interventions  significantly reduced  CVD outcomes  ( relative risk , 0.61 ; 95 % CI , 0.46 - 0.80 ; P<.001 ; I(2)=22 % ) . Concomitant  reductions in weight  ( -2.77 lb [ 95 % CI , -4.49 to -1.05 lb ] ; P<.002 ; I(2)=97 % ) and  body mass index  ( -0.17 kg/m(2 ) [ 95 % CI , -0.32 kg/m(2 ) to -0.01 kg/m(2 ) ] ; P=.03 ; I(2)=97 % ) but not  blood pressure  ( -1.18 mm Hg [ 95 % CI , -2.93 mm Hg to 0.57 mm Hg ] ; P=.19 ; I(2)=100 % ) were found in these  DHI  trials compared with usual care . In the 6 studies reporting  Framingham risk score , 10-year risk percentages  were also significantly improved ( -1.24 % ; 95 % CI , -1.73 % to -0.76 % ; P<.001 ; I(2)=94 % ) . Results were limited by heterogeneity not fully explained by study population ( primary or secondary prevention ) or DHI modality .  Overall , these aggregations of data provide evidence that  DHIs  can reduce  CVD outcomes  and have a positive impact on risk factors for CVD."
"tThere is an increasing interest for using  telecare(TC )  in the management of  hypertension .  A systematic review to the use of  blood pressure ( BP ) measurement  in  TC  has been performed ( Medline / PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Library ) , selecting  r and omized clinical  trials that compared  TC with usual care ( UC )  for hypertension management ( treatment and /or coaching ) .  Nine r and omized clinical trials were selected ( n=2501 , 61.4±0.6 years , 42±2.7 % males ) .  Overall there was a significant larger decrease in  the TC  group than  in the UC group for systolic  ( 5.2±1.5 mmHg ;  P<0.001 ) and diastolic BP  ( 2.1±0.8 mmHg ; P<0.01 ) . When studies were separated for antihypertensive treatment modification during the study ( yes or  no ) , systolic BP decrease difference  between the  TC  and UC groups  (  ΔTC-ΔUC ) tended to be significantly lower ( 5.1±2.9 mmHg lower ) with treatment modification compared with nontreatment modification in which the ΔTC-ΔUC was 8.6±2.4 mmHg ,   P=0.07 . TC  led to a greater decrease in systolic and diastolic BP   than  UC . The  differences  between  TC  and UC  for systolic BP  tend to become larger when no treatment modification is applied  . TC  seems a valuable tool for hypertension management."
">The purpose of the study was to determine the  efficacy and safety  of  nonantimuscarinic treatments  for  overactive bladder .  Medline , Cochrane , and other data bases ( inception to April 2 , 2014 ) were used .  We included any study design in which there were 2 arms and an n > 100 , if at least 1 of the arms was a  nonantimuscarinic therapy  or any comparative trial , regardless of number  ,  if at least 2 arms were  nonantimuscarinic therapies  for overactive bladder . Eleven review ers double-screened citations  and extracted eligible studies for study : population , intervention , outcome , effects on outcome categories , and quality . The body of evidence for categories of interventions were summarized and assessed for strength .  Ninety-nine comparative studies met  inclusion  criteria  . Interventions effective to improve  subjective overactive bladder symptoms  include  exercise with heat and steam generating sheets  ( 1 study )  , diaphragmatic  ( 1 study )  , deep abdominal  ( 1 study ) , and  pelvic floor muscle training exercises  ( 2 studies ) .  Pelvic floor  exercises are more effective in subjective and objective outcomes with biofeedback or verbal feedback .   Weight  loss with diet and exercise  ,  caffeine reduction  , 25 - 50 % reduction in fluid intake , and  pelvic floor muscle exercises  with  verbal instruction  and or  biofeedback  were all efficacious .  Botulinum toxin A  improves  urge incontinence episodes , urgency , frequency , quality of life , nocturia , and urodynamic testing parameters .   Acupuncture   improves quality of life and urodynamic testing parameters .   Extracorporeal magnetic  stimulation  improves urodynamic parameters .  Mirabegron  improves daily incontinence episodes , nocturia , number of daily voids , and urine volume per void  , whereas solabegron  improves daily incontinence episodes .  Short-term posterior tibial  nerve  stimulation is more efficacious than  pelvic floor muscle training exercises  and  behavioral therapy  for improving  : urgency , urinary incontinence episodes , daily voids , volume per void , and overall quality of life .  Sacral neuromodulation is more efficacious than antimuscarinic treatment for subjective  improvement of overactive bladder and quality of life .  Transvaginal electrical stimulation demonstrates subjective improvement in  overactive bladder symptoms and urodynamic parameters .  Multiple therapies , including  physical therapy , behavioral therapy , botulinum toxin A , acupuncture , magnetic stimulation , mirabegron , posterior tibial nerve stimulation , sacral neuromodulation , and transvaginal electrical stimulation  , are efficacious in the treatment of overactive  bladder ."

The heterogeneity of lifestyle interventions precluded a meta- analysis . Results . Overall ,  20 studies were retained  , including six focusing on  obesity control  . Seven were conducted within trials and 13 using modeling techniques . T2D prevention by physical activity or diet or both  proved cost-effective  according to accepted thresholds , except for five inconclusive studies , three on diabetes prevention and two on obesity control . Most studies exhibited limitations in reporting results , primarily with regard to generalizability and justification of selected sensitivity parameters . Conclusion . This confirms that lifestyle interventions for the primary prevention of diabetes  are cost-effective .  Such interventions should be further promoted as sound investment in the fight against diabetes."
"sColorectal  cancer  surgery results in considerable  postoperative morbidity , mortality  and  reduced quality of life .  As many patients will undergo  additional (neo)adjuvant therapy  , it is imperative that each individual optimize their physical function . To eluci date the potential of exercise in patient optimization , we investigated the evidence for an  exercise program  before and after surgical treatment in  colorectal cancer patients .  A systematic review was conducted according to the Cochrane H and book for Systematic Review s of Interventions , the guidelines of the Physical Therapy Journal and the PRISMA guidelines . No literature pertaining to  exercise training  during preoperative neoadjuvant treatment was found .  Seven studies ,  investigating the effects of  regular exercise  during  adjuvant chemotherapy  for  patients with colorectal cancer or a mixed population  ,  were identified .  A small effect ( effect size ( ES ) 0.4 ) of  endurance/interval training and strength training  ( ES 0.4 ) was found in two studies conducted in  patients with colorectal and gastrointestinal cancer .  In five studies that included a mixed population of  cancer  patients ,  interval training  result ed in a large improvement ( ES 1.5 ; P≤.05 )  . Endurance training  alone was found  to increase both lower extremity strength and endurance capacity .  The  effects of strength training  in the lower extremity are  moderate  , whereas , in the upper extremity , the increase is  small  . There is limited evidence available on   exercise training   during treatment in  colorectal cancer patients .  One study concluded  exercise therapy  may be  beneficial  for  colorectal cancer patients  during adjuvant treatment . The possible advantages of training during neoadjuvant treatment may be explored by prehabilitation trials."
"kAlthough it is believed that  physical activity , sedentary , and dietary behavior  ( i.e. ,  energy balance-related behavior )  may decrease the  risk of  burn-out   , the association between both is currently not well understood . Therefore , the aim of this systematic review was to synthesize studies investigating the relationship between  energy  balance-related behavior   and   burn-out risk .   A systematic literature search was conducted in four data bases , result ing in  25 included studies ( ten experimental and 15 observational studies ) .  Nine out of ten experimental studies showed that  exercise programs  were effective in reducing  burn-out risk .  Fourteen out of fifteen observational studies found a negative association between  physical activity and burn-out risk  , whereas one study did not find a relation . Two of the 15 observational studies also showed that being  more sedentary  was associated with a  higher burn-out risk  , and two other studies found that a  healthier diet  was related to a  lower burn-out risk .  No experimental studies were found for the latter two behaviors . It can be concluded that  physical activity  may be effective in  reducing burn-out risk .  The few observational studies linking  sedentary and dietary behavior  with  burn-out risk  suggest that being more  sedentary  and  eating less healthy  are each associated with higher  burn-out risk .  More high- quality research is needed to unravel the causal relationship between these two behaviors and burn-out risk."
"  Breast-milk  should remain the feed of choice for all babies . In  infants with at least one first degree relative with atopy  ,  hydrolysed formula  for a minimum of 4 months combined with dietary restrictions and environment measures may reduce the  risk  of  developing asthma or wheeze  in the first year of life . There is insufficient evidence to suggest that  soya-based milk formula  has any benefit."
"tPURPOSE To up date the 2009 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on pharmacologic interventions for   breast cancer  (  BC  )   risk reduction  . METHODS A systematic review of r and omized controlled trials and meta-analyses published from  June 2007 through June 2012  was completed using MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration Library . Primary outcome of interest was  BC incidence ( invasive and noninvasive ) .  Secondary outcomes  included BC mortality , adverse events , and net health benefits .  Guideline recommendations were revised based on an Up date Committee 's review of the literature . RESULTS  Nineteen articles met the selection criteria .  Six chemoprevention agents were identified  : tamoxifen , raloxifene , arzoxifene , lasofoxifene , exemestane , and anastrozole .  RECOMMENDATIONS In  women at increased risk of BC age ≥ 35 years  ,  tamoxifen  ( 20 mg per day for 5 years ) should be discussed as an option to reduce  the risk of estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive BC .  In  postmenopausal women   , raloxifene  ( 60 mg per day for 5 years ) and  exemestane  ( 25 mg per day for 5 years ) should also be discussed as options  for BC risk reduction  . Those at increased BC risk are defined as individuals with a 5-year projected  absolute risk of BC  ≥ 1.66 % ( based on the National Cancer Institute BC Risk Assessment Tool or an equivalent measure ) or women diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ . Use  of other selective ER modulators  or  other aromatase inhibitors  to lower  BC risk  is not recommended outside of a clinical trial . Health care providers are encouraged to discuss the option of chemoprevention among women at increased BC risk . The discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent."
"sObjective This systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) was conducted to determine the effect of  alpha-lipoic acid ( ALA ) supplementation  on the  inflammatory markers  among  patients with metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) and related disorders .  Methods We search ed the following data bases until November 2017 : PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . Three review ers independently assessed study eligibility , extracted data , and evaluated risk of bias of included primary studies . Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran ’s Q test and I-square ( I2 ) statistic . Data were pooled by using the r and om-effect model and st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) was considered as the summary effect size . Results  Eighteen trials out of 912 potential citations were found to be eligible for  our  meta- analysis  . The findings indicated  that ALA supplementation  significantly  decreased C-reactive protein ( CRP )  ( SMD = − 1.52 ; 95 % CI , − 2.25 , − 0.80 ; P  < 0.001 ) , interlokin-6 ( IL-6 )  ( SMD = − 1.96 ; 95 % CI , − 2.60 , − 1.32 ; P <  0.001 )  ,  and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels  ( TNF-α ) ( SMD = − 2.62 ; 95 % CI , − 3.70 , − 1.55 ; P < 0.001 )  in patients diagnosed with metabolic diseases .  Conclusion In summary , the current meta- analysis demonstrated the promising  impact of ALA  administration on  decreasing inflammatory markers such as CRP , IL-6 and  TNF-α among  patients with MetS and  related disorders."
"sBackground Recent r and omized controlled trials indicated that  aripiprazole  was the effective treatment for  children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .  Objective This study systematic ally review ed the  efficacy , acceptability and tolerability  of  aripiprazole  in treatment of  ASD children and adolescents .  Data sources Electronic search of data bases including , Scopus , PubMed , CINAHL and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was performed in July 2017 . Methods The full-text versions of included trials were meticulously evaluated and extracted . The main efficacious outcomes consisted of  pooled mean change scores of the  st and ardized rating scales for ASD and the pooled response rate . Results  A total of 408 r and omized patients from eligible trials were included  for synthesizing in this meta- analysis . The  pooled mean change scores  in  aripiprazole-treated  group for the  Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Irritability , ABC-Hyperactivity/noncompliance , ABC-Inappropriate speech and ABC-Stereotypic behavior  were significantly greater than those of the placebo-treated group . Unfortunately , the significant difference between two groups was not found for  ABC-Lethargy/social withdrawal .  The  overall pooled response rate  of the  aripiprazole-treated  group was significantly higher than that of the placebo-treated group . The  pooled overall discontinuation rate  in aripiprazole-treated group was significantly better than that of placebo-treated group . The  pooled discontinuation rates  due  to adverse events  in aripiprazole-treated group significantly differed from the placebo-treated group ( RR [ 95 % CI ] of 1.43 [ 0.65 , 3.18 ] , I 2=0 % ) . Limitation A small number of studies were gathered in this review . Conclusion  Aripiprazole  has  efficacy  in the treatment of behavioral disturbances , including  irritability ,  hyperactivity/noncompliance , inappropriate speech and stereotypic behavior found in  ASD children and adolescents  ; however , it could not improve the  lethargy/social withdrawal  in such patients . The present evidence also indicates that it is  safe , acceptable and tolerable  in such treatment . As a small sample size , further well-defined and large sample size studies should be conducted to warrant those findings."
"eBackground For the optimal use of clinical guidelines in daily practice , mere distribution of guidelines and material s is not enough , and active implementation is needed . This review investigated the effectiveness of  multifaceted implementation strategies  compared to  minimal , single , or no implementation strategy  for the  implementation of non-specific low  back and /or neck  pain guidelines  in health care . Methods The following electronic data bases were search ed from  inception to June 1  ,  2015 :  MEDLINE , Embase , PsycInfo , the Cochrane Library , and CINAHL . The search strategy was restricted to low back pain , neck pain , and implementation research .  Studies were included  if  their  design  was  a  r and omized controlled trial  ,  reporting on patients ( age ≥18 years ) with non-specific low back pain or neck pain ( with or without radiating pain ) .  Trials were eligible if they  reported patient outcomes , measures of healthcare professional behaviour , and /or outcomes on healthcare level .  The primary outcome  was professional behaviour .  Guidelines that were evaluated in the studies had to be implemented in a healthcare setting . No language restrictions were applied , and studies had to be published full-text in peer- review ed journals , thus excluding abstract only publications , conference abstract s , and dissertation articles . Two research ers independently screened titles and abstract , extracted data from included studies , and performed risk of bias assessment s. Results After removal of duplicates , the search result ed in  4750 abstract  s to be  screened  . Of  43 full-text articles assessed for eligibility , 12 were included in this review  ,  reporting on 9 individual studies  , and separate  cost-effectiveness analyses  of  3  included studies . Implementation strategies varied between studies . Meta-analyses did not reveal any differences in effect between multifaceted strategies and controls . Conclusion This review showed that multifaceted strategies for the implementation  of neck  and  /or back pain guidelines  in health care do not significantly  improve professional behaviour outcomes  . No effects  on patient outcomes or cost  of care could be found . More research is necessary to determine whether multifaceted implementation strategies are conducted as planned and whether these strategies are effective in changing professional behaviour and thereby clinical practice."
"hSedentary   behaviour  ( SB )  is increasing in Western societies and some studies suggest a deleterious effect of SB on bone . The aim of this systematic review was to examine the association between   SB  and bone health in children , adolescents and young adults .  Electronic data bases ( PubMed , MEDLINE , PsycINFO and Science Citation Index ) were search ed for relevant articles up to January 9 , 2017 . Studies were included when results on bone health ( e.g. strength , mass and structure ) and either subjectively ( question naires ) or objective ly (  accelerometry )  measured SB were reported in  healthy participants ≤24 years .  Two review ers independently screened titles and abstract s for eligibility , rated method ological quality and extracted data .  Seventeen observational studies were included .  Several studies that used  DXA  or  quantitative ultrasound  suggested that  objective  ly  measured SB  was negatively  associated with lower extremity bone outcomes , such as femoral neck bone mineral density  . The magnitude of this negative association was small and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity . In contrast to the lower extremities , there was insufficient evidence for an association  of lumbar spine bone outcomes with  objective ly  measured SB  . In high- quality studies that used DXA , no association was observed  between objective ly measured SB and total body bone outcomes  . In studies using question naires , none of these relationships were observed . Well- design ed longitudinal studies , objective ly measuring SB , are needed to further unravel the effect of SB , physical activity and their interaction on bone health."

"rAtrial fibrillation ( AF ) is characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of  mechanical  function ( 1 ) . It is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia , and according to estimates , 12.1 million Americans will have AF by 2050 ( 2 ) .  Patients with AF  have increased risk for  embolic stroke , heart failure , and cognitive impairment ; reduced quality of life ;  and  higher overall mortality  ( 35 ) . Strokes related to AF have been characterized as more severe ( 6 , 7 ) and translate to a substantial economic burden , costing Medicare approximately $ 8 billion annually ( 8) .  Antithrombotic therapies  are the mainstays for preventing  thromboembolic events  in patients with AF .  Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists ( VKAs )  has long been the gold st and ard therapy for stroke prevention in these patients . However , the challenges of monitoring VKA therapy and the many associated food and drug interactions have fueled the development of novel therapeutic options . Currently , 4  direct-acting oral anticoagulants  ( DOACs ) are approved for stroke prevention in patients with  nonvalvular  AF : the thrombin inhibitor  dabigatran  and the  factor Xa  inhibitors  apixaban , rivaroxaban , and edoxaban .  In addition , procedural interventions , such as left atrial appendage ( LAA ) occlusion devices , are an alternative treatment for patients who are  at high  risk for  bleeding  while  receiving anticoagulation therapy .  Since 2009 , 4 large trials comparing DOACs with  warfarin  ( ROCKET AF  [ Rivaroxaban  Once Daily Oral  Direct Factor Xa  Inhibition Compared with  Vitamin K Antagonism  for  Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial  in Atrial Fibrillation ] , ARISTOTLE  [ Apixaban  for  Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation ]  , RE-LY [ R and omized Evaluation of  Long Term Anticoagulant Therapy  ] , and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 [ Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial FibrillationThrombolysis in Myocardial Infa rct ion 48 ] ) have been completed , creating  a combined sample size of more than 71000 participants ( 912 ) .  This systematic review up date s previous review s ( 13 ) and aims to compare the effectiveness of the available medical and procedural therapies in preventing  thromboembolic events and bleeding complications  in patients with AF . Methods The full report ( available at www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov ; PROSPERO protocol available at www.crd.york.ac.uk/ PROSPERO /display_record.php?ID = CRD42017069999 ) provides detailed information on the methods used in this systematic review . This review was commissioned by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) in partnership with the Evidence -based Practice Center Program of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) to explore the data and ongoing uncertainties regarding AF treatment . To inform the review , PCORI held 2 multi stakeholder workshops to discuss scoping and prioritizing key questions . On the basis of stakeholder feedback , an analytic framework was constructed ( Appendix Figure ) to further explore new evidence related to the key questions from the original report . Appendix Figure . Analytic framework . AF = atrial fibrillation ; DVT = deep  venous  thrombosis ; KQ = key question ; ICH = intracranial  hemorrhage  ; PE = pulmonary embolism ; TIA = transient ischemic attack . Data Sources and Search es Literature was identified by search ing  PubMed , EMBASE  ,  and the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s for English- language studies published between 1 January 2000 and 14 February 2018 .  All search es were guided by an experienced research librarian ( Supplement Table 1 ) . Supplement . Supplement Tables and Figures Study Selection All studies were screened on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Supplement Table 2 ) . We  included studies that enrolled at least 20 patients aged 18 years or older with nonvalvular AF who received anticoagulation , antiplatelet , or  procedural therapy .   All studies were required to have had an active comparator and to have assessed an outcome of interest . Two independent investigators review ed each title and abstract for potential relevance . Any abstract selected by 1 investigator was included in the full-text review . During the full-text review , 2 investigators independently review ed the manuscript text and determined whether to include or exclude the study . Conflicts were resolved by further review and discussion or by a third-party arbitrator . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Investigator pairs were formed on the basis of method ological and clinical experience to abstract data from the selected studies . One investigator abstract ed the data into previously created data abstract ion forms and table templates . The other investigator review ed the abstract ed data together with the original article to ensure accuracy and completeness . We evaluated each study for method ological  quality  using the  Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool  ( for r and omized controlled trials [ RCTs ] ) and the  Risk of Bias  in  Nonr  and omized Studies of Interventions tool ( for observational studies ) . Studies were assigned a rating of good , fair , or poor quality . Quality assessment was outcome specific , such that a given study that analyzed its primary outcome well but did an incomplete analysis of a secondary outcome could be assigned a different quality grade for each of the 2 outcomes . Data Synthesis and Analysis Key features of each study were review ed and summarized on the basis of a hierarchy of evidence , with the best available evidence as the focus of the synthesis . Treatments were grouped according to drug class to determine whether a quantitative synthesis was feasible . If at least  3 studies with similar interventions and population s  were available to compare a specified outcome , we used the R statistical package , version 3.1.2 ( The R Foundation ) , with the metafor meta- analysis library , version 1.9 - 7 , to synthesize the available evidence . We used the r and om-effects DerSimonianLaird estimator ( 14 ) to generate summary values . In addition , we used the KnappHartung approach ( 15 ) to adjust the SEs of the estimated coefficients . We explored heterogeneity using graphical displays and test statistics ( Q and I 2 statistics ) . For observational studies , we used adjusted results from the individual studies for pooled analyses . If an individual study included findings from more than 1 dosage of a specific drug , we chose the dosage most typically used in the United States . We considered the use of a network meta- analysis to synthesize findings from the observational studies , although because of the heterogeneity of population s , treatment dosages , treatment protocol s , outcome definitions , and study quality , we did not include such analyses in our review . We rated  strength of evidence ( SOE )  using the approach described in the AHRQ methods guide ( 16 , 17 ) . We grade d the SOE for each outcome individually ; thus , the SOE for 2 separate outcomes in a given study may have been scored differently . In brief , the approach requires assessment of 5 domains :  study limitations ; consistency ; directness ; precision ; and reporting bias , including publication bias , outcome reporting , and analysis reporting bias .  These domains were considered qualitatively , and a summary rating of high , moderate , low , or insufficient SOE was assigned after discussion by 2 review ers . For outcomes assessed by both RCTs and observational studies , we focused our SOE rating on the RCT findings and then increased or decreased it depending on whether findings from the observational studies were consistent or inconsistent with those from the RCTs . We assigned the greatest weight to findings from large RCTs . Role of the Funding Source This topic was nominated and funded by PCORI for systematic review s by an Evidence -based Practice Center in partnership with AHRQ .

"dPurpose To review published studies regarding the use , feasibility and psychometric performance of the  schedule for the evaluation of individual quality of life — direct weighting ( SEIQoL-DW )  in clinical research . Methods Systematic literature review . Studies using the   SEIQoL-DW  were included if they were published in English and employed a quantitative design  . A pre-defined checklist was used to analyse the reported results . Results  Thirty-nine relevant articles were identified .  The  SEIQoL-DW  has been included in studies relating to a variety of population s , including those who are  severely ill  . The results of  convergent and discriminant validity  support our hypotheses in which SEIQoL-DW was expected to correlate moderately to high  with measures of global QoL , life satisfaction and mental health  and weakly  with measures of functional status and health .  Conclusion The  SEIQoL-DW  appears to be a feasible and valid instrument . The lack of association between the Index score and health , functional status , demographic and clinical parameters may be explained by the instrument ’s focus on  global QoL  and by that of the idiographic measurement approach reflecting the capacity of a patient to value domains other than health in life , despite having health problems . Nevertheless , continued psychometric evaluation in  large population s  with a longitudinal design is recommended."

" There are few well-vali date d FND-specific outcome measures . Thus , at present , we recommend that existing outcome measures , known to be reliable , valid and responsive in FND or closely related population s , are used to capture key outcome domains . Increased consistency in outcome measurement will facilitate comparison of treatment effects across FND symptom types and treatment modalities . Future work needs to more rigorously vali date outcome measures used in this population."

Results from larger rigorously design ed studies applicable to all crying infants will help draw more definitive conclusions."
"sPurpose The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) is a commonly used outcome measure for  osteoarthritis  . There are different versions of the  WOMAC  (  Likert  ,  visual analogue  or  numeric scales  ) . A previous review of trials published before 2010 found poor reporting and inconsistency in how the WOMAC was used . This review explores whether these problems persist . Methods This systematic review included  r and omised trials of hip and /or knee osteoarthritis published in 2016 that used the  WOMAC .   Data were extracted on the version used , score range , analysis and results of the WOMAC , and whether these details were clearly reported . Results  This review included 62 trials and 41 reported the  WOMAC total score  .  The version used and item range for the  WOMAC total score  were unclear in 44 % ( n = 18/41 ) and 24 % ( n = 10/41 ) of trials , respectively . The smallest  total score range  was 0–10 ( calculated by averaging 24 items scored 0–10 ) ; the largest was 0–2400 ( calculated by summing 24 items scored 0–100 ) . All trials reported the statistical analysis methods but only 29 % reported the between-group mean difference and 95 % confidence interval . Conclusion Details on the use and scoring of the WOMAC were often not reported . We recommend that trials report the version of the WOMAC and the score range used . The between-group treatment effect and corresponding confidence interval should be reported . If all the items of the WOMAC are collected , the total score and individual subscale scores should be presented . Better reporting would facilitate the interpretation , comparison and synthesis of the WOMAC score in trials."
"dNon-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs )  are medications that are frequently used by athletes . There may also be some abuse of these substances , although it is unclear whether NSAIDs in fact enhance performance . We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the effect of  NSAIDs  on sport performance indices . We selected r and omized trials from the PubMed and Cochrane Library data bases investigating the effects of  NSAIDs  on sport performance .  Volunteers could be healthy adult men and women .  Any  NSAID  , administered by any route , taken prior to any type of exercise , and for any duration could be used . The control intervention could be a  placebo , an active substance ,  or  no intervention .  We included double-blind , single-blind , and open-label studies . The primary outcome was the  maximum performance in exercises  as defined in each study . The secondary outcomes were the  time until self-reported exhaustion and the self-reported pain .   Among 1631 records  , we retained thirteen parallel-group and ten crossover studies , totaling  366 and 148 subjects  , respectively . They were disparate regarding treatments , dose and duration , and the type of exercise . There was neither significant difference in the  maximum performance  between NSAIDs and control groups nor in the  time until exhaustion nor in self-perceived pain .  The existence of an  ergogenic effect  of NSAIDs on  sport performance indices  was unable to be concluded , since the level of evidence of the studies is low , the doses tested , and the exercises performed are very heterogeneous and far from those observed in real-life practice s. More studies are required."

"yThe purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature to determine the effect of bariatric surgery on various pharmacokinetic parameters of oral antibiotic absorption as well as overall patient outcomes . MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) were search ed up to February 2020 . Outcomes of interest included  change in pharmacokinetic parameters of oral  antibiotics   administered to  patients following bariatric surgery  , using variables such as  maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , time to reach maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) , area under the concentration-time curve ( AUC ) , clearance , and volume of distribution .  MINORS and Cochrane risk of bias tools were used to assess quality of evidence .  Ten studies with 100 patients assessing 8 oral antibiotics were included .  The  majority ( 77 % ) of patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , with fewer undergoing ventral b and ed gastroplasty ( VBG ) ( 14 % ) , jejunoileostomy ( 6 % ) , and jejunoileal bypass ( 3 % )  . Antibiotic classes investigated included  beta-lactams  ( 5 studies ) ,  fluoroquinolones  ( 2 studies ) ,  macrolides  ( 2 studies ) , and  oxazolidinones  ( 1 study ) . Heterogeneity between studies precluded meaningful pooling or meta- analysis of data . Overall risk of bias was fair . Patients given oral  beta-lactams  and  macrolides  warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and  linezolid  may not be affected . Several studies also showed decreased  absorption  following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in  patients  with obesity compared to non-obese controls . Clinicians should monitor patients on a case-by-case basis for signs of antibiotic  failure  or toxicity and reassess dosing accordingly."
"IMalrotation  of the femoral component  after  primary total knee arthroplasty ( TKA )  is one of the most important problems leading to  painful TKA requiring revision surgery .  A comprehensive systematic review of the literature was performed to present current evidence on how to optimally place the  femoral component  in TKA . Several l and marks and techniques for intraoperative determination of  femoral  component placement and examination of their reliability were analyzed .  2806 articles were identified and 21 met the inclusion criteria .  As there is no un question ed gold st and ard , numerous approaches are possible which come along with specific advantages and disadvantages . In addition , imaging modalities and measurements regarding  postoperative femoral component rotation  were also investigated .  Femoral component rotation measurements  on  three-dimensional ( 3D ) reconstructed computerised tomography ( CT )  images displayed  intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICC )  above 0.85 , significantly better than those performed in radiographics or two-dimensional ( 2D ) CT images . Thus ,  3D CT  images to accurately evaluate  the femoral prosthetic component rotation  are recommended , especially in unsatisfied patients after TKA . The EKA Femoral Rotation Focus Group has not identified a single best reference method to determine  femoral component rotation  , but surgeons mostly prefer the measured resection technique using at least two l and marks for cross-checking the rotation .

"sSubstance  use  disorders have significant personal , familial , and societal consequences . Despite the serious consequences of substance use , only a few therapies are effective in treating substance use disorders , thus highlighting a need for improved treatment practice s. Substance use treatment response depends on multiple factors such as genetic , biological , and social factors . It is essential that each component is represented in treatment plans . The dopaminergic system plays a critical role in the pharmacotherapy for addictions , and an underst and ing of the role of variation of genes involved in this system is essential for its success . This review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses Statement guidelines . A computerized literature search was conducted using PubMed and Scopus ( all data bases ) . Articles published up to April 2015 that examined the role of dopaminergic gene variation in the  pharmacotherapy  of  alcohol , opioid , and cocaine use disorders  were review ed . Search terms were dopamine , gene , polymorphism , substance abuse , treatment , and response . Polymorphisms of the DRD2 , ANKK1 , DAT1 , DBH , and DRD4 genes have been found to moderate the  effects of  pharmacotherapy   of alcohol , opioid , and cocaine use disorders . The integration of genetic information with clinical data will inform health professionals of the most efficacious pharmacotherapeutic intervention for substance use disorders . More studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings."
"sBecause of scientific fraud four trials have been excluded from the original Cochrane meta- analysis on formulas containing  hydrolyzed protein  for prevention of  allergy and food intolerance in infants .  Unlike the conclusions of the revised Cochrane review the export group set up by the Section on Paediatrics , European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology ( SP-EAACI ) do not find that the exclusion of the four trials dem and s a change of the previous recommendations regarding primary dietary prevention of allergic diseases . Ideally , recommendations on primary dietary prevention should be based only on the results of r and omized and quasi-r and omized trials ( selection criteria in the Cochrane review ) . However , regarding breastfeeding r and omization is unethical , Therefore , in the development of recommendations on dietary primary prevention , high- quality systematic review s of high- quality cohort studies should be included in the evidence base . The study type combined with assessment of the method ological quality determines the level of evidence . In view of some method ological concerns in the Cochrane meta- analysis , particularly regarding definitions and diagnostic criteria for outcome measures and inclusion of non peer- review ed studies /reports , a revision of the Cochrane analysis may seem warranted . Based on analysis of published peer- review ed observational and interventional studies the results still indicate that breastfeeding is highly recommended for all  infants  irrespective of atopic heredity . A  dietary regimen  is effective in the  prevention of allergic diseases  in high-risk  infants  , particularly in early infancy regarding food allergy and eczema . The most effective dietary regimen is  exclusively breastfeeding  for at least 4 - 6 months or , in absence of breast milk , formulas with documented reduced  allergenicity  for at least the first 4 months , combined with avoidance of solid food and cow 's milk for the first 4 months."

"sThe burden of disabling musculoskeletal pain and injuries (  musculoskeletal disorders  ,  MSDs  ) arising from work-related causes in many workplaces remains substantial . There is little consensus on the most appropriate interventions for MSDs . Our objective was to up date a systematic review of  workplace-based interventions  for preventing and managing   upper extremity MSD ( UEMSD )  .  We followed a systematic review process developed by the Institute for Work & Health and an adapted best evidence synthesis . 6 electronic data bases were search ed ( January 2008 until April 2013  inclusive )  yielding  9909 non-duplicate references .  26 high- quality and medium- quality studies relevant to our research question were combined with 35 from the original review to synthesis e the evidence on 30 different intervention categories . There was strong evidence for one intervention category ,  resistance training  , leading to the recommendation : Implementing a  workplace-based resistance training exercise programme  can help prevent and manage  UEMSD and symptoms .  The synthesis also revealed moderate evidence for  stretching programmes , mouse use feedback  and  forearm supports  in  preventing UEMSD or symptoms .  There was also moderate evidence for  no benefit  for  EMG biofeedback , job stress management training , and office workstation adjustment for UEMSD and symptoms .  Messages are proposed for both these and other intervention categories."

"  Using  de-escalation techniques   for people  with  psychosis induced  aggression  or  agitation  appears to be accepted as good clinical practice but is not supported by evidence from r and omised trials . It is unclear why it has remained such an under- research ed area . Conducting trials in this area could be influenced by funding flow , ethical concerns - justified or not - anticipated pace of recruitment as well the difficulty in accurately quantifying the effects of de-escalation itself . With supportive funders and ethics committees , imaginative trialists , clinicians and service-user groups and wide collaboration this dearth of r and omised research could be addressed."
"lThe objective of this systematic review was to determine the influence of  surface treatment of  glass fiber posts   on  bond strength  to  dentine .  Laboratory studies were search ed in MEDLINE , PubMed , Embase , PubMed Central , Scopus , and Web of Science search engine . All authors interdependently screened all identified articles for eligibility . The included studies were assessed for bias . Because of the considerable heterogeneity of the studies , a meta- analysis was not possible .  Twelve articles were found eligible and included in the review  . An assessment of the  risk of  bias in the included studies provided a result that classified the studies as low , medium , and high risk of bias . The available evidence indicated that the coronal region of the  root  canal  bonded better to the  glass fiber post   than apical regions .  Phosphoric acid , hydrogen peroxide  , and  silane  application enhance  post ’s retentiveness .  In light of the current evidence , surface treatment strategies increase the  bond strength of glass fiber post to dentine  . However , recommendations for st and ardized testing methods and reporting of future clinical studies are required to maintain clinical ly relevant information and to underst and the effects of various surface treatment of  glass fiber  post   and their  bond strength  with dentine walls of the root canal."

"mWith onset often occurring  before 6 years of age  , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) involves attention problems , impulsivity , overactivity , and sometimes disruptive behavior . Impairment usually persists into adulthood , with an estimated worldwide prevalence in adults of 2.5 % . Existing gaps in evidence concerning ADHD hinder decision-making about treatment . This article describes and prioritizes future research needs for ADHD in three areas : treatment effectiveness for  at-risk preschoolers  ; long-term treatment effectiveness ; and variability in prevalence , diagnosis , and treatment . Using a recent systematic review concerning ADHD completed by a different evidence -based practice center as a foundation , we worked with a diverse group of  12  stakeholders , who represented research ers , funders , healthcare providers , patients , and families , to identify and prioritize research needs . From an initial list of 29 evidence gaps , we enumerated 8 high-priority research needs : a ) accurate , brief st and ardized diagnosis and  assessment ;  b ) comparative  effectiveness and safety  of  pharmacologic treatments  for children under 6 years of age ; c ) comparative  effectiveness  of different combinations  of psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments  for children under 6 years of age ; d ) case identification and  measurement of prevalence and outcomes ;  e  ) comparative effectiveness of  psychosocial treatment alone versus pharmacologic and combination treatments   for children under 6 years of age ; f )  comparative long-term treatment effectiveness  for people 6 years of age and  older ;  g  ) relative efficacy of specific psychosocial program components  for children under 6 years of age ; and h ) identification of  person-level effect modifiers  for people 6 years of age and older . In this article , we describe these future research needs in detail and discuss study design s that could be used to address them."

"  Financial incentives  may have potential to promote increased coverage of several important child health interventions , but the quality of evidence available is low . The more pronounced effects seem to be achieved by programs that directly removed user fees for access to health services . Some indication of effect were also observed for programs that  conditioned financial incentives  on participation in health education and attendance to health care visits . This finding suggest that the measured effect may be less a consequence of the  financial incentive  and more due to conditionalities addressing important informational barriers."
">OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review of the antihypertensive activity of the  angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonists  (  ARB ) .  METHODS Studies in which  blood  pressure ( BP )   was measured using ambulatory BP monitoring for at least 24 h were collected from MEDLINE . Data for each treatment group ,  ARB , placebo  or the drug used for its comparison were obtained from the selected studies . Only studies with a minimum of quality criteria were selected . The  final study group contained 36 publications , with a total of 47 patient cohorts receiving  ARB  in monotherapy , 10 with  placebo  , 10 with  amlodipine  , and five with  enalapril .   The  reduction in clinical and ambulatory BP during  24 h , day , night and the last 4-h period for each of the drugs analysed were calculated and adjusted by age , sex , number of participants and by the initial BP level . RESULTS The  global antihypertensive activity  of  ARB  differs from that observed with  amlodipine  in the sense that the magnitude of the  reduction in the BP values  does not essentially depend on the initial BP values nor on the dose used . When only  ARB  were considered , the drug used was a determinant for  systolic BP reduction  , whereas for  diastolic BP  the influence was on the  BP reduction  and the  duration of the antihypertensive activity .  The dose used had a particular influence on the  duration  of  the antihypertensive activity  for both  systolic and diastolic BP .   Among the  ARB  , the influence is on  duration  more than on the magnitude of  BP reduction .  Dose , therefore , is an important factor in the duration of  antihypertensive activity ."
"sBackground The consequences of lifestyle-related disease represent a major burden for the individual as well as for society at large . Individual  preventive health checks  to the general population have been suggested as a mean to reduce the burden of lifestyle-related diseases , though with mixed evidence on effectiveness . Several systematic review s , on the other h and , suggest that  health checks  targeting  people at high risk of chronic lifestyle-related diseases  may be more effective . The evidence is however very limited . To effectively target  people at high risk of lifestyle-related disease  , there is a substantial need to advance and implement evidence -based health strategies and interventions that facilitate the identification and management of people at high risk . This paper reports on a non-r and omized pilot study carried out to test the  acceptability , feasibility and short-term effects  of a  healthcare intervention  in primary care design ed to systematic ally identify  persons at risk of developing lifestyle-related disease or who engage in health-risk behavior  , and provide targeted and coherent preventive services to these individuals . Methods The intervention took place over a  three-month  period  from September 2016 to December 2016 .  Taking a two-pronged approach , the design included both a joint and a  targeted intervention  . The former was directed at the entire population , while the latter specifically focused on  patients at high risk of a lifestyle-related disease and /or who engage in health-risk behavior .  The  intervention was facilitated by a digital support system .  The evaluation of the pilot will comprise both quantitative and qualitative research methods . All outcome measures are based on vali date d instruments and aim to provide  results pertaining to intervention acceptability , feasibility , and short-term effects .  Discussion This pilot study will provide a solid empirical base from which to plan and implement a full-scale r and omized study with the central aim of determining the efficacy of a preventive health intervention .

">Background The effects of increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on  cardiovascular outcomes  remain uncertain . Design We conducted a meta- analysis to investigate the effects of  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifiers ( niacin , fibrates and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors )  on  cardiovascular outcomes  . Methods  Thirty-one r and omized controlled trials ( 154,601 patients ) with a follow-up of 6 months or more and a sample size of 100 or more patients were selected  using MEDLINE , EMBASE and CENTRAL data base ( inception January 2018 ) . Results High-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifiers had no statistically significant effect  on cardiovascular mortality  in terms of  relative risk  ( RR ) ( RR 0.94 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.89–1.00 , P = 0.05 , I2 = 13 % ) or absolute risk ( risk difference −0.0001 , 95 % CI −0.0014 , 0.0011 , P = 0.84 , I2 = 28 % ) . High-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifiers reduced  the RR of myocardial infa rct  ion ( RR 0.87 , 95 % CI 0.82–0.93 , P < 0.001 , I2 = 37 % ) . This significant effect was derived by the use of fibrates ( RR 0.80 , 95 % CI 0.73–0.87 , P < 0.001 , I2 = 22 % ) and meta-regression analysis showed that this benefit was consistent with an absolute  reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol .  High-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifiers had no effect  on stroke  ( RR 1.00 , 95 % CI 0.93–1.09 , P = 0.94 , I2 = 25 % )  or all-cause mortality  ( RR 1.02 , 95 % CI 0.97–1.08 , P = 0.48 , I2 = 49 % ) . Meta-regression analyses failed to demonstrate a significant association of pharmacologically  increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  with key endpoints . In studies with background  statin  therapy , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifiers had no statistically significant impact  on cardiovascular mortality , myocardial infa rct ion , stroke or all-cause mortality  ( P > 0.05 ) . Conclusion The use of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol modifying treatments had no significant effect  on cardiovascular mortality , stroke or all-cause mortality  . The beneficial effect on myocardial infa rct ion was lost when drugs were  used with statin therapy ."

"eBackground and purpose The aim of  short-stem total  hip  arthroplasty  is to preserve proximal bone stock for future revisions , to improve biomechanical reconstruction , and to make minimally invasive approaches easier . It is therefore being increasingly considered to be a sound alternative to conventional total hip arthroplasty , especially for  young and active patients .  However , it is still unknown whether survival rates of  short-stem   hips  match current st and ards . We made a systematic summary of reported overall survival after  short-stem total hip arthroplasty .  Material s and methods We conducted a systematic review  of English , French , German , and Dutch literature .  2 assessors independently identified  clinical studies on  short-stem hip arthroplasty .   After recalculating reported revision rates , we determined whether each implant had a projected revision rate of 10 % or less at 10 years of follow-up or a revision rate per 100 observed component years of 1 or less . Stems were classified as  “ collum ”  ,  “ partial collum  ” , or  “ trochanter-sparing  ” . Results and Interpretation We found  49 studies , or 51 cohorts , involving 19 different stems .  There was a large increase in recent publications . The majority of studies included had a follow-up of less than 5 years . We found a large number of observational studies on “ partial collum ” and “ trochanter-sparing ” stems , demonstrating adequate  survival rates  at medium-term follow-up . Clinical evidence from  “ collum stem ”  studies was limited to a small number of studies with a medium-term follow-up period . These studies did not show a satisfactory overall survival rate."
"dBACKGROUND  Cinnamon  is a rich botanical source of polyphenols , whose positive effects on  blood lipid concentrations  have been hypothesized , but have not been conclusively studied . OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to systematic ally review and evaluate the effect of administration of  cinnamon  on  blood lipid concentrations .  METHODS We assessed  13 r and omized controlled trials with 750 participants investigating the effect of  cinnamon supplementation  on  blood lipid concentrations .   A meta- analysis was performed using r and om effect models , with weighted mean differences ( WMDs ; with 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) for endpoints calculated using a r and om effects model . RESULTS No statistically significant effect of  cinnamon  was observed on  blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( LDL-C ; WMD : -0.16 mmol/L [ -6.19 mg/dL ] , 95 % CI : -0.35 , 0.03 [ -13.53 , 1.16 ] , P = .10 ) and  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( HDL-C ; WMD : 0.05 mmol/L [ 1.92 mg/dL ] , 95 % CI : -0.03 , 0.12 [ -0.03 , 4.64 ] , P = .21 ) concentrations . However , a statistically significant reduction in  blood triglycerides  ( WMD : -0.27 mmol/L [ -23.91 mg/dL ] , 95 % CI : -0.39 , -0.14 [ -34.54 , -12.40 ] , P < .01 ) and  total cholesterol concentrations  ( WMD : -0.36 mmol/L [ -13.92 mg/dL ] , 95 % CI : -0.63 , -0.09 [ -24.36 , -3.48 ] , P < .01 ) was observed .  HDL-C  was significantly elevated after the omission of 1 study ( WMD : 0.04 mmol/L [ 1.54 mg/dL ] , 95 % CI : 0.03 , 0.06 [ 1.16 , 2.32 ] , P < .01 ) during our sensitivity analysis . A meta-regression analysis was conducted , and no significant association was found between changes in  lipid parameters  and  cinnamon  dose .

"rDear Editor , In their recent paper entitled ‘  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors versus placebo  in  patients with major depressive  disorder  .  A systematic review with meta- analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis ’ ( 1 ) , Jakobsen et al. conclude that ‘ The observed harmful effects seem to outweigh the potential small beneficial clinical effects of SSRIs , if they exist ’ ( 1 ) . In a follow-up article in a Danish popular science journal ( Videnskab.dk ) , Jakobsen is quoted for the following statement on the  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs )  ( freely translated from Danish ) : ‘ We are dealing with medicine that affects important neurotransmitters in the brain and has severe side effects . To justify giving this to people , we have to be sure that it works against depression . But it does n’t ’ ( 2 ) . This message was broadly disseminated via the Danish news media in the days following the publication of the meta- analysis . It is very important to communicate research findings to the general public . However , when making as blunt a statement as the one outlined above , which is likely to affect both the opinion and behaviour of individuals ( for instance , the adherence to SSRI treatment or the likelihood of accepting SSRI treatment when indicated ) , research ers are ethically obliged to ensure that their interpretation of their results is completely unchallengeable . Below , I will make the argument that the interpretation made by Jakobsen et al. is far from unchallengeable , and that the statements in the paragraph above are therefore highly question able . Jakobsen et al. have performed a very extensive systematic search of both published and unpublished results of r and omised clinical trials ( RCTs ) comparing the effect of  SSRIs  with that of  placebo  ( 1 ) . They are to be complimented for that effort . Most of the RCTs included in the meta- analysis used the  total score on the 17-item or the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) (  3 ) as the outcome measure , and the primary results in the article by Jakobsen et al. ( 1 ) therefore also refer to the HDRS . The results of their meta-analyses ‘ showed that SSRIs versus placebo  significantly reduced the HDRS score  ( mean difference −1.94 points ; 95 % CI −2.50 to −1.37 ; p<0.00001 ) ’ ( 1 ) . Jakobsen et al. consider this ‘ numerical ’ superiority of the SSRIs over placebo on  the HDRS  to be below the threshold for clinical significance ( 3 points on the HDRS ) , which was suggested by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) from the United Kingdom . Thus , the difference between 1.94 and 3 is essentially what leads Jakobsen et al. to the conclusion that there are only ‘ small  beneficial clinical effects  of  SSRIs  , if they exist ’ ( 1 ) . The rationale for this conclusion may seem bulletproof , but there is a fundamental problem with the  HDRS  as outcome measure , which Jakobsen et al. do not take into consideration . The HDRS was developed in 1960 ( 3 ) and consists of 17  symptom  items in the original version ( the 21-item version was never intended to be used for severity measurement in depression according to the scale ’s developer Max Hamilton ( 4 ) ) . In the RCTs included in the meta- analysis by Jakobsen et al. , the total score of these items is used as a measure for the  overall severity of depression  – and reduction in the  HDRS total score  over time is used as a measure of clinical improvement . In order for the total score to actually contain this clinical information , the HDRS must meet two fundamental criteria : ( I ) the total score of the items must correlate with evaluations of  depressive severity  made by clinical experts ( gold st and ard ) , and ( II ) each of the items must convey unique information regarding the severity of the latent syndrome being measured , that is , depression ( this is commonly referred to as ‘ unidimensionality ’ or ‘ scalability ’ ( 5 ) ) . In two l and mark studies from 1975 ( 6 ) and 1981 ( 7 ) , respectively , Bech et al. demonstrated that the original HDRS met none of these two criteria . This lack of  psychometric validity  of the HDRS has been confirmed in a large number of studies since then ( 8–15 ) . Therefore , the total score of the HDRS can not be considered as a clinical  ly valid measure of the severity of depression  ( 5,16 ) . As the conclusions made by Jakobsen et al. ( 1 ) are based on the results of analyses of HDRS total scores , it entails that they are not clinical ly valid either."

"sBackground The aging process is associated with a progressive decline of neuromuscular function , increased risk of falls and fractures , impaired functional performance , and loss of independence  . Plyometric training  may mitigate or even reverse such age-related deterioration ; however , little research on the effects  of plyometric exercises  has been performed in older adults . Objective The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the  safety and efficacy  of  plyometric training  in  older adults .  Methods Papers reporting on r and omized trials  of  plyometric training  in older adults ( ≥ 60 years ) and published up to December 2017  were sought in the PubMed , SPORTD iscus , Scopus , and EMBASE data bases , and their method ological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) scale . A narrative synthesis of the findings is presented in this systematic review . Results Of the  2236 identified papers , 18 were included in the review  , reporting on 12 different studies with a mean PEDro score of 6.0 ( range 4–7 ) .  Altogether , 289 subjects ( 176 females and 113 males ) were included in 15 intervention groups  with plyometric   components ( n = 8–36 per group )  ; their mean age ranged from 58.4 to 79.4 years  .  The plyometric training  lasted from 4 weeks to  12 months . Muscular strength , bone health , body composition , postural stability , and jump and physical performance  were the most often reported outcomes . No study  reported increased occurrence of injuries or other adverse  events  related to plyometric exercises  .  Conclusion Plyometric training  is a  feasible and  safe training option with potential for  improving various performance , functional , and health-related outcomes  in older persons."
"  Reserpine  is effective in reducing  SBP  roughly to the same degree as other first-line antihypertensive drugs . However , we could not make definite conclusions regarding the dose-response pattern because of the small number of included trials . More RCTs are needed to assess the effects of  reserpine  on  blood pressure  and to determine the dose-related safety profile before the role of this drug in the treatment of primary hypertension can be established."
"sBackground The measurement properties of instruments used to assess functional  capacity  , physical activity and muscle strength in  participants with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC )  have not been systematic ally review ed . Method Objectives : To identify outcome measures used to assess these outcomes in  participants with NSCLC ;  and to evaluate , synthesis e and compare the measurement properties of the outcome measures identified . Data Sources : A systematic review of articles using electronic data bases  MEDLINE ( 1950–2012 )  , CINAHL  ( 1982–2012 )  , EMBASE  ( 1980–2012 )  ,  Cochrane Library ( 2012 )  , Exp and ed Academic ASAP ( 1994–2012 ) , Health Collection Informit ( 1995–2012 ) and PEDRO ( 1999–2012 ) . Additional studies were identified by search ing personal files and cross referencing . Eligibility Criteria for Study Selection : Search one : studies which assessed functional capacity , physical activity or muscle strength in  participants with NSCLC using non-laboratory objective tests  were included . Search two : studies which evaluated a measurement property ( inter- or intra-rater reliability ; measurement error ; criterion or construct validity ; or responsiveness ) in NSCLC for one of the outcome measures identified in search one .  Studies published in English from 1980 were  eligible . Data Extraction and Method ological Quality Assessment : data collection form was developed and data extracted . Method ological quality of studies was assessed by two independent review ers using the 4-point COSMIN checklist . Results Thirteen outcome measures were identified .  Thirty-one  studies evaluating measurement properties of the outcome measures in  participants with NSCLC  were included .  Functional capacity  was assessed using the  six- and twelve-minute walk tests ; incremental- and endurance-shuttle walk tests ;  and the  stair-climbing test . Criterion validity  for three of these measures was established in NSCLC but not the reliability or responsiveness .  Physical activity  was measured using  accelerometers and pedometers .  Only the construct validity for  accelerometers  and  pedometers  was reported .  Muscle strength  was measured using h and -held dynamometry , h and  -grip dynamometry , manual muscle test , one-repetition maximum and the chair-st  and test , however only two studies reported  reliability and measurement error  and one study reported  construct validity  . Conclusion Currently there is a gap in the literature regarding the measurement properties of commonly used outcome measures in NSCLC participants , particularly reliability , measurement error and responsiveness . Further research needs to be conducted to determine the most suitable outcome measures for use in trials involving NSCLC participants."

"mObjectives The aim of this review was to assess the effect of different  adhesive systems  and tooth preparation on the retention of  tooth-colored  restorative  material s   placed in non-carious cervical lesions ( NCCLs ) .  Methods  R and omized  clinical trials with a minimum of 3 years of follow-up that evaluated the effectiveness of  tooth-colored material s , adhesive systems , and preparation techniques  for the restoration of  NCCLs  were selected . The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , EMBASE ( OVID ) , the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature data base ( LILACS ) , and Medline ( OVID ) electronic data bases were search ed from 1990 to 2013 . Results  Twenty-seven r and omized clinical trials were included  and review ed . Meta- analysis was used to determine the  relative risk of loss of tooth-colored  NCCL restorations   between different categories of adhesive systems . The  effect of tooth preparation  could not be similarly analyzed . Conclusion The current best evidence indicates that a  glass ionomer cement  has a significantly lower  risk of loss of  a  NCCL  restoration compared to either a three-step  etch- and -rinse  or a  two-step etch- and -rinse adhesive system ;  a  three-step etch- and -rinse adhesive system  has a significantly lower  risk of loss  of a  NCCL  restoration compared to a two-step  etch- and -rinse adhesive system .  No significant difference could be observed in the  risk of loss of a tooth-colored NCCL restoration  between a  three-step etch- and -rinse adhesive system  and either a  two-step self-etch  or a one-step self-etch adhesive system."

"sControversy exists among trials assessing whether  prolonged antioxidant vitamin supplementation  improves  endothelial function  in  type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) subjects .  The aim of this study was to systematic ally review and quantify the effect of  antioxidant vitamin supplementation  on endothelial function in  T2DM subjects .  MEDLINE , Cochrane , Scopus and Web of Science were search ed up to February 2013 for  r and omized  controlled trials assessing the effect of  antioxidant vitamin E and /or C supplementation  on  endothelial function in T2DM subjects . Ten r and omized controlled trials comparing  antioxidant vitamin-supplemented and control groups  ( overall n = 296 ) met the  inclusion criteria . Post-intervention  st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) in endothelial function  did not reach statistical significance between groups ( 0.35 ; 95 % confidence interval = -0.17 , 0.88 ; P = 0.18 ) . In subgroup analysis  , post-intervention endothelial function  was significantly improved  by antioxidant vitamin supplementation  in T2DM  subgroups  with body mass index ( BMI ) ≤ 29.45 kg m(-2 ) ( SMD = 1.02 ; P < 0.05 ) , but not in  T2DM subgroups  with BMI > 29.45 kg m(-2 ) ( SMD = -0.07 ; P = 0.70 ) . In meta-regression , an inverse association was found  between BMI and post-intervention SMD in endothelial function  ( B = -0.024 , P = 0.02  ) . Prolonged antioxidant vitamin E and /or C supplementation  could be effective  to improve endothelial function  in non-obese T2DM subjects."
"tModafinil is an FDA -approved eugeroic that directly increases cortical catecholamine levels , indirectly upregulates cerebral serotonin , glutamate , orexin , and histamine levels , and indirectly decreases cerebral gamma-amino-butrytic acid levels . In addition to its approved use treating excessive somnolence ,  modafinil  is thought to be used widely off-prescription for cognitive enhancement . However , despite this popularity , there has been little consensus on the extent and nature of the cognitive effects of modafinil in  healthy , non-sleep-deprived humans .  This problem is compounded by method ological discrepancies within the literature , and reliance on psychometric tests design ed to detect cognitive effects in ill rather than healthy population s. In order to provide an up-to- date systematic evaluation that addresses these concerns , we search ed MEDLINE with the terms  "" modafinil ""  and  ""  cognitive  ""  , and review ed all result ant  primary studies in English from January 1990 until December 2014  investigating the cognitive actions of modafinil  in healthy non-sleep-deprived humans .  We found that whilst most studies employing basic testing paradigms show that modafinil intake enhances  executive function  , only half show improvements in  attention and learning and memory  , and a few even report impairments in  divergent creative thinking .  In contrast , when more complex assessment s are used , modafinil appears to consistently engender enhancement of  attention , executive functions , and learning .  Importantly , we did not observe any preponderances for  side effects or mood changes .  Finally , in light of the method ological discrepancies encountered within this literature , we conclude with a series of recommendations on how to optimally detect valid , robust , and consistent effects in healthy population s that should aid future assessment of neuroenhancement."

"nPublished studies have reported widely divergent estimates of the prevalence of  chronic pain  among  individuals with ( traumatic ) spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .  To develop an estimate based on a synthesis of the research , we used search es of MEDLINE , CINAHL , PsycINFO , and other bibliographic data bases and an ancestor search to identify  articles published since 1966 in any language that reported a pain prevalence rate for at least 30 subjects with certain or likely traumatic SCI .  Data on  sample  makeup  , study quality indicators , and pain prevalence  were abstract ed independently by two research ers . A total of  42 studies reported  pain prevalence rates   that ranged from 26 % to 96 % , with a fairly even spread between these extremes . The reported rate did not appear to be related to study quality .  Pain prevalence  in the combined sample s did not appreciably differ between  males and females  ,  those with complete versus incomplete SCI  , and  those with paraplegia versus tetraplegia .  We conclude that too much heterogeneity was present in the reports to calculate a post-SCI  pain prevalence rate  using meta-analytic methods . Further research is needed to determine whether rates are related to sample makeup ( e.g. , average subject age ) , research methods used ( e.g. , telephone interview vs self-report instruments ) , or even the definition of ""  chronic  "" pain."
"yAim of the study  Probiotic  administration  to preterm infants  has the potential to prevent  necrotising  enterocolitis ( NEC )  .  Data from r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) are conflicting but meta-analyses seem to support this intervention . To date , these analyses have not focused on surgical NEC . We aim ed to determine the effect of  probiotic administration   to preterm infants  on prevention of  surgical NEC .  Methods A systematic review of RCTs of   probiotic administration  to preterm infants  was performed . Studies were included if RCT outcomes included any of ( 1 )  Bell ’s stage 3 NEC ;  ( 2 )  surgery for NEC ;  and ( 3 )  deaths attributable  to  NEC .  Article selection and data extraction were performed independently by two authors ; conflicts were adjudicated by a third author . Data were meta-analysed using Review Manager V.5.3 . A r and om effects model was decided on a priori because of the heterogeneity of study design ; data are risk ratio ( RR ) with 95 % CI . Main results  Thirty-five RCTs  reported  NEC  as an outcome . Seventeen reported  surgical NEC ;  all RCTs were included . A variety of probiotic products was administered across studies . Description of  surgical NEC  in most studies was poor . Only 6/16 specifically reported  incidence of surgery for NEC  , 12/17 Bell ’s stage 3 and 13/17  NEC-associated mortality .  Although there was a trend towards  probiotic administration  reducing  stage 3 NEC  , this was not significant ( RR 0.74 ( 0.52–1.05 ) , p=0.09 ) . There was no effect of   probiotics   on the  RR of surgery for NEC  ( RR 0.84 ( 0.56–1.25 ) , p=0.38  )  .  Probiotics  did , however , reduce the  risk of NEC-associated mortality  ( RR 0.56 ( 0.34–0.93 ) , p=0.03 ) . Conclusion Despite 35 RCTs on probiotic prevention of NEC , evidence for prevention of surgical NEC is not strong , partly due to poor reporting . In studies included in this meta- analysis ,  probiotic administration  was associated with a reduction in NEC-related mortality."
"gWorkplace  stressors  have been indicated to play a role in the development of neck and upper extremity pain possibly through an increase of sustained ( low-level ) muscle activity . The aim of this review was to study the effects of  workplace stressors  on muscle activity in the neck-shoulder and forearm muscles . An additional aim was to find out whether the muscles of the neck-shoulder and the forearm are affected differently by different types of workplace stressors . A systematic literature search was conducted on studies investigating the relation between   simulated or realistic workplace stressors  and neck-shoulder and forearm muscle activity .  For studies meeting the inclusion criteria , a risk of bias assessment was performed and data were extracted for synthesis . Results were pooled when possible and otherwise described .  Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria  ,  reporting  data  of 25 different studies .  Except for one field study , all included studies were laboratory studies . Data of  19 articles  could be included in the meta- analysis and revealed a statistically significant , medium increase in  neck-shoulder and forearm muscle activity  as a result of workplace stressors . In subgroup analyses , we found an equal effect of different stressor types ( i.e.  cognitive/emotional stress , work pace , and precision )  on  muscle activity  in both body regions . In conclusion ,  simulated  workplace  stressors  result in an increase in  neck-shoulder and forearm muscle activity .  No indications were found that different types of stressors affect these body regions differently . These conclusions are fully based on laboratory studies , since field studies on this topic are currently lacking."

" Interventions comprising  education  ( e.g. , providing  information about behaviors associated with health risks ) and skills training  ( e.g. , teaching skills that equip participants to engage in less risky behavior ) and targeting multiple risk behaviors concurrently are associated with  small changes in diet and physical activity .  Although on  average smoking  was reduced , it appeared  changes in smoking  were negatively associated with  changes in other behaviors  , suggesting it may not be optimal to target smoking simultaneously with other risk behaviors."
"eThe term neuroenhancement refers to improvement in the cognitive , emotional and motivational functions of  healthy individuals  through , inter alia , the use of drugs . Of known interventions , psychopharmacology provides readily available options , such as  methylpheni date and modafinil .  Both drugs are presumed to be in widespread use as  cognitive enhancers  for non-medical reasons . Based on a systematic review and meta- analysis we show that expectations regarding the effectiveness of these drugs exceed their actual effects , as has been demonstrated in single- or double-blind r and omised controlled trials . Only studies with sufficient extractable data were included in the statistical analyses . For methylpheni  date  an improvement  of memory  was found , but no consistent evidence for other enhancing effects was uncovered .  Modafinil  on the other h and , was found to  improve attention for well-rested individuals  , while maintaining  wakefulness , memory and executive functions  to a significantly higher degree in  sleep  deprived  individuals  than did a  placebo .  However , repeated doses of  modafinil  were unable to prevent  deterioration of cognitive performance  over a longer period of sleep deprivation though maintaining wakefulness and possibly even inducing  overconfidence  in a person 's own cognitive performance."
"IBackground Medial stabilized   total knee  joint  replacement  ( TKJR )  construct is design ed to closely replicate the kinematics of the knee . Little is known regarding comparison of clinical functional outcomes of  patients utilising vali date d patient reported outcome measures ( PROM ) after medial stabilized TKJR and other construct design s.  Purpose To perform a systematic review of the available literature related to the assessment of clinical functional outcomes following a   TKJR   employing a  medial stabilized construct  design  .  Methods The review was performed with a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) algorithm . The literature search was performed using variouscombinations of keywords . The statistical analysis was completed using Review Manager ( RevMan ) , Version 5.3 . Results In the nineteen unique studies identified ,  there  were  2,448  medial stabilized TKJRs  implanted in 2,195 participants ,  there were  1,777  TKJRs  with  non-medial  stabilized design constructs implanted in 1,734 subjects .  The  final mean Knee Society Score ( KSS ) value  in the medial stabilized group was 89.92 compared to 90.76 in the non-medial stabilized group , with the final  KSS  mean value difference between the two groups was statistically significant and favored the non-medial stabilized group ( SMD 0.21 ; 95 % CI : 0.01 to 0.41 ; p = 004 ) . The mean difference in the  final WOMAC values  between the two groups was also statistically significant and favored the medial stabilized group ( SMD : -0.27 ; 95 % CI : -0.47 to -0.07 ; p = 0.009 ) . Moderate to high values ( I2 ) of heterogeneity were observed during the statistical comparison of these functional outcomes . Conclusion Based on the small number of studies with appropriate statistical analysis , we are unable to reach a clear conclusion in the clinical performance of medial stabilized knee replacement construct .

"hBackground The majority of  patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes  show insufficient levels of  daily physical activity ( PA )  and usually are among the least likely to engage in or adhere to any form of generic PA  . Active video games ( exergames )  may be a solution to motivate these individuals to overcome their sedentary lifestyle . Objectives This systematic review was conducted to review the current evidence for the effectiveness of  exergaming  in overweight  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  and thus to evaluate the suitability of these games to be used as tools for exercise promotion that meet current PA guidelines . Methods We search ed electronic bibliographic data bases ( PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , OpenGrey , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) up to March 2015 . R and  omized  controlled trials ( RCT ) and cross-sectional studies published in English in a peer- review ed journal and analyzing the effects of  exergames  on objective ly measured intensity parameters of PA in  overweight ( body mass index [ BMI ] ≥25 kg/m2 ) adults ( mean age ≥18 years ) with and without type 2 diabetes were included .  Study selection , data extraction , and quality assessment were performed independently by two review authors . Primary outcomes included  changes in oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) , energy expenditure ( EE ) , heart rate ( HR ) , or activity counts .  Secondary outcomes  were enjoyment of treatment , exercise adherence , ratings of perceived exertion ( RPE ) , changes in body composition , and changes in blood parameters ( serum glucose , long-term blood glucose , blood cholesterol , triglycerides , or serum lactate )  . Results  Of 2845 records , 14 publications ( 11 studies ) met  the inclusion criteria . All included studies ( ten experimental , cross-sectional laboratory studies and one RCT ) were able to show increases in  either VO2 , EE , HR , or activity counts .  However , effects  of exergaming  in terms of changes in these intensity parameters varied significantly between game modes and consoles as well as because of the vastly differing duration s of exergame activity between studies . One of the included studies had a low risk of bias , and three had a high risk of bias ; seven studies had an unclear risk of bias as the study description was insufficient . No studies were found investigating the changes in objective ly measured PA intensity parameters in  patients with type 2 diabetes .  Conclusion This review suggests  that exergames  are able to increase PA among  overweight individuals .  However , the inconsistent results and the overall poor or moderate method ological quality do not permit judgment on  whether exergames  are suitable to meet PA guidelines in this target group . The lack of research regarding the  effects of  exergames   in  type 2 diabetes  indicates a great need for future research."
"nThere is evidence that  vitamin D status  is associated with  type 2 diabetes .  Many observational studies have been performed investigating the relationship of  vitamin D  status and circulating  biomarkers of glycemic regulation  . To find out whether this association holds , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of cross sectional and longitudinal studies . We search ed Pubmed , Medline and Embase , all through June 2017 . The studies were selected to determine the effect of  vitamin D  on the parameters of glucose metabolism in  diabetic and non-diabetic subjects .  Correlation coefficients from all studies were pooled in a r and om effects meta- analysis . The risk of bias was assessed using  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) system  . We found significant  inverse relationship  of vitamin D  status with glycemic level  in both  diabetic  ( r = −0.223 , 95 % CI = −0.184 to −0.261 , p = 0.000 )  and non-diabetic (  r = −0.073 , 95 % CI = −0.052 to −0.093 , p = 0.000  ) subjects .  This meta- analysis concludes that  hypovitaminosis D  is associated with  increased risk of hyperglycemia  both  in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects .  A future strategy for the prevention of  impaired glycemic regulation  could be individualized supplementation of vitamin."
" The available evidence suggests that  plasma and serum concentrations of total vitamin B-12 , methylmalonic acid , and total homocysteine  are all effective biomarkers of a change in vitamin B-12 intake ; however , because the available data were limited , it was not possible to examine fully the factors that could explain the substantial heterogeneity in total vitamin B-12 . Future trials should include  low-dose  vitamin B-12  in adults across the entire age spectrum  and measure the holotranscobalamin response to supplementation."
"dBackground  Gross motor skills  are fundamental to childhood development . The effectiveness of current  physical therapy  options for  children with mild to moderate gross motor disorders  is unknown . The aim of this study was to systematic ally review the literature to investigate the effectiveness of conservative interventions to improve  gross motor performance  in  children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders .  Methods A systematic review with meta- analysis was conducted . MEDLINE , EMBASE , AMED , CINAHL , PsycINFO , PEDro , Cochrane Collaboration , Google Scholar data bases and clinical trial registries were search ed . Published r and omised controlled trials including  children 3 to ≤18 years with ( i ) Developmental Coordination Disorder ( DCD ) or Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) ( Gross Motor Function Classification System Level 1 ) or Developmental Delay or Minimal Acquired Brain Injury or Prematurity ( < 30 weeks gestational age ) or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders ; and ( ii )  receiving non-pharmacological or non-surgical interventions from a health professional  and ( iii ) gross motor outcomes obtained using a st and ardised assessment tool .  Meta- analysis was performed to determine the pooled effect of intervention on gross motor function . Method ological  quality  and  strength of meta- analysis recommendations  were evaluated using PEDro and the GRADE approach respectively . Results  Of 2513 papers , 9 met inclusion criteria including children with CP ( n = 2 ) or DCD ( n = 7 ) receiving 11 different interventions .  Only two of 9 trials showed an effect for treatment . Using the least conservative trial outcomes a  large beneficial effect of  intervention was shown ( SMD:-0.8 ; 95 % CI:-1.1 to −0.5 ) with “ very low quality ” GRADE ratings . Using the most conservative trial outcomes there is no treatment effect ( SMD:-0.1 ; 95 % CI:-0.3 to 0.2 ) with “ low quality ” GRADE ratings . Study limitations included the small number and poor quality of the available trials . Conclusion Although we found that some interventions with a task-orientated framework can  improve gross motor outcomes  in  children with DCD or CP  , these findings are limited by the very low quality of the available evidence . High quality intervention trials are urgently needed."
"dAccording to a systematic review on the use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs )  in  adult depression  that was recently published in BMC Psychiatry , the results of which have been widely disseminated in lay media , these drugs increase the risk for  serious adverse events ( SAEs )  while exerting poor antidepressant efficacy . A cursory analysis , however , suggests the analysis of  SAEs  conducted by the authors to be marred by both method ological inaccuracies and blatant errors . After having corrected for these apparent mistakes , we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we also accounted for a possible moderating effect of age ; while this suggests SSRIs to be safe drugs in the non-elderly , they do confirm what is already known , that is , that they may enhance the risk for  SAEs  in the old . Given the loose definition of  SAE  , including also innocuous phenomena , the possible clinical significance of the latter observation , however , remains unclear until the nature and actual impact of the SAEs in question have been clarified . Moreover , with respect to  efficacy  , we find the paper in BMC Psychiatry misleading : first , the authors seem unaware of the well-established shortcomings associated with the conventional  efficacy  parameter on which their analysis is based , second , they have included suboptimal SSRI doses and third , they have missed some pivotal trials . Unless there are explanations for the many peculiarities in this paper that have escaped us , and which may be satisfactorily clarified by the authors , it seems important that the conclusions presented in this paper be publicly rectified."

"sBACKGROUND & AIMS  Dietary approaches to stop hypertension ( DASH ) diet  is associated with improved  blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular diseases .  It is proposed that DASH might also improve systemic inflammatory markers like highly sensitive C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) ; however , interventional studies have led to conflicting results . The aim of current systematic review was to summarize results of r and omized clinical trials examining the effect of DASH on  inflammatory biomarkers .  METHODS R and omized trials which assessed the effect of  adherence to DASH diet  on the   circulating inflammatory biomarkers  in adults  were identified through search ing PubMed , EMBASE , Scopus and Google Scholar up to December 2016 . Difference in Mean change and its corresponding st and ard deviation in  inflammatory markers  between intervention and control groups were calculated to be used as effect size . R and om effects model was used to calculate the summary effects . RESULTS  Seven trials were eligible and six studies with 451 participants were included  in the meta- analysis which measured  hs-CRP  as the biomarker of systemic inflammation .  The DASH diet  significantly decreased  serum hs-CRP levels  [ mean difference ( MD ) = -1.01 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : -1.64 , -0.38 ; I-squared ( I2 ) = 67.7 % ] compared to  usual diets ;  however , the effect was not significant when it was compared with healthy diets ( MD = 0.10 mg/L ; 95%CI : -0.16 , 0.37 ; I2 = 94.0 % ) . The  reduction in serum hs-CRP levels  was greater in trials lasted eight weeks or more .   Adherence to DASH diet  is effective in improving  circulating serum inflammatory biomarkers  in  adults  , compared with  usual diet ;  therefore , it could be a valuable strategy to suppress inflammation process."
"sAlthough higher dietary intakes of  magnesium  ( Mg  )  seem to correspond to lower diabetes incidence , research concerning  Mg  supplementation in  people with  or at risk  of diabetes  is limited . Thus , we aim ed to investigate the effect of  oral Mg supplementation  on  glucose and insulin-sensitivity parameters  in  participants with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes  compared with  placebo .  A literature search in PubMed , EMBASE , SCOPUS , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinical trials.gov without language restriction , was undertaken . Eligible studies were r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating the effect of  oral Mg supplementation vs placebo  in  patients with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes .  St and ardized mean differences ( SMD ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were used for summarizing outcomes with at least two studies ; other outcomes were summarized descriptively .  Eighteen RCTs ( 12 in people with diabetes and 6 in people at high risk of diabetes ) were included  . Compared with  placebo  ( n=334 ) ,  Mg  treatment ( n=336 )  reduced fasting plasma glucose  ( studies = 9 ; SMD=−0.40 ; 95 % CI : −0.80 to −0.00 ; I2=77 % ) in people with diabetes . In conditions in people at high risk of diabetes ( Mg  :  226 ; placebo=227 participants ) , Mg supplementation significantly  improved plasma glucose levels  after a  2 h oral glucose tolerance test  ( three studies ; SMD=−0.35 ; 95 % CI : −0.62 to −0.07 ; I2=0 % ) and demonstrated trend level reductions  in HOMA-IR  ( homeostatic model assessment -insulin resistance ; five studies ; SMD=−0.57 ; 95 % CI : −1.17 to 0.03 ; I2=88 % ) . Mg supplementation appears to have a  beneficial role and improves glucose parameters  in people with diabetes and also  improves insulin-sensitivity parameters  in those at high risk of diabetes."
"dDespite the overwhelming evidence supporting the effectiveness of antihypertensive medication , hypertension remains poorly controlled in  low and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) .   Lifestyle intervention  studies reporting effects on  blood pressure  published  from January 1977 to September 2012  were search ed on various data bases .  From the 6211 references identified , 52 were included in the systematic review ( 12 , 024 participants ) and 43 were included in the meta- analysis ( in total 6779 participants ) .  We calculated and pooled effect sizes in mmHg with r and om-effects models . We grouped interventions into  behavioral counseling  ( 1831 participants ) ,  dietary modification  ( 1831 participants ) ,  physical activity  ( 1014 participants ) and  multiple interventions  ( 2103 participants ) . Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to evaluate origins of heterogeneity . Lifestyle interventions significantly lowered   blood pressure  levels in LMIC population s , including in total 6779 participants .  The changes achieved in  SBP  ( 95 % confidence interval ) were :  behavioral  counseling -5.4 ( -10.7 , -0.0 ) mmHg , for dietary modification -3.5 ( -5.4 , -1.5 ) mmHg , for physical activity -11.4 ( -16.0 , -6.7 ) mmHg and for multiple interventions -6.0 ( -8.9 , -3.3 ) mmHg . The heterogeneity was high across studies and the quality was generally low . Subgroup analyses showed smaller sample s reporting larger effect sizes ; intervention lasting less than 6 months showed larger effect sizes and intention-to-treat analysis showed smaller effect sizes  Lifestyle interventions  may be of value in preventing and reducing  blood pressure  in  LMICs .  Nevertheless , the overall quality and sample size of the studies included were low . Improvements in the size and quality of studies evaluating lifestyle interventions are required."
"tOBJECTIVE To evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for  yoga  as an ancillary intervention in  rheumatic diseases .  METHODS Medline / PubMed , Scopus , the Cochrane Library and IndMED were search ed through February 2013 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing  yoga  with  control interventions  in  patients with rheumatic diseases  were included . Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Back Review Group risk of bias tool . The quality of evidence and the strength of the recommendation for or against  yoga  were grade d according to the GRADE recommendations . RESULTS  Eight RCTs with a total of 559 subjects were included ;  two RCTs had a low risk of bias . In two RCTs on FM syndrome , there was very low evidence for  effects on pain  and low evidence for  effects on disability .  In three RCTs on OA , there was very low evidence for  effects on pain and disability .  Based on two RCTs , very low evidence was found for  effects on pain  in RA . No evidence for  effects on pain  was found in one RCT on CTS . No RCT explicitly reported  safety data  .  Based on the results of this review , only weak recommendations can be made for the ancillary use of  yoga  in the management of  FM syndrome  ,  OA  and RA at this point."

"pOBJECTIVE Little is known about the extent to which   physical activity ( PA )   levels change  following total knee or hip joint replacement  relative to pain , physical function , and quality of life . Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis on changes in PA relative to  pain , quality of life , and physical function   after total knee or hip joint replacement .  METHODS We search ed the  PubMed ( Medline ) , Embase , and CINAHL data bases for peer- review ed , English- language cohort studies measuring  PA  with an  accelerometer  from presurgery to postsurgery .  R and om-effects models were used to produce st and ardized mean differences ( SMDs )  for PA , quality of life , pain , and physical function outcomes .  Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 . RESULTS  Seven studies ( 336 participants ) met the eligibility criteria .  No significant increase in  PA  was found at 6 months ( SMD 0.14 [ 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) -0.05 , 0.34 ] ; I2 = 0 % ) and a small to moderately significant effect was found for  increasing PA  at 12 months ( SMD 0.43 [ 95 % CI 0.22 , 0.64 ] ; I2 = 0 % ) . Large improvements were found at 6  months  in  physical function  ( SMD 0.97 [ 95 % CI 0.12 , 1.82 ] ; I2 = 92.3 % ) ,  pain  ( SMD -1.47 [ 95 % CI -2.28 , -0.65 ] ; I2 = 91.6 % ) , and  quality of life  ( SMD 1.02 [ 95 % CI 0.30 , 1.74 ] ; I2 = 83.2 % ) .   Physical activity  did not change at 6 months , and a small to moderate improvement was found at 12 months postsurgery , despite large improvements in  quality of life , pain , and physical function .  Reasons for the lack of increased PA are unknown but may be behavioral in nature , as a sedentary lifestyle is difficult to change . Changing sedentary behavior should be a future focus of research in this subgroup."

"sThe aims of this systematic review are ( 1 ) to compare the prevalence of xerostomia and hyposalivation between  patients taking  antihypertensive drugs  with a  control  group ( CG )  , ( 2 ) to compare  salivary flow rate  between  patients treated with a CG  , and ( 3 ) to identify which  antihypertensives  produce xerostomia . This systematic review was carried out according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review s and meta-analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines . To evaluate method ological quality of the eligible studies Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias for clinical trials and the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale case-control studies were used . The data bases were search ed for studies up  to November 19th 2019 .  The search strategy yielded  6201 results and 13 publications were finally included (  five  clinical trials  and eight case-control studies  ) .  The results of the included studies did not provide evidence to state that  patients taking   antihypertensives  suffer more  xerostomia or hyposalivation  than patients not taking them . With regard to  salivary flow  , only two clinical studies showed a significant decrease in  salivary flow  and even one showed a significant increase after treatment . The case-control studies showed great variability in  salivary flow  , but in this case most studies showed how  salivary flow  is lower in  patients medicated with antihypertensive drugs .  The great variability of  antihypertensive drugs  included , the types of studies and the outcomes collected made it impossible to study which antihypertensive drug produces more salivary alterations . The quality assessment showed how each of the studies was of low  method  ological quality . Therefore , future studies about this topic are necessary to confirm whether antihypertensive drugs produce salivary alterations."
" There are few studies in the field of dance and fibromyalgia , suggesting research is in its infancy but slowly growing . They are of  European and South American  origin , focusing on female participants and a limited number of dance modes . Because the body of literature is small , of low quality and highly heterogeneous , we concluded that a systematic review of interventions on  dance  is not warranted at this time."

"sConcerns have been raised about the adverse effect of   fructose   on blood pressure .   International dietary guidelines , however , have not addressed  fructose  intake directly . A systematic review and meta- analysis was conducted to assess the effect of  fructose  in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrates on   systolic , diastolic , and mean arterial blood pressures .   Studies were identified using Medline , Embase , and Cochrane data bases ( through January 9 , 2012 ) .  Human clinical trials of  isocaloric oral fructose exchange  for other carbohydrate sources for ≥7 days  were included in the analysis . Data were pooled by the generic inverse variance method using r and om-effects models and expressed as mean differences with 95 % CI . Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q-statistic and quantified by I(2 ) . Study quality was assessed using the Heyl and Method ological Quality Score .  Thirteen isocaloric ( n=352 ) and 2 hypercaloric ( n=24 ) trials met  the eligibility criteria . Overall , fructose intake in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrates significantly  decreased diastolic  ( mean difference : -1.54 [ 95 % CI : -2.77 to -0.32 ]  ) and mean arterial pressure  ( mean difference : -1.16 [ 95 % CI : -2.15 to -0.18 ] ) . There was no significant effect of fructose  on systolic blood pressure  ( mean difference : -1.10 [ 95 % CI : -2.46 to 0.44 ] ) .  The hypercaloric  fructose feeding trials found no significant  overall mean arterial blood pressure  effect  of  fructose in comparison with other carbohydrates . To confirm these results , longer and larger trials are needed . Contrary to previous concerns , we found that isocaloric substitution of fructose for other carbohydrates did not adversely  affect blood  pressure in humans."
"sBACKGROUND  Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI )  can lead to  complications , recurrence , and death .  Numerous studies have assessed risk factors for these unfavourable outcomes , but systematic review s or meta-analyses published so far were limited in scope or in quality . METHODS A systematic review was completed according to PRISMA guidelines . An electronic search in five data bases was performed .  Studies published  until  October 2013  were included if risk factors for at least one CDI outcome were assessed with multivariate analyses . RESULTS  68 studies were included :  24 assessed risk  factors  for  recurrence  , 18 for complicated CDI , 8 for treatment failure , and  30  for   mortality   . Most studies accounted for  mortality  in the definition of complicated CDI . Important variables were inconsistently reported , such as previous episodes and use of antibiotics . Substantial heterogeneity and method ological limitations were noted , mainly in the sample size , the definition of the outcomes and periods of follow-up , precluding a meta- analysis . Older age , use of antibiotics after diagnosis , use of proton pump inhibitors , and strain type were the most frequent risk factors for recurrence  .  Older age , leucocytosis , renal failure and co-morbidities were frequent risk factors for complicated CDI . When considered alone ,  mortality  was associated with age , co-morbidities , hypo-albuminemia , leucocytosis , acute renal failure , and infection with ribotype 027 .  Laboratory parameters currently used in European and American guidelines to define patients at risk of a complicated CDI are adequate . Strategies for the management of CDI should be tailored according to the age of the patient , biological markers of severity , and underlying co-morbidities."

"yObjective : To synthesize evidence on  older adults ’   sedentary behavior  and  physical activity  during rehabilitation and recovery for  hip fracture  ( 1 ) across the care continuum and ( 2 ) from clinical interventions . Design : We conducted a systematic review of peer- review ed publications using CINAHL , Embase , Ovid MEDLINE , PsycINFO , and SportD iscus ( last search : 17 October 2017 ) . Study selection : We included studies that measured  sedentary behavior  and  physical activity  of  older adults with hip fracture using  activity monitors (  e.g.  accelerometers )   . We identified literature at Level 1 ( title and abstract ) and Level 2 ( full text ) , and conducted forward and backward search es . We assessed observational studies ’ adherence to reporting guidelines and intervention studies ’ risk of bias . Results :  We included 14 studies ( 882 participants ) .  Four studies reported  sedentary behavior data  , while all studies reported information on  physical activity  . Setting s included  hospital , rehabilitation centers , and the community .  Nine studies were observational ; five were experimental design .  Older adults  had  excessive sedentary time  ( > 10 hours/day ) and  low physical activity .  Participants  ’ average upright time  differed across setting s. During hospital stay , it ranged 16–52 minutes/day , while in the community , it ranged 51–261 minutes/day . Data from five interventions reported  on physical activity change :  two studies increased between 14 and 27 minutes/day . Another study reported participants accumulated 6994  steps/day  at the end of the intervention , but for two other interventions ,  activity  was below 5000 steps/day . Conclusion : Based on available evidence ,  older adults with hip fracture  engage in  prolonged sedentary behavior  and have low levels  of physical activity  during rehabilitation and recovery."

"sObjectives : This systematic review aim ed to identify and evaluate prognostic factors for  long-term  ( ≥6 mo ) physical functioning in  patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain following  multidisciplinary rehabilitation ( MDR )  .  Material s and Methods : Electronic search es conducted in MEDLINE , PsycINFO , EMBASE , CINAHL , Web of Science , and Cochrane CENTRAL revealed  25 original research reports  ,  published 1983  -  2016  ,  ( n=9436 )  . Potential prognostic factors relating to initial pain and  physical  and  psychological functioning  were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively in r and om effects meta-analyses . The level of evidence ( LoE ) was evaluated with Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Results :  Pain-related factors (  intensity and chronicity ) were not associated  with function/disability  at long-term follow-up , odds ratio (OR)=0.84 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.65 - 1.07 and OR=0.97 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 1.00 , respectively ( moderate LoE ) . A better function at follow-up was predicted by Physical factors ; higher  levels of initial self-reported functioning  , OR=1.07 ; 95 % CI , 1.02 - 1.13 ( low LoE ) , and Psychological factors  ; low initial levels of emotional distress  , OR=0.77 ; 95 % CI , 0.65 - 0.92 ,  low levels of cognitive and behavioral risk factors  , OR=0.85 ; 95 % CI , 0.77 - 0.93 and high  levels of protective cognitive and behavioral factors  , OR=1.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.17 - 1.90 ( moderate LoE ) . Discussion : While pain intensity and long-term chronicity did not predict physical functioning in  chronic pain patients  after MDR , poor pretreatment physical and psychological functioning influenced the prognosis negatively . Thus , treatment should further target and optimize these modifiable factors and an increased focus on positive , psychological protective factors may perhaps provide an opening for yet untapped clinical gains."

" This systematic review indicates that  lithium  is more effective than  placebo  as a treatment for acute mania but increases the  risk for somnolence and tremor .  Limited evidence suggests little or no difference between  lithium  and other  mood stabilisers ( valproate , carbamazepine )  or  antipsychotics ( risperidone , quetiapine , haloperidol )  .  Olanzapine  may be an exception , as it is probably slightly more effective than  lithium .  There is uncertain evidence that  risperidone  may also be more effective than  lithium . Lithium  is probably more  effective  at  treating acute mania  than  topiramate .  When compared to  placebo , lithium  was more likely to cause  adverse events .  However , when compared to other drugs , too few studies provided data on adverse effects to provide high-certainty evidence . More , rigorously design ed , large-scale studies are needed to definitively conclude if  lithium  is superior to other interventions in treating acute  mania ."
"dPatients  with permanent pacemakers ( PM )  are at high risk of developing  atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .  Minimal ventricular pacing modalities have been demonstrated to reduce  AF  in such patients , although they are not suitable for  patients with advanced atrioventricular conduction disease .  Recent evidence s suggest that  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ( i.e. statins )  may represent a new strategy to prevent  AF  in  patients at  risk  .  In this article , we sought to review data regarding the effectiveness of  statin therapy  in preventing  AF patients with a PM .  We review ed all available studies that assessed the effect of  statin therapy  on the  occurrence of AF  in  patients with PM , implanted due to sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction disease .  Moreover , a r and om effect inverse variance-weighted meta- analysis was performed , by entering directly the logarithm of the hazard ratio  (  HR  )  of AF provided in the multiple Cox regression analyses from each study .  Three studies were identified , including 552 patients , of whom 159 received  statins .   Follow-up ranged from 1 to 2.77 years . Two studies ( one observational and one prospect i ve r and omized ) included  predominantly patients with sinus node dysfunction ( 70 % and 91 % of patient population  , respectively  )  and , consistently , showed a beneficial effect of  statins  on the  occurrence  of  AF .  On the other h and , the study including  predominantly patients with atrioventricular block ( 60 % of patient population  ) failed to show a beneficial effect of  statins  on  AF occurrence .  The  HR for AF occurrence  for the cumulative data was found to be 0.43 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.28 - 0.67 , P < 0.001 ) .  Statistical heterogeneity  between included studies was not detected ( chi(2 ) = 1.68 , P = 0.43 , I(2 ) = 0 % ) , although significant clinical differences were found in terms of study design , patient population s ,  statins  use and dosage and AF-monitoring capabilities .  Statins  may represent a novel treatment strategy to prevent the  occurrence of AF  in  patients with PM  , especially for those  who had a PM implanted due to sinus node dysfunction  . Basing on our findings , a r and omized clinical trial with a proper design to evaluate the utility of  statins  in preventing  AF  in these patients is warranted."

"sAim or objective The aim of this study is to consoli date studies of physiological measures following  sport-related concussion ( SRC )  to determine if a time course of postinjury altered neurobiology can be outlined . This biological time course was considered with respect to clinical ly relevant outcomes such as vulnerability to repeat injury and safe timing of return to physical contact risk . Design Systematic review . Data sources PubMed , CINAHL , Cochrane Central , PsychINFO . Eligibility criteria for selecting studies  Studies were  included if  they reported original  research on  physiological or neurobiological changes after SRC . Excluded were cases series < 5 subjects , review s , meta-analyses , editorials , animal research and research not pertaining to SRC .  Results  A total of 5834 articles were identified , of which 80 were included  for full-text data extraction and review . Relatively few longitudinal studies exist that follow both  physiological dysfunction  and  clinical measures  to recovery . Summary / conclusions Modalities of measuring  physiological  change after SRC were categorised into the following :   functional MRI  ,  diffusion tensor imaging , magnetic resonance spectroscopy  ,  cerebral blood flow  , electrophysiology ,  heart  rate ,  exercise  ,  fluid biomarkers  and  transcranial magnetic stimulation  .  Due to differences in modalities , time course , study design and outcomes , it is not possible to define a single ‘ physiological time window ’ for SRC recovery . Multiple studies suggest physiological dysfunction may outlast current clinical measures of recovery , supporting a buffer zone of gradually increasing activity before full contact risk . Future studies need to use generalisable population s , longitudinal design s following to physiological and clinical recovery and careful correlation of neurobiological modalities with clinical measures."

">Context Which  lipid-lowering policies with statins  are  cost-effective  ? Contribution This modeling exercise found that the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines , which recommend treatment based on cholesterol level and estimated coronary heart disease risk , are reasonably  cost-effective  if  statins  cost about $ 1.50 to $ 2.20 per pill . At costs lower than $ 0.10 per pill , treating all  persons with LDL cholesterol levels  greater than  3.4 mmol/L (  >  130  mg/dL  )  could be a better strategy . Implication Optimum policies for lipid lowering with  statins  are highly dependent on statin costs . The Editors Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) is the leading cause of death in the United States ( 1 ) . Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase , known as  statins  , lower  cholesterol  and prevent  CHD events and mortality  ( 2 , 3 ) . However ,  statins  are expensive and sometimes cause  side effects  , which makes it difficult for patients , physicians , and policymakers to decide who should receive them . The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection , Evaluation , and Treatment of  High Blood Cholesterol  in Adults ( Adult Treatment Panel III , or ATP III ) , published by the National Cholesterol Education Program in 2001 ( 4 ) and up date d in 2004 ( 3 ) , provides comprehensive recommendations on when and how to treat high cholesterol levels with  statins  . These guidelines recommend treatment on the basis of a combination of  cholesterol level  and  estimated CHD risk  , with more aggressive cholesterol treatment thresholds recommended for patients with higher estimated risk . Adherence to ATP III guidelines is modest ( 5 , 6 ) , and many questions remain about strategy 's cost , complexity , and  efficiency  ( 6 ) . Previous cost-effectiveness analyses ( 719 ) show that  statin therapy  is generally  cost-effective  for secondary prevention and for high-risk primary prevention but do not focus on population -level impact or average  cost-effectiveness  across the heterogeneous U.S. population , including such subgroups of patients as those with  low risk but very high cholesterol levels  . Also , it is unclear whether the ATP III approach to risk stratification , in which risk is formally assessed only for patients with 2 or more established risk factors , is the simplest and most  cost-effective  way of targeting  statin therapy  . Finally , ATP III bases treatment decisions on both  risk and cholesterol level .  The 2004 up date to ATP III ( 3 ) notes that treatment of high-risk subgroups may be useful even when  cholesterol levels  are low , which suggests that a more purely risk-based approach may be simpler and more  cost-effective  than the ATP III approach . An even simpler algorithm based on patient age might provide similar  cost-effectiveness  , given that age is the primary driver of CHD risk ( 20 ) . The  CHD Policy Model  is a mathematical state-transition model of  CHD in the United States  that can be used to project event rates and costs related to CHD . We used the model to evaluate ATP III primary prevention guidelines and to compare the strategy 's overall impact , cost , and cost-effectiveness with alternative risk- and  age-based  strategies under varying assumptions about the cost and side effects of statins . Methods Structure of the Model The  CHD Policy Model  is a computer-simulated , state-transition ( Markov cohort ) model of  CHD incidence ,  prevalence  , mortality , and costs among persons older than 35 years in the U.S. population .  The demographicepidemiologic submodel predicts  CHD incidence  and  non-CHD mortality  among  persons without CHD , stratified by age , sex , diastolic blood pressure , smoking status , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol level , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol level , diabetes mellitus , and use of statin therapy .  After CHD develops , a bridge submodel characterizes the initial CHD event ( cardiac arrest , myocardial infa rct ion , or angina ) and its sequelae over 30 days . A disease history submodel then predicts  subsequent CHD events , revascularization procedures , CHD mortality , and non-CHD mortality  among  patients with CHD  ,  stratified by age ,  sex  , and  history of events . Each health state and event has an annual  cost and quality -of-life  adjustment . All  population distributions , risk factor levels , coefficients , event rates , case-fatality rates , costs , and quality -of-life adjustments  can be modified for forecasting simulations . More details about the model have been published elsewhere ( 2123 ) and are also in the Appendix . Data Sources  We used population size projections for 2000 to 2050  , provided by the  2000 U.S. Census (  24  )  , and  data  from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  Survey  ,  1999 to 2004  ( 25 ) , to estimate joint distributions of risk factor values in the  U.S. population  . We estimated the background prevalence of CHD in 2000 from the National Health Interview Survey , 2000 ( 26 ) . We estimated  CHD deaths , prehospital deaths from cardiac arrest , and non-CHD deaths  from U.S. Vital Statistics ( 27 ) on the basis of codes from the International Classification of Diseases , 10th revision . We obtained  case-fatality and revascularization rates  and  the number of patients  who  had myocardial infa rct ions or out-of-hospital cardiac arrests  and survived to hospital discharge from the National Hospital Discharge Survey ( NHDS ) ( 28 ) and complementary sources ( Appendix ) . We estimated -coefficients that were conditional on age and sex by using examinations 9 to 13 of the  original Framingham cohort  and examinations 1 to 6 of the  offspring  ( 29 ) ( Appendix ) . The LDL cholesterol coefficient decreases in magnitude with increasing age in the model ( LDL cholesterol is a weaker risk factor in older adults ) , as estimated in the Framingham data ( Appendix ) .  Statin  efficacy was modeled via LDL cholesterollowering . Our model closely replicated the reduction in coronary events with statins ( 30 ) and approximated the cost-effectiveness ratios of individual trials ( 31 , 32 ) when we used their outcomes data ( Appendix ) . We estimated  total health care costs  from the perspective of the health care system by using national data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( 33 ) . We estimated the  CHD cost  component by  using California data  ( 34 ) , deflated by using cost-to-charge ratios ( 35 ) and the ratio of the U.S. national average costs to the California average ( 36 ) and then inflated to 2006 dollars by using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for Medical Care Costs ( 37 ) . We based health-related  quality  -of-life weights on observational data ( 38 ) and discounted  costs  and  quality -adjusted life-years  ( QALYs ) at a rate of 3 % per year . Statin Therapy Assumptions We categorized  statin  drugs and doses that decrease  LDL cholesterol level  by approximately 27 % ( such as  fluvastatin  , 40 mg ;  lovastatin  , 20 mg ;  pravastatin  , 20 mg ; and  simvastatin  , 10 mg ) as low intensity and those that decrease it by approximately 55 % ( such as  atorvastatin  , 80 mg , and  rosuvastatin  , 40 mg ) as high intensity ( 39 , 40 ) . We estimated  direct medication costs  for the base-case scenario by averaging the lowest average wholesale price reported in the 2006 National Drug Data File for low-intensity  statins  ( $ 2.11 per pill ) and high-intensity  statins  ( $ 2.81 per pill ) . An informal telephone and Web site survey we conducted in 2008 , which examined  out-of-pocket costs  for a  self-insured patient  to buy  statins  of different types in various setting s , showed that  costs  varied from $ 0.17 per pill ( generic  lovastatin  at large discount chains ) to $ 5.00 per pill or more ( nongeneric  statins  at retail pharmacy chains ) . Because of this range , we performed sensitivity analyses that specified the preferred strategy at any given statin pill cost . We held the ratio of pill costs for  low- to high-intensity statins  ( $ 2.11:$2.81 ) constant in all analyses . We derived  side-effect rates  from a systematic review of statin trials ( 41 ) and assumed that side effects occurred at twice the rate for high-intensity  statins  on the basis of data ( 42 ) that indicated that some side effects are dose-related . We based some of our assumptions about extra monitoring requirements for  patients receiving statins  and for the consequences of myopathy and hepatitis episodes on clinical judgment ( Table 1 ) ( 4345 ) . We derived the  costs of hospitalization for acute kidney failure  ( for rhabdomyolysis ) and  liver failure  from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ( 46 ) . For the base-case scenario , we assumed 100 % adherence to therapy and no quality -of-life decrement from the act of taking a  statin  pill every day ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 . Model Assumptions Comparing Lipid-Lowering Strategies For all analyses , we assumed full adherence to secondary prevention guidelines outlined in the 2004 ATP III up date ( 3 ) , which recommend aggressive lipid-lowering for  persons with known CHD or a CHD equivalent  , such as diabetes , and for  persons with a 10-year CHD risk greater than 20 % .  We assumed that a healthy lifestyle would be recommended for all persons and therefore held these factors constant across strategies at current levels . We applied ATP III primary prevention guidelines ( 4 ) by lowering LDL cholesterol levels for prescribed subgroups of the population defined by  LDL cholesterol level  ,  number of CHD risk factors  , and  10-year CHD risk  estimated by using the ATP III point-based algorithm ( Appendix ) . We assumed that  persons who were already receiving statins  were receiving a low-intensity statin and modeled the cost and  efficacy  of switching to a  higher-intensity statin .  On the basis of an analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2000 data that showed that 25 % of persons with  LDL cholesterol levels  greater than 4.1 mmol/L ( > 160 mg/dL ) would have levels greater than 4.9 mmol/L ( > 190 mg/dL ) , we simulated treating 25 % of persons with levels greater than 4.1 mmol/L ( > 160 mg/dL ) with statins according to the ATP III strategy . This assumption ( required because of limitations with the model ) introduces a slight bias in the direction of making ATP III look less  cost-effective . ."
"sAutism Spectrum  Disorder  ( ASD ) is a neurodevelopmental disease that is specially characterized by impairments in social communication and social skills .  ASD  has a high prevalence  in children  ,  affecting 1  in  160 subjects .   Virtual reality ( VR )  has emerged as an effective tool for intervention in the health field . Different recent papers have review ed the  VR-based treatments  in ASD , but they have an important limitation because they only use clinical data bases and do not include important technical indexes such as the Web of Science index or the Scimago Journal & Country Rank . To our knowledge , this is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence -based systematic review including both clinical and technical data bases about the effectiveness of  VR-based intervention  in ASD . The  initial search identified a total of 450 records .  After the exclusion of the papers that are not studies , duplicated articles , and the screening of the abstract and full text , 31 articles met the PICO ( Population , Intervention , Comparison and Outcomes ) criteria and were selected for analysis . The studies examined suggest moderate evidence about the  effectiveness  of   VR-based  treatments  in ASD .  VR  can add many advantages to the treatment of  ASD symptomatology  , but it is necessary to develop consistent validations in future studies to state that  VR  can effectively complement the traditional treatments."
"  Finasteride  improves  long-term urinary symptoms  versus  placebo  , but is less effective  than doxazosin .  Long-term combination therapy with  alpha blockers ( doxazosin , terazosin )  improves symptoms significantly better than finasteride monotherapy  . Finasteride + doxazosin  improves symptoms equally - and clinical ly - to  doxazosin  alone . In comparison  to doxazosin , finasteride + doxazosin  appears to  improve urinary symptoms  only in  men with medium ( 25 to <  40  mL ) or large prostates (  ≥ 40 mL ) , but not in  men with small prostates (  25 mL).Comparing short to long-term therapy , finasteride does not  improve symptoms  significantly better than  placebo  at the short term , but in the long term it does , although the magnitude of differences was very small ( from < 1.0  point  to 2.2  points ) . Doxazosin   improves symptoms  better  than  finasteride both short and long term , with the magnitude of differences ∼2.0 points and 1.0 point ,  respectively . Finasteride + doxazosin   improves  scores versus finasteride alone at both short and long term , with mean differences ∼2.0 points for both time   points  . Finasteride + doxazosin versus doxazosin   improves  scores equally for short and long term . Drug-related adverse effects  for  finasteride are rare ; nevertheless ,  men   taking   finasteride  are at increased  risk for impotence , erectile dysfunction , decreased libido , and ejaculation disorder  ,  versus placebo . Versus doxazosin  , which has higher  rates of dizziness , postural hypotension , and asthenia  , men taking finasteride are at increased risk  for impotence , erectile dysfunction , decreased libido , and ejaculation  disorder  .  Finasteride significantly  reduces asthenia , postural hypotension , and dizziness  versus  terazosin . Finasteride  significantly lowers the  risk of asthenia , dizziness , ejaculation disorder , and postural hypotension  , versus finasteride + terazosin."
 The effect of  alterations  in  dietary practice  irrespective of weight loss on  glycaemic control  can not be concluded from the present review . The need for further research in this area is apparent because no firm conclusions about relative effectiveness of interventions could be drawn as a result of the paucity of the evidence.
"nHomoeopathy is often advocated for  fibromyalgia ( FM )  and many  FM patients  use it . To critically evaluate all r and omised clinical trials ( RCTs ) of  homoeopathy  as a treatment for FM ,  six electronic data bases were search  ed to identify all  relevant  studies . Data extraction and the assessment of the  method ological quality  of all included studies were done by two independent review ers . Four RCTs were found , including two feasibility studies . Three studies were  placebo-controlled  . None of the trials was without serious flaws . Invariably , their results suggested that homoeopathy was better than the control interventions in  alleviating the symptoms of FM .  Independent replications are missing . Even though all RCTs suggested results that favour homoeopathy , important caveats exist . Therefore , the effectiveness of homoeopathy as a symptomatic treatment for  FM  remains unproven."
"7OBJECTIVES A systematic review and meta- analysis were performed on the risk and intensity  of postoperative sensitivity  ( POS ) in  posterior resin composite restorations bonded with  self-etch ( SE ) and etch- and -rinse ( ER ) adhesives .   SOURCE A comprehensive search was performed in the MEDLINE via PubMeb , Scopus , Web of Science , LILACS , BBO and Cochrane Library and SIGLE without restrictions . The abstract s of the annual conference of the IADR ( 1990 - 2014 ) , unpublished and ongoing trials registry were also search ed . Dissertations and theses were search ed using the ProQuest Dissertations and Periodicos Capes Theses data bases . STUDY SELECTION We included r  and omized  clinical trials that compared the  clinical effectiveness of  SE and ER   used for direct  resin composite restorations in permanent dentition of adult patients .  The  risk/intensity of POS  was the primary outcome . The risk of bias tool of the Cochrane Collaboration was used . The meta- analysis was performed on the studies considered ' low ' risk of bias . DATA After duplicates removal ,  2600 articles were identified but only 29 remained in the qualitative synthesis .  Five were considered to be ' high ' risk of bias and eleven were considered to be ' unclear ' in the key domains , yielding 13 studies for meta- analysis . The  overall relative risk  of the spontaneous POS was 0.63 ( 95 % CI 0.35 to 1.15 ) , while the stimuli-induced POS was 0.99 ( 95 % CI 0.63 to 1.56 ) . The overall st and ardized mean difference was 0.08 ( 95%CI -0.19 to 0.35 ) . No overall effect was revealed in the meta-analyses , meaning that no influence of the   ER or SE  strategy on POS  . SIGNIFICANCE The type of  adhesive strategy ( ER or SE )  for posterior resin composite restorations does not influence  the risk and intensity of POS .  CRD42014006617."
"sBecause there is a possibility that  cannabis  or  cannabis-like molecules  might be used as treatments for certain conditions in the future , it becomes important to consider the possible adverse effects of these compounds . In this paper , the authors review the evidence for  persisting  effects of nonacute cannabis use on the central nervous system , as reflected by alteration in  neuropsychological performance .  From the  40 articles that met criteria for inclusion in this  review , the authors could not detect consistent evidence for  persisting neuropsychological deficits  in  cannabis users ;  however , 22 of the 40 studies reported at least some subtle  impairments .  The inability to reach a firm conclusion results largely from method ological limitations inherent in most studies . These are considered in detail to inform future studies on ( nonacute ) consequences of cannabis consumption on cognitive abilities."
" : According to the published literature , the  clinimetric properties of  HAM-D6 are  superior  to  those  of both the  HAM-D17 and MADRS .  Since the validity of HAM-D6 has been demonstrated in both research and clinical practice , using the scale more consistently would facilitate translation of results from one setting to the other."
"dOBJECTIVE To identify which gait deviations are consistently associated with  knee osteoarthritis ( KOA )  and how these are influenced by disease severity , the involved compartment , and sex . METHODS Five electronic data bases and reference lists of publications were search ed .  Cross-sectional , observational studies  comparing   temporospatial variables  ,  joint kinematics  , and  joint moments   between  individuals with KOA and healthy controls or between KOA subgroups  were considered for review . Only publications  scoring  ≥50 % on a modified methodology quality index were included . Because of the number of gait deviations examined , only biomechanical variables reported by ≥4 publications were further analyzed . Where possible , a meta- analysis was performed using effect sizes ( ES ) calculated from discrete variables . RESULTS In total ,  41 publications examining 20 variables were included .  The majority of consistent  gait deviations  associated with KOA were exhibited by those with severe disease in the temporospatial domain . Individuals with severe KOA exhibited  greater stride duration  than controls ( ES 1.35 [ 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 1.03 , 1.67 ] ) and a  decrease in cadence  ( ES -0.75 [ 95 % CI -1.12 , -0.39 ] ) compared with controls . The evidence  for kinematic and joint moment change  was primarily limited or conflicting . There was a lack of evidence  for alterations in the external knee adduction moment  .   Individuals with KOA  exhibit a range of  gait  deviations compared with controls . Despite its common usage in KOA gait studies , we did not find consistent evidence  that knee adduction moment  differs between those with and without KOA or between disease severity levels . Further research examining the reasons for a lack of difference in many  gait variables  in those with knee OA is needed."
"hScreen  time  , but not overall  sedentary behaviour  , is consistently related to  cardiometabolic health in adolescents .  Because of the associations screen time has with dietary intake , diet may be an important factor in the screen time and health relationship ; however , evidence has not previously been synthesized . Thus , the aim of this systematic review was to explore whether the associations between various  sedentary behaviours  and  cardiometabolic risk markers  are independent of  dietary intake  in  adolescents .  Online data bases and personal libraries were search ed for peer- review ed original research articles published in English  before March 2014 .  Included studies assessed associations between  sedentary behaviour  and cardiometabolic markers in  12- to 18-year-olds and adjusted for  dietary intake .  Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria .  From the 21 studies examining  sedentary behaviour  and  adiposity  , the majority found significant positive associations between  television viewing , screen time and self-reported overall sedentary behaviour with markers of adiposity  , independent of dietary intake . No significant associations  between screen time with blood pressure and cholesterol  were reported . Sedentary  behaviour  appears to be associated with   adiposity  in adolescents  , irrespective of  dietary intake  . However , the variability of  dietary variables  between studies suggests further work is needed to underst and the role of   dietary intake   when examining these associations in youth."

"sBACKGROUND  Balance training  may be beneficial for  patients with osteoporosis  , although current results are inconclusive . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to explore the effect of  balance training  on  falls in patients with osteoporosis .  METHODS PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , EBSCO , and Cochrane Library data bases were systematic ally search ed . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) assessing the effect of  balance training vs usual activities  on falls in  patients with osteoporosis  were included . Two investigators independently search ed articles , extracted data , and assessed the quality of included studies . The primary outcome was  fall frequency .  This meta- analysis was performed using the fixed- or r and om-effect model when appropriate . RESULTS  Six RCTs were included in the systematic review and 3  in the meta-analyses . Compared with control groups , a  balance training intervention  was found to significantly reduce the  frequency of falls  ( risk ratio = 0.63 ; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 0.42 - 0.95 ; p = 0.03 ) in  patients with osteoporosis  , but demonstrated no remarkable influence on the results of the  Berg Balance Scale  ( mean difference -3.66 ; 95 % CI -12.04 - 4.72 ; p = 0.39 ) and  Timed Up and Go test  ( mean difference -1.79 ; 95 % CI -6.05 - 2.47 ; p = 0.41 ) .   Balance training  may significantly reduce the  frequency of falls  in patients with osteoporosis."
"sAims The aim of this systematic review was to report the  rate of dislocation  following the use of  dual mobility ( DM ) acetabular components  in  primary and revision  total hip  arthroplasty ( THA ) .  Material s and Methods A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta‐analyses guidelines was performed . A comprehensive search of Pubmed / Medline , Cochrane Library and Embase ( Scopus  )  was conducted  for English articles between January 1974 and March 2016  using various combinations of the keywords  “ dual mobility ” , “ dual‐mobility ”  ,  “ tripolar ” , “ double‐mobility ”  ,  “ double mobility ”  ,  “ hip ”  ,  “ cup  ” ,  “  socket ” . The following data were extracted by two investigators independently : demographics , whether the operation was a primary or revision THA , length of follow‐up , the design of the components , diameter of the femoral head , and type of fixation of the acetabular component . Results In all ,  59 articles met our inclusion criteria . These included a total of 17 908 THAs which  were divided into two groups : studies dealing with  DM components in primary THA  and those dealing with  these components  in  revision THA .   The mean rate of dislocation  was 0.9 % in the primary THA group , and 3.0 % in the revision THA group .  The mean rate of intraprosthetic dislocation  was 0.7 % in primary and 1.3 % in revision THAs . Conclusion Based on the current data , the  use of DM acetabular components  are effective in  minimising the risk of instability  after both primary and revision THA . This benefit must be balanced against continuing concerns about the additional modularity , and the new mode of failure  of intraprosthetic  dislocation . Longer term studies are needed to assess the function of these newer material s compared with previous generations."
"yBACKGROUND A variety of  antiarrhythmic drugs  have been used to prevent recurrence of  atrial  fibrillation  after conversion to sinus rhythm .  We performed a systematic review to determine the effect of long-term treatment with those drugs on  death , embolisms , adverse effects , and atrial fibrillation recurrence .  METHODS We search ed MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cochrane  Library ( all up to  May  2005 )  , and the reference lists of retrieved articles . We included  r and omized  controlled trials that compared any  antiarrhythmic  against  control ( placebo or no treatment )  or  another antiarrhythmic  , for more than 6 months .  Postoperative atrial fibrillation was excluded .  Two evaluators independently review ed the retrieved studies and extracted all data . Disagreements were resolved by discussion . All results were calculated at 1 year of follow-up . RESULTS  Forty-four trials were included , with a total of 11 322 patients .  Several class IA  ( disopyramide phosphate , quinidine sulfate )  , class IC  ( flecainide acetate , propafenone hydrochloride )  , and class III  ( amiodarone , dofetilide , sotalol hydrochloride )  drugs significantly reduced  recurrence of atrial fibrillation  ( number needed to treat , 2 - 9 ) , but all increased  withdrawals  due to  adverse effects  ( number needed to harm [ NNH ] , 9 - 27 ) and all but amiodarone and propafenone increased  proarrhythmia  ( NNH , 17 - 119 ) . Class IA drugs , pooled , were associated with increased  mortality  compared with controls ( Peto odds ratio , 2.39 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.03 - 5.59 ; P = .04 ; NNH , 109 ) . No other antiarrhythmic showed a significant effect on  mortality  compared with controls . We could not analyze other outcomes because data were lacking .  Class IA , IC , and III drugs are effective in  maintaining sinus rhythm  but increase  adverse effects  , and class IA drugs may increase mortality."
 The last 10 years has seen a substantial increase in the number of mapping studies and some evidence of advancement in methods with consideration of models beyond OLS and greater reporting of predictive ability of mapping functions.

"dBACKGROUND The effects of  vitamin D  on  fractures , falls , and bone mineral density  are uncertain , particularly for high  vitamin D  doses . We aim ed to determine the effect of  vitamin D supplementation  on  fractures , falls , and bone density .  METHODS In this systematic review , r and om-effects meta- analysis , and trial sequential analysis , we used findings from literature search es in previously published meta-analyses . We up date d these findings by search ing PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Central on Sept 14 , 2017 , and Feb 26 , 2018 , using the search term  "" vitamin D ""  and additional keywords , without any language restrictions . We assessed  r and omised controlled trials of adults ( > 18 years ) that compared  vitamin D with untreated controls , placebo , or lower-dose vitamin D supplements .   Trials with multiple interventions ( eg , co-administered calcium and vitamin D ) were eligible if the study groups differed only by  use of  vitamin D.   We excluded trials of hydroxylated vitamin D analogues . Eligible studies included outcome data for  total or hip fractures , falls , or bone mineral density  measured at the lumbar spine , total hip , femoral neck , total body , or forearm . We extracted data about participant characteristics , study design , interventions , outcomes , funding sources , and conflicts of interest . The co- primary endpoints were  participants with at least one fracture , at least one hip fracture , or at least one fall ;  we compared data for  fractures  and falls using relative risks with an intention-to-treat analysis using all available data . The secondary endpoints were the  percentage change in bone mineral density from baseline  at  lumbar spine , total hip , femoral neck , total body , and forearm  . FINDINGS We identified  81 r and omised controlled trials ( n=53 537 participants )  that reported  fracture  ( n=42  )  ,   falls  ( n=37  ) , or   bone mineral density   ( n=41 ) . In pooled  analyses , vitamin D  had no effect on  total fracture  ( 36 trials ; n=44 790 , relative risk 1·00 , 95 % CI 0·93 - 1·07 ) ,  hip fracture  ( 20 trials ; n=36 655 , 1·11 , 0·97 - 1·26 ) ,  or falls  ( 37 trials ; n=34 144 , 0·97 , 0·93 - 1·02 ) . Results were similar in r and omised controlled trials of high-dose  versus  low-dose  vitamin D  and in subgroup analyses of r and omised controlled trials using doses greater than 800 IU per day . In pooled analyses , there were no clinical ly relevant between-group differences  in bone mineral  density at any site ( range -0·16 % to 0·76 % over 1 - 5 years ) . For  total fracture and falls  , the effect estimate lay within the futility boundary for relative risks of 15 % , 10 % , 7·5 % , and 5 % ( total fracture only ) , suggesting  that vitamin D supplementation  does not reduce fractures or falls by these amounts . For  hip  fracture , at a 15 % relative risk , the effect estimate lay between the futility boundary and the inferior boundary , meaning there is reliable evidence  that vitamin D  supplementation does not reduce hip fractures by this amount , but uncertainty remains as to whether it might increase hip fractures . The effect estimate lay within the futility boundary at thresholds of 0·5 % for  total hip , forearm , and total body bone mineral density  , and 1·0 % for lumbar spine and femoral neck , providing reliable evidence  that  vitamin D does not alter these outcomes by these amounts . INTERPRETATION Our findings  suggest that vitamin D supplementation  does not prevent  fractures or falls  , or have clinical ly meaningful  effects on bone mineral density  . There were no differences between the effects of higher and lower doses  of vitamin D.  There is little justification to  use vitamin D supplements  to  maintain  or  improve musculoskeletal health  . This conclusion should be reflected in clinical guidelines .

"sOBJECTIVE To develop treatment recommendations for  children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis manifesting as non-systemic polyarthritis , sacroiliitis , or enthesitis .  METHODS The Patient/ Population , Intervention , Comparison , and Outcomes ( PICO ) questions were developed and refined by members of the guideline development teams . A systematic review was conducted to compile evidence for the benefits and harms associated with treatments for these conditions . GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence . A group consensus process was conducted among the Voting Panel to generate the final recommendations and grade their strength . A Parent and Patient Panel used a similar consensus approach to provide patient/caregiver preferences for key questions . RESULTS Thirty-nine recommendations were developed ( 8 strong and 31 conditional ) . The  quality of supporting evidence  was very low or low for 90 % of the recommendations . Recommendations are provided for the use of  nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs , disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs , biologics , and intraarticular and oral glucocorticoids .  Recommendations for the use of  physical and occupational therapy  are also provided . Specific recommendations for polyarthritis address general medication use , initial and subsequent treatment , and adjunctive therapies .  Good disease control  , with therapeutic escalation to achieve low  disease activity  , was recommended . The sacroiliitis and enthesitis recommendations primarily address  initial therapy  and adjunctive  therapies  .  This guideline provides direction for clinicians , caregivers , and patients making treatment decisions . Clinicians , caregivers , and patients should use a shared decision-making process that accounts for patients ' values , preferences , and comorbidities . These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies."
" We found low- quality evidence that different work-break frequencies may have no effect on participant-reported  musculoskeletal pain , discomfort and fatigue .  For productivity and work performance , evidence was of very low- quality that different work-break frequencies may have a positive effect . For different types of break , there may be no effect on participant-reported  musculoskeletal pain , discomfort and fatigue  according to low- quality evidence . Further high- quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of  frequency , duration and type of  work-break   interventions among workers , if possible , with much higher sample sizes than the studies included in the current review . Furthermore ,  work-break interventions  should be reconsidered , taking into account worker population s other than office workers , and taking into account the possibility of  combining work-break intervention  with other  interventions  such as  ergonomic training or counselling  , which may may possibly have an effect on musculoskeletal outcomes and work performance."
"dOBJECTIVE . This systematic review addresses the effectiveness of  occupational therapy – related interventions  for  adults with fibromyalgia .  METHOD . We examined the literature  published between January 2000 and June 2014 .  A total of  322 abstract s from five data bases  were review ed .  Forty-two Level I studies  met the inclusion criteria . Studies were evaluated primarily with regard to the following outcomes :  daily activities , pain , depressive symptoms , fatigue , and sleep .  RESULTS . Strong evidence was found for interventions categorized for this review as   cognitive – behavioral interventions ; relaxation and stress management ; emotional disclosure ;  physical activity  ;   and   multidisciplinary interventions  for improving daily living , pain , depressive symptoms , and fatigue .  There was limited to no evidence for self-management , and few interventions result ed in  better sleep .   . Although the evidence supports interventions within the scope of  occupational therapy  practice for  people with fibromyalgia  , few interventions were occupation based."

"nIn the present review , we argue that  social disconnectedness  could and should be included in primary -care screening protocol s for the detection of cardiometabolic disease . Empirical evidence indicates that weak social connectedness represents a serious risk factor for chronic diseases , including cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and various cancers . Weak social connectedness , however , is largely regarded as a second-tier health-risk factor in clinical and research setting s. This may be because the mechanisms by which this factor impacts on physical health are poorly understood . Budding research , however , advances the idea that social connectedness buffers against stress-related allostatic load-a known precursor for cardiovascular disease and cancer . The present paper review s the empirical knowledge on the relationship between  everyday stress  ,  social connectedness  , and allostatic load . Of  6022 articles retained in the literature search , 20 met predefined inclusion criteria .  These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that  social connectedness  correlates negatively with  allostatic load .  Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including  gender , social status , and quality of social ties .  More research into these factors , however , is warranted to conclusively determine their significance . The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience  chronic stress and associated allostatic load .  The negative association between  social connectedness and various chronic diseases  can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load . We argue that assessing  social  connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention."
" Observational evidence that  light-intensity PA  can confer health benefits is accumulating .  Currently inactive or insufficiently active people  should be encouraged to engage in  PA  of any intensity .

"PPURPOSE The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of increasing  dietary linoleic acid ( LA )  intake on the  blood concentrations  of inflammatory  markers  including cytokines , acute phase reactants and adhesion molecules in  adults .  METHODS We comprehensively search ed PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Library for eligible studies . Overall ,  30 r and omized controlled studies involving 1377 subjects were included  for  meta- analysis  . RESULTS No significant effect of higher  LA  intake was observed for cytokines  : tumor necrosis factor  ( SMD : -0.01 ; 95 % CI : -0.19 to 0.17 ) ,  interleukin-6  ( SMD : 0.11 , 95 % CI : -0.07 to 0.29 ) ,  adiponectin  ( SMD : 0.17 , 95 % CI : -0.17 to 0.50 ) and  monocyte chemoattractant protein 1  ( SMD : 0.14 , 95 % CI : -0.33 to 0.60 ) . Pooled effect size from 16 studies showed that the  C-reactive protein ( CRP ) concentration  was not significantly affected by increasing  LA  intake ( SMD = 0.09 , 95 % CI : -0.05 to 0.24 ) . However , subgroup and meta-regression analysis suggested that in subjects with a more profound increase of dietary  LA  intake  ,  LA might increase the  blood CRP level .  Other  acute phase reactants including fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and adhesion molecules  were not significantly changed when  LA  was increased in diet . No significant heterogeneity or publication bias was observed , although only a limited number of eligible studies were included for some markers .  Our meta- analysis suggested that increasing dietary  LA  intake does not have a significant effect on the  blood concentrations of inflammatory markers .  However , the extent of change in  dietary LA  intake might affect the effect of  LA  supplementation on CRP."

"sBackground :  Duloxetine hydrochloride ( DUL )  is an antidepressant included in the pharmacological class of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder , generalized anxiety disorder , diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain , fibromyalgia , and chronic musculoskeletal pain . The aim of this review was to eluci date current evidence s on the use of  DUL  in the treatment of a variety of  psychiatric disorders .  Methods : This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ) guidelines . PubMed  data  base was search ed  from January 1 , 2003 , to September 30 , 2018  , using  11 key terms related to psychiatric disorders ( "" persistent depressive disorder , "" "" dysthymic disorder , "" "" bipolar disorder , "" "" seasonal affective disorder , "" "" obsessive-compulsive disorder , "" "" social phobia , "" "" panic disorder , "" "" posttraumatic stress disorder , "" "" schizophrenia , "" "" eating disorders , "" "" sexual disorders , "" "" personality disorders "" )  and one key term related to  duloxetine ( "" duloxetine hydrochloride "" ) .  Article titles and abstract s were scanned to determine relevance to the topic . For additional studies , the authors also examined the reference lists of several of the included papers . Results :  Duloxetine  may be an  effective treatment for mood spectrum disorders , panic disorder  , several  symptom clusters  of  borderline personality  , and as add-on drug in  schizophrenia .  Modest or conflicting results have been found for the  efficacy of duloxetine in obsessive-compulsive disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder , eating , and sexual disorders .  Conclusion : Major limitations of the review ed studies were short trial duration , small sample sizes , and the lack of control groups . Defining the potential role of  DUL  in the treatment of psychiatric disorders other than  major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder  needs further r and omized , placebo-controlled studies."
" Campaigns and interventions have the potential to exacerbate socio-economic inequalities in folic acid use . One way of addressing this is to include elements that specifically target  vulnerable women .  To achieve and maintain an effect , they need to be based on good health promotion practice and to be sustained over a long period . However , even high- quality campaigns that increase use result in under half of women in the target group taking supplements."

"sObjectives Sarcopenia , defined as an age-associated loss of skeletal muscle function and muscle mass , occurs in approximately 6 - 22 % of  older adults .  This paper presents evidence -based clinical practice guidelines for screening , diagnosis and management of sarcopenia from the task force of the  International Conference  on  Sarcopenia  and  Frailty Research ( ICSFR )  . Methods To develop the guidelines , we drew upon the best available evidence from two systematic review s paired with consensus statements by international working groups on sarcopenia . Eight topics were selected for the recommendations : ( i ) defining sarcopenia ; ( ii ) screening and diagnosis  ;  ( iii )  physical activity prescription ; ( iv ) protein supplementation ; ( v ) vitamin D supplementation ; ( vi ) anabolic hormone prescription ; ( vii ) medications under development ;  and ( viii )  research .  The ICSFR task force evaluated the evidence behind each topic including the  quality of evidence , the benefitharm balance of treatment , patient preferences/values , and cost-effectiveness .  Recommendations were grade d as either strong or conditional ( weak ) as per the GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) approach . Consensus was achieved via one face-to-face workshop and a modified Delphi process . Recommendations We make a conditional recommendation for the use of an internationally accepted measurement tool for the diagnosis of sarcopenia including the EWGSOP and FNIH definitions , and advocate for rapid screening using  gait speed  or the  SARC-F.  To treat sarcopenia , we strongly recommend the  prescription of resistance-based physical activity  , and conditionally recommend  protein supplementation/a protein-rich diet .  No recommendation is given for  Vitamin D supplementation  or for  anabolic hormone prescription .  There is a lack of robust evidence to assess the strength of other treatment options."
"sSupporting positive change in lifestyle behaviours is a priority in tackling the health inequalities experienced by  adults with intellectual disabilities .  In this systematic review , we examine the evidence on the definition , measurement and epidemiology of sedentary behaviour of  adults with intellectual disabilities .  A systematic literature search of PUBMED , EMBASE , MEDLINE and Google Scholar was performed to identify  studies published from 1990 up to October 2015 . Nineteen papers met  the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review . Many research ers do not distinguish between insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviour . None of the studies reported the reliability and validity of the methods used to measure  sedentary behaviour . Sedentary time  , assessed objective ly , ranged from 522 to 643min/day : higher than in adults without intellectual disabilities . This first-ever review of sedentary behaviour and intellectual disabilities found that at present the evidence base is weak . Studies calibrating  accelerometer data  with criterion measures for  sedentary behaviour  are needed to determine specific cut-off points to measure  sedentary behaviour  in adults with intellectual disabilities . Research ers should also examine the reliability and validity of using  proxy-report  question naires to measure  sedentary behaviour  in this group . A better underst and ing of  sedentary behaviour  will inform the design of novel interventions to change lifestyle behaviours of adults with intellectual disabilities."
"gOBJECTIVE To review the existing human controlled intervention studies of  vitamin D  as adjunctive therapy in setting  s of infection  and provide recommendations for design and implementation of future studies in this field on the basis of the evidence review ed . METHODS We conducted a systematic review of r and omized controlled clinical trials that studied  vitamin D  for treatment or prevention of  infectious diseases in humans . Studies from 1948 through 2009 were  identified through search terms in PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE . RESULTS  Thirteen published controlled trials  were identified by our search criteria . Ten trials were  placebo  controlled , and 9 of the 10 were conducted in a rigorous double-blind design . The selected clinical trials demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in baseline patient demographics , sample size , and vitamin D intervention strategies .  Serious adverse events  attributable to vitamin D supplementation were rare across all studies . On the basis of studies review ed to date , the strongest evidence supports further research into adjunctive  vitamin D therapy  for tuberculosis , influenza , and viral upper respiratory tract illnesses . In the selected studies , certain aspects of study design are highlighted to help guide future clinical research in the field .  More rigorously design ed clinical trials are needed for further evaluation of the relationship between vitamin D status and the immune  response  to infection as well as for delineation of necessary changes in clinical practice and medical care of patients with vitamin D deficiency in infectious disease setting."
"6Background Corruption is the abuse or complicity in abuse , of public or private position , power or authority to benefit oneself , a group , an organisation or others close to oneself ; where the benefits may be financial , material or non- material . It is wide-spread in the health sector and represents a major problem . Objectives Our primary objective was to systematic ally summarise empirical evidence of the effects of strategies to reduce corruption in the  health  sector . Our secondary objective was to describe the range of strategies that have been tried and to guide future evaluations of promising strategies for which there is insufficient evidence . Search methods We search ed  14 electronic data bases up to January 2014 , including : CENTRAL ; MEDLINE ; EMBASE ; sociological , economic , political and other health data bases ; Human Re sources Abstract s up to November 2010 ; Euroethics up to August 2015 ; and PubMed alerts from January 2014 to June 2016 .  We search ed another  23 websites and online data bases for grey literature up to August 2015  , including the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the U4 Anti-Corruption Re source Centre , Transparency International , healthcare anti-fraud association websites and trial registries . We conducted citation search es in Science Citation Index and Google Scholar , and search ed PubMed for related articles up to August 2015 . We contacted corruption research ers in December 2015 , and screened reference lists of articles up to May 2016 . Selection criteria For the primary analysis , we included r and omised trials , non-r and omised trials , interrupted time series studies and controlled before-after studies that evaluated the effects of an intervention to reduce corruption in the health sector . For the secondary analysis , we included case studies that clearly described an intervention to reduce corruption in the health sector , addressed either our primary or secondary objective , and stated the methods that the study authors used to collect and analyse data . Data collection and analysis One review author extracted data from the included studies and a second review author checked the extracted data against the reports of the included studies . We undertook a structured synthesis of the findings . We constructed a results table and ' Summaries of findings ' tables . We used the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach  to  assess  the certainty of the evidence . Main results No studies met the inclusion criteria of the primary analysis . We included  nine  studies that met the inclusion criteria for the secondary analysis . One study found that a package of interventions coordinated by the US Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Justice  recovered a large amount of money  and result ed in hundreds of  new cases  and convictions each year ( high certainty of the evidence ) . Another study from the USA found that establishment of an independent agency to investigate and enforce efforts against overbilling might lead to a small reduction in  overbilling  , but the certainty of this evidence was very low . A third study from  India  suggested that the impacts of coordinated efforts to reduce  corruption  through increased detection and enforcement are dependent on continued political support and that they can be limited by a dysfunctional judicial system ( very low certainty of the evidence ) . One  study in South Korea and two in the USA  evaluated increased efforts to investigate and punish  corruption  in  clinics and hospitals  without establishing an independent agency to coordinate these efforts . It is unclear whether these were effective because the evidence is of very low certainty . One study from  Kyrgyzstan  suggested that increased transparency and accountability for co-payments together with reduction of incentives for dem and ing informal payments may reduce  informal payments  ( low certainty of the evidence ) . One study from  Germany  suggested that guidelines that prohibit hospital doctors from accepting any form of benefits from the pharmaceutical industry may improve  doctors ' attitudes  about the influence of pharmaceutical companies on their choice of medicines ( low certainty of the evidence ) . A study in the USA , evaluated the effects of introducing a  law  that required pharmaceutical companies to report the gifts they gave to healthcare workers . Another study in the USA evaluated the effects of a variety of  internal control mechanisms used by community health centres to stop  corruption   . The effects of these strategies is unclear because the evidence was of very low certainty . Authors ' conclusions There is a paucity of evidence regarding how best to reduce  corruption .  Promising interventions include improvements in the   detection and punishment of corruption   , especially efforts that are coordinated by an independent agency . Other promising interventions include guidelines that prohibit doctors from accepting benefits from the pharmaceutical industry , internal control practice s in community health centres , and increased transparency and accountability for co-payments combined with reduced incentives for informal payments . The extent to which increased transparency alone reduces  corruption  is uncertain . There is a need to monitor and evaluate the impacts of all interventions to reduce  corruption  , including their potential adverse effects . Interventions to reduce  corruption  in the  health sector  What is the aim of this review ? The aim of this Cochrane review is to assess the effectiveness of strategies to reduce  corruption  in the  health sector .  Cochrane research ers search ed for all potentially relevant studies , and found nine studies that met their criteria . Key messages The review suggests that some strategies to fight corruption in the health sector can have an effect on  corruption .  These strategies include the use of  independent agencies  to investigate and  punish corruption  , telling  healthcare workers  that they are not allowed to accept payments from pharmaceutical companies , ensuring that information about healthcare prices is clear and accessible to the public together with increasing healthcare worker salaries . However , the certainty of this evidence varies . We need more high- quality studies that assess the effects of these and other strategies . What was studied in the review ? Corruption can occur in any area of the health sector , and happens when people abuse their own position to benefit themselves , their organisation , or other people close to them . It can take many forms , including bribes , theft , or giving incorrect or inaccurate information deliberately . Healthcare officials , for instance , may steal healthcare funds , hospital administrators may change patient records to increase hospital payments , doctors may accept bribes from pharmaceutical companies in exchange for using their products , and patients may try to bribe hospital staff to avoid treatment queues . Corruption affects the health sector in many ways . It can take money away from healthcare , lead to poorer quality care and make access to healthcare unfair , and often affects poor people the hardest . What are the main results of the review ? The review authors included nine relevant studies that used different strategies to  stop corruption .  • In a study from the  USA  ,  efforts  to  investigate and punish corruption in the health sector  were also increased . An independent agency at the national level coordinated these efforts , which led to convictions and the recovery of large amounts of money ( high certainty evidence ) . These efforts may also have led to  substantial savings  to the government ( low certainty evidence ) . In another study from the USA establishment of an independent agency to investigate and enforce  efforts  against  overbilling  was established , but the effects of these efforts are unclear because the evidence was of very low certainty . In  India  , there were efforts to  stop corruption  through the appointment of an ombudsman in one state . However , the effect of this strategy is unclear because the evidence was of very low certainty . • In one study in  South Korea  and  two in the USA  ,  efforts to investigate and punish corruption in clinics and hospitals  were increased , without establishing an independent agency . However , it is unclear whether these were effective because the evidence is of very low certainty . • In a study in  Kyrgyzstan  , the government carried out a number of strategies , including  giving patients  and  the public information  about how much they should be paying , and increasing healthcare workers ' salaries . This study shows that these strategies may have led to fewer  patients giving their doctors informal payments  ( low certainty evidence ) . • In a  study in Germany  ,  hospital doctors  were given guidelines telling them that they were not allowed to accept  money  or  gifts from pharmaceutical companies .  The study suggests that this may have changed  doctors '  attitudes about the influence of pharmaceutical companies on their choice of medicines ( low certainty evidence ) . • In one  study in the USA  , the authorities introduced a law that required pharmaceutical companies to report the gifts they gave to healthcare workers . In another  USA-based study  , community health centres attempted to  stop corruption  using a variety of internal control mechanisms . However , the effect of these strategies is unclear because the evidence was of very low certainty . We do n't know what the effects of these strategies have on  healthcare or people 's health  , or if these strategies had any harmful effects . This is because the studies only assessed the effects of the strategies on  corruption  and the use of re sources , or because the evidence was of very low certainty . How up to date is this review ? The review authors search ed for studies that had been published up to 06 June 2016."
"MAlthough the regular consumption of  resveratrol  has been known to improve glucose homeostasis and reverse insulin resistance in  type 2 diabetes mellitus  (  T2DM  ) , the reported results are inconsistent . Thus , we aim ed to assess the effects of  resveratrol  on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity among  patients with T2DM .  We search ed for relevant articles published until June 2017 on PubMed - Medline , Embase , Cochrane Library , and Web of Science .  R and omized controlled trials in T2DM patients administered with  resveratrol  as intervention  were included . After study selection , quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two authors , and STATA and RevMan software were used for statistical analysis .  Nine r and omized controlled trials involving 283 participants were included .  Meta- analysis showed  that resveratrol  significantly improved  the fasting plasma glucose  ( −0.29 mmol/l , 95 % CI : −0.51 , −0.06 , p <  0.01 ) and insulin levels  ( −0.64 U/mL , 95 % CI : −0.95 , −0.32 , p < 0.0001 ) . The drug  also reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) index , systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure  among participants with T2DM .  The changes in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  were negligible . Subgroup analysis  comparing the resveratrol  supplementation doses of < 100 mg/d versus ≥ 100 mg/d revealed a significant difference  in fasting plasma glucose  . In particular , the latter dose presented more favorable results . This meta- analysis provides evidence  that supplementation of resveratrol  may benefit management of T2DM."
"sAbstract Introduction : Numerous eHealth tools for pain assessment and management have been developed and evaluated with promising results regarding psychometric properties , efficacy , and effectiveness . Although considerable re sources are spent on developing and evaluating these tools with the aim of increasing access to care , current evidence suggests they are not made available to end users , reducing their impact and creating potential research waste . Methods : This study consisted of 2 components : ( 1 ) a systematic  review  of   eHealth tools  for pediatric pain assessment and /or management  published in the past 10 years , and ( 2 ) an  online survey  ,  completed by the authors of identified tools , of tool availability  ,  perceived barriers or  facilitators to availability , grant funding used , and a vali date d measure of user-centeredness of the design process ( UCD-11 ) . Results :  Ninety articles ( 0.86 % of citations screened ) describing 53 tools met inclusion criteria .  Twenty-six survey responses were completed ( 49.06 % ) , 13 of which ( 50.00 % ) described available tools . Commonly endorsed facilitators of tool availability included research ers ' beliefs in tool benefits to the target population and research community ; barriers included lack of  infrastructure  and  time .  The  average cost  of each unavailable tool was $ 314,425.31 USD ( $ 3,144,253.06 USD total , n = 10 ) . Authors of available tools were more likely to have followed user-centered design principles and reported  higher total funding .  Conclusion : Systemic changes to academic and funding structures could better support eHealth tool availability and may reduce potential for research waste . User-centered design and implementation science methods could improve the availability of eHealth tools and should be further explored in future studies."
"sPurpose  Physical exercise  has been shown to be an effective , safe , and quite inexpensive method to reduce cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors and is currently in the process of establishing its relevance for cancer specific morbidity and mortality . The aim of this systematic review was to focus on specific effects of  resistance exercise ( RE )  in the adjuvant therapy and rehabilitation of  prostate cancer patients ( PCaPs ) receiving or having received  and rogen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) .   Methods A systematic literature search focusing on  relevant and peer- review ed studies published between 1966 and September 2014  ,  using PubMed , EMBASE , MEDLINE , SCOPUS  ,  and Cochrane Library data bases  , was conducted . Results The majority of studies demonstrated RE as an  effective and safe  intervention to  improve muscular strength and performance , fatigue and quality of life ( QoL )  in PCaPs , while there is inconclusive evidence concerning  cardiovascular performance , body composition , blood lipids , bone mineral density ( BMD ) , and immune response .  Conclusion Existing evidence leads to the conclusion that  RE  seems to be a  safe  intervention in PCaPs with beneficial effects on  physical performance capacity  and  QoL.  Nevertheless , further research in this field is urgently needed to increase underst and ing of exercise interventions in PCaPs."
" PRT results in  improvements to muscle strength and some aspects of functional limitation  ,  such as gait speed  , in  older adults  . However , based on current data , the effect of PRT on  physical disability  remains unclear . Further , due to the poor reporting of adverse events in trials , it is difficult to evaluate the risks associated with PRT."
">Background The increasing prevalence of  type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )  can have a substantial impact in  low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) .   Community-based programs addressing diet , physical activity , and health behaviors  have shown significant benefits on the prevention and management of T2DM , mainly in  high-income countries  . However , their effects on preventing T2DM in the  at-risk population of LMICs  have not been thoroughly evaluated . Methods The Cochrane Library ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE and two clinical trial registries were search ed to identify eligible studies . We applied a 10 years limit ( from 01 Jan 2008 to 06 Mar 2018 ) on English language literature . We included r and  omized   controlled trials  (  RCTs  )  with programs focused on lifestyle changes such as  weight loss  and /or  physical  activity increase , without pharmacological treatments  , which aim ed to alter incidence of diabetes or one of the T2DM risk factors , of at least 6 months duration based on follow-up , conducted in  LMICs .  Results  Six RCTs r and omizing 2574 people were included .  The  risk of developing diabetes  in the intervention groups reduced more than 40 % , RR ( 0.57 [ 0.30 , 1.06 ] ) , for 1921  participants  ( moderate quality evidence ) , though it was not statistically significant . Significant  differences were observed in weight , body mass index , and waist circumference change  in favor  of  community-based programs from baseline , ( MD [ 95 % CI ] ; − 2.30 [ − 3.40 , − 1.19 ] , p < 0.01 , I2 = 87 % ) , ( MD [ 95 % CI ] ; − 1.27 [ − 2.10 , − 0.44 ] , p < 0.01 , I2 = 96 % ) , and ( MD [ 95 % CI ] ; − 1.66 [ − 3.17 , − 0.15 ] , p = 0.03 , I2 = 95 % ) , respectively . The pooled effect showed a  significant reduction in fasting blood glucose and HbA1C measurements  in favor of the intervention ( MD [ 95 % CI ] ; − 4.94 [ − 8.33 , − 1.55 ] , p < 0.01 , I2 = 62 % ) , ( MD [ 95 % CI ] ; − 1.17 [ − 1.51 , − 0.82 ] , p < 0.01 , I2 = 46 % ) ,  respectively  .  No significant difference was observed in 2-h blood glucose values  ,  systolic or diastolic blood pressure  change between the two groups . Conclusion Based on available literature , evidence suggests that  community-based interventions  may reduce the  incidence rate of T2DM  and may positively affect  anthropometric indices and HbA1C .  Due to the heterogeneity observed between trials we recommend more well- design ed RCTs with longer follow-up duration s be executed , to confirm whether  community-based interventions  lead to reduced  T2DM events  in the  at-risk population of LMIC setting ."
"sPURPOSE To provide recommendations on appropriate use of breast tumor biomarker assay results to guide decisions on  adjuvant systemic therapy  for  women with early-stage invasive breast cancer .  METHODS A literature search and prospect ively defined study selection sought systematic review s , meta-analyses , r and omized controlled trials , prospect ive-retrospective studies , and prospect i ve comparative observational studies published from 2006 through  2014 .  Outcomes of interest included  overall survival and disease-free or recurrence-free survival .  Expert panel members used informal consensus to develop evidence -based guideline recommendations . RESULTS The literature search identified  50 relevant studies .  One r and omized clinical trial and  18  prospect  ive-retrospective  studies were found to have evaluated the clinical utility , as defined by the guideline , of specific biomarkers for guiding decisions on the need for  adjuvant systemic therapy .  No studies that met guideline criteria for clinical utility were found to guide choice of specific treatments or regimens . RECOMMENDATIONS In addition to estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 , the panel found sufficient evidence of clinical utility for the biomarker assays Oncotype DX , EndoPredict , PAM50 , Breast Cancer Index , and urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 in specific subgroups of breast cancer . No  biomarker  except for  estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  was found to guide choices of specific treatment regimens . Treatment decisions should also consider disease stage , comorbidities , and patient preferences."

" There is uncertainty whether current strategies for providing  CVD risk scores   affect  CVD events . Providing  CVD risk scores  may slightly  reduce CVD risk factor levels  and may  increase preventive medication  prescribing in higher-risk people without evidence of harm . There were multiple study limitations in the identified studies and substantial heterogeneity in the interventions , outcomes , and analyses , so readers should interpret results with caution . New models for implementing and evaluating CVD risk scores in adequately powered studies are needed to define the role of applying CVD risk scores in primary CVD prevention."

"sDue to the positive effects demonstrated in r and omized clinical trials on cardiovascular surrogate markers and bone metabolism , a positive effect of  growth hormone ( GH ) treatment  on clinical ly relevant end-points seems feasible . In this review , we discuss the  long-term efficacy and safety  of  GH treatment  in  adult patients with growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) with emphasis on  morbidity : fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and stroke , fractures , fatal and nonfatal malignancies and recurrences , and diabetes mellitus .   A positive effect of  GH  treatment on  CVD and fracture risk  could be concluded , but study design limitations have to be considered .  Stroke  and  secondary brain tumours  remained more prevalent . However , other contributing factors have to be taken into account .  Regrowth and recurrences of (peri)pituitary tumours  were not increased in patients with  GH  treatment compared to similar patients without  GH treatment .  All  fatal and nonfatal malignancies  were not more prevalent in   GH-treated  adults  compared to the general population . However , follow-up time is still relatively short . The studies on diabetes are difficult to interpret , and more evidence is awaited . In clinical practice , a more individualized assessment seems appropriate , taking into consideration the underlying diagnosis of GHD , other treatment regimens , metabolic profile and the additional beneficial effects of GH set against the possible risks . Large and thoroughly conducted observational studies are needed and seem the only feasible way to inform the ongoing debate on health care costs , drug safety and clinical outcomes."
"rNootropics represent probably the first "" smart drugs "" used for the treatment of  cognitive deficits .  The aim of this paper is to verify , by a systematic analysis of the literature , the effectiveness of  nootropics  in this indication . The analysis was limited to  nootropics  with cholinergic activity , in view of the role played by acetylcholine in learning and memory . Acetylcholine was the first neurotransmitter identified in the history of neuroscience and is the main neurotransmitter of the peripheral , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . We conducted a systematic review of the literature for  the 5-year period 2006 - 2011 .  From the data reported in the literature , it emerges that  nootropics  may be an effective alternative for  strengthening and enhancing cognitive performance  in  patients with a range of pathologies .  Although  nootropics  , and specifically the cholinergic precursors , already have a long history behind them , according to recent renewal of interest , they still seem to have a significant therapeutic role . Drugs with regulatory indications for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , such as  cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine  , often have  transient effects in dementia disorders .   Nootropics  with a cholinergic profile and documented  clinical effectiveness  in combination with cognate drugs such as  cholinesterase inhibitors  or alone in patients who are not suitable for these inhibitors should be taken into account and evaluated further."
 There is ' gold ' level evidence ( www.cochranemsk.org ) that  supervised aerobic exercise training  has beneficial  effects on physical capacity and FMS symptoms .   Strength training  may also have  benefits  on  some FMS symptoms .  Further studies on muscle strengthening and flexibility are needed . Research on the long-term benefit of  exercise  for  FMS  is needed.
",Background : Enhanced recovery following surgery can be achieved through the introduction of  evidence -based perioperative maneuvers .  This review aims to present a consensus for optimal perioperative management of  patients undergoing  breast reconstructive surgery   and to provide evidence -based recommendations for an enhanced perioperative protocol . Methods : A systematic review of meta-analyses , r and omized controlled trials , and large prospect i  ve  cohorts was conducted for each protocol element . Smaller prospect i ve cohorts and retrospective cohorts were considered only when higher level evidence was unavailable . The available literature was grade d by an international panel of experts in breast reconstructive surgery and used to form consensus recommendations for each topic . Each recommendation was grade d following a consensus discussion among the expert panel . Development of these recommendations was endorsed by the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Society . Results : High- quality r and omized controlled trial data in  patients undergoing breast reconstruction  informed some of the recommendations ; however , for most items , data from lower level studies in the population of interest were considered along with extrapolated data from high- quality studies in non – breast reconstruction population s. Recommendations were developed for a total of 18 unique enhanced recovery after surgery items and are discussed in the article . Key recommendations support use of   opioid-sparing perioperative medications   , minimal  preoperative fasting  and  early feeding  , use  of anesthetic techniques that decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain  ,  use of measures to prevent intraoperative hypothermia  , and  support of early mobilization after surgery .  Conclusion : Based on the best available evidence for each topic , a consensus review of optimal  perioperative care  for  patients undergoing breast reconstruction  is presented . CLINICAL QUESTION /LEVEL OF EVIDENCE : Therapeutic ,."
"rGhrelin is a hormone with multiple physiologic functions , including promotion of growth hormone release , stimulation of appetite and regulation of energy homeostasis . Treatment with  ghrelin/ghrelin-receptor agonists  is a prospect i ve therapy for disease-related cachexia and malnutrition . In vitro studies have shown high expression of ghrelin in cancer tissue , although its role including its impact in cancer risk and progression has not been established . We performed a systematic literature review to identify peer-  review  ed  human or animal in vivo original research  studies of  ghrelin ,  ghrelin-receptor agonists   , or  ghrelin genetic variants and  the  risk  , presence , or growth of  cancer  using structured search es in PubMed data base as well as secondary search es of article reference lists , additional review s and meta-analyses . Overall , 45 ( 73.8 % ) of the 61 studies review ed , including all 11 involving  exogenous ghrelin/ghrelin-receptor agonist treatment  , reported either a null ( no statistically significant difference ) or inverse association of  ghrelin/ghrelin-receptor  agonists or ghrelin genetic  variants  with  cancer risk  ,  presence or growth ;  10 ( 16.7 % ) studies reported positive associations ; and 6 ( 10.0 % ) reported both negative or null and positive associations .  Differences in serum ghrelin levels in  cancer cases vs controls ( typically lower ) were reported for some but not all cancers . The majority of in vivo studies showed a  null or inverse association of ghrelin  with risk and progression of most cancers , suggesting that  ghrelin/ghrelin-receptor agonist  treatment may have a favorable safety profile to use for cancer cachexia . Additional large-scale prospect i ve clinical trials as well as basic bioscientific research are warranted to further evaluate the  safety and benefits  of  ghrelin  treatment in patients with cancer."
" Large variations were observed in  mean nonheme-iron absorption  ( 0.7 - 22.9 % ) between studies , which depended on iron status ( diet had a greater effect at low serum and plasma ferritin concentrations ) and dietary enhancers and inhibitors .  Iron  absorption was predicted from serum ferritin concentrations and dietary modifiers by using a regression equation . Extrapolation of these findings to developing countries and to  men and women of different  ages will require additional high- quality controlled trials."
"eBackground Prolonged sitting has been associated with  musculoskeletal dysfunction .  For  desk workers  ,  workstation modifications  frequently address the work surface and chair . Chairs which can prevent abnormal strain of the neuromuscular system may aid in preventing  musculo-skeletal pain and discomfort .  Anecdotally , adjustability of the seat height and the seat pan depth to match the anthropometrics of the user is the most commonly recommended intervention . Within the constraints of the current economic climate , employers dem and evidence for the benefits attributed to an investment in altering workstations , however this evidence -base is currently unclear both in terms of the strength of the evidence and the nature of the chair features . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of  chair interventions  in reducing  workplace musculoskeletal symptoms .  Methods Pubmed , Cinahl , Pedro , ProQuest , SCOPUS and PhysioFocus were search ed .  ‘ Ergonomic intervention ’  ,  ‘ chair ’  ,  ‘ musculoskeletal symptoms ’  ,  ‘ ergonomics ’  ,  ‘ seated work ’  were used in all the data bases . Articles were included if they investigated the influence of  chair modifications  as an intervention ;  participants were in predominantly seated occupations ;  employed  a pre/post design  ( with or without  control  or   r   and omising ) and if the outcome measure included neuro-musculoskeletal comfort and /or postural alignment . The risk of bias was assessed using a tool based on The Cochrane H and book . Results  Five studies were included  in  the review . The number of participants varied from 4 to 293 participants .  Three of the five studies were R and omised Controlled Trials , one pre and post-test study was conducted and one single case , multiple baselines ( ABAB ) study was done . Three studies were conducted in a  garment factory  ,  one in an office environment and one with university students .  All five studies found a reduction in  self-reported musculoskeletal pain  immediately after the intervention . Bias was introduced due to poor r and omization procedures and lack of concealed allocation . Meta- analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the data ( differing population , intervention and outcomes across studies ) . Conclusion The findings of this review indicate a consistent trend that supports the role of  a chair intervention  to reduce  musculoskeletal symptoms  among  workers who are required to sit for prolonged periods .  However the amount , level and quality of the evidence are only moderate therefore we can not make strong recommendations until further trials are conducted . The review also highlights gaps : for example in showing whether the effectiveness of  a chair intervention  has long-term impact , particularly with respect to musculoskeletal symptoms , as well as the recurrence  of symptoms  and the consequent cost of care."

"dBACKGROUND Surgery remains the best curative option for  appropriately selected patients with lung cancer .  Evidence suggests that improving cardiovascular fitness and functional capacity can accelerate post-surgery recovery and reduce mortality . However , the effect of  exercise intervention  for  patients surgically treated for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer [ NCSLC ]  has not been fully examined . PURPOSE This review examines the literature regarding  exercise intervention  for  patients who are surgically treated for NSCLC  focussing on three key areas : method ological quality , intervention design ( e.g. duration , frequency , type ) and outcomes measured . METHODS A search of Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL and PsychINFO was undertaken . R and omised Controlled Trials [ RCTs ] and non- RCTs including  exercise training  pre or post  lung cancer resection  were included . Descriptive characteristics were extracted and method ological quality assessed using Downs and Black appraisal checklist . RESULTS  Twenty studies ( eight RCT 's )  were included : nine pre-surgical , nine post-surgical and two pre to post-surgical . The quality of evidence is question able with many limitations ( e.g. small sample s , inadequate allocation concealment and a lack of clear reporting on timing , adverse events and follow-up ) . Regarding design of  exercise intervention  and outcomes measured , there was much variation between studies producing a disparate set of data . An optimal programme is still to be determined ; however , suggestions are made relating to type of exercise ( i.e.  mixing aerobic , resistance and breathing exercises )  . Preliminary work from this review suggests that  exercise intervention  compared with  usual care  both pre and post-surgery is associated with  improved cardiopulmonary exercise capacity , increased muscle strength and reduced fatigue , post-operative complications and hospital length of stay .  Results concerning  pulmonary function , quality of life , and blood gas analysis  were variable and inconsistent .  In order to implement  exercise intervention  appropriate for  patients surgically treated  for  NCSLC  , more high quality r and omised controlled trials are required and more work concerning feasibility , acceptability and effectiveness of specific interventions on outcomes is warranted."
"g& NA ;  Orlistat  , an inhibitor of intestinal lipase , promotes  body  weight reduction . The lipid‐lowering efficacy of  orlistat  is controversial and the effect of  orlistat‐induced  body weight reduction on lipid changes has not been explored in meta‐regression analyses . A systematic literature search was conducted to identify r and omized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of  orlistat  on plasma  total , low‐density lipoprotein and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides and lipoprotein(a )  levels .  Thirty‐three studies were included in the meta‐ analysis ( 5522 and 4210 participants in  the orlistat  therapy and control groups , respectively )   . Orlistat   reduced body weight  ( weighted mean difference : −2.12 , p < 0.001 )  , total‐cholesterol  ( weighted mean difference : −0.30 mmol/L , p <  0.001  )  , low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( weighted mean difference : −0.27 mmol/L , p <  0.001 ) , high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( weighted mean difference : −0.034 mmol/L , p < 0.001 )  and triglyceride  ( weighted mean difference : −0.09 mmol/L , p < 0.001 ) concentrations , while no effect on lipoprotein(a ) was observed  . Total‐ and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol‐lowering  were associated negatively with  duration of orlistat  treatment and positively with  body  weight  changes  . In  conclusion , Orlistat  treatment slightly  reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels  ,  but not lipoprotein(a ) levels . Total‐ and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  reductions are more consistent in patients with greater body weight reduction and shorter  duration of orlistat  treatment . Graphical abstract Figure . No caption available .  HighlightsOrlistat  is an inhibitor of intestinal lipase promoting  body weight reduction  , but whose lipid‐lowering efficacy is controversial . We investigated the efficacy  of orlistat  on  plasma lipids and body weight  in a  meta‐ analysis of 33 studies including 9732   participants  .Orlistat   was associated with a slight but significant decrease  in body weight , plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations  ,  whereas plasma  Lp(a ) levels were  not affected by orlistat  treatment .  Greater body weight reduction  and lower  duration of orlistat  treatment promoted more consistent plasma total‐ and LDL‐cholesterol lowering."
"sBackground : Muscle weakness is the main cause of motor impairment among  stroke survivors  and is associated with reduced peak muscle torque . Objective : To systematic ally investigate and organize the evidence of the reliability of  muscle strength evaluation measures  in  post-stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis .  Data Sources : Two assessors independently search ed  four  electronic data bases in January 2014 ( Medline , Scielo , CINAHL , Embase ) . Study Selection : Inclusion criteria comprised studies on reliability on  muscle strength assessment  in  adult post-stroke patients with chronic hemiparesis .  Data Extraction : We extracted outcomes from included studies about  reliability  data , measured by intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) and /or similar . The meta-analyses were conducted only with isokinetic data . Results :  Of 450 articles , eight articles were included  for this review . After quality analysis , two studies were considered of high quality . Five different joints were analyzed within the included studies ( knee , hip , ankle , shoulder , and elbow ) . Their  reliability  results varying from low to very  high reliability  ( ICCs from 0.48 to 0.99 ) . Results of meta- analysis for  knee extension  varying from high to  very high reliability  ( pooled ICCs from 0.89 to 0.97 ) , for  knee flexion  varying from high to  very high reliability  ( pooled ICCs from 0.84 to 0.91 ) and for  ankle plantar flexion  showed  high reliability  ( pooled ICC = 0.85 ) . Conclusion :   Objective muscle strength assessment   can be reliably used in lower and upper extremities in post-stroke patients with chronic hemiparesis."
"7BACKGROUND Evidence from controlled trials encourages the intake of  dietary pulses ( beans , chickpeas , lentils  and  peas )  as a method of improving dyslipidemia , but heart health guidelines have stopped short of ascribing specific benefits to this type of intervention or have grade d the beneficial evidence as low . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to assess the effect of  dietary pulse intake  on established therapeutic lipid targets for cardiovascular risk reduction . METHODS We search ed electronic data bases  and bibliographies of selected trials for relevant articles published through Feb. 5 , 2014 .  We included  RCTs of at least 3 weeks ' duration that  compared a   diet  emphasizing dietary pulse intake with an isocaloric diet that did not include dietary pulses .  The lipid targets investigated were  low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol  , apolipoprotein B and  non-high-density lipoprotein ( non-HDL ) cholesterol  . We pooled data using a r and om-effects model . RESULTS We identified  26 RCTs ( n = 1037 ) that  satisfied the inclusion criteria . Diets  emphasizing dietary  pulse intake at a median dose of 130 g/d ( about 1 serving daily ) significantly  lowered LDL cholesterol levels  compared with the control diets ( mean difference -0.17 mmol/L , 95 % confidence interval -0.25 to -0.09 mmol/L ) . Treatment effects on  apolipoprotein B and non-HDL cholesterol  were not observed . INTERPRETATION Our findings suggest that  dietary  pulse intake significantly  reduces LDL cholesterol levels .  Trials of longer duration and higher quality are needed to verify these results . TRIAL REGISTRATION Clinical Trials.gov , no. NCT01594567."
"sBackground  Synbiotics , probiotics or prebiotics  are being added to infant formula to promote growth and development in  infants .  Previous review s ( 2007 to 2011 ) on  term infants  given  probiotics or prebiotics  focused on prevention of allergic disease and food hypersensitivity . This review focused on growth and clinical outcomes in  term infants fed only infant formula containing  synbiotics , probiotics or prebiotics .   Methods Cochrane methodology was followed using r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) which compared  term infant formula  containing  probiotics , prebiotics or synbiotics to conventional infant formula with / without placebo  among  healthy full term infants .  The  mean difference ( MD )  and corresponding 95 %  confidence intervals  ( CI ) were reported for continuous outcomes , risk ratio ( RR ) and corresponding 95 % CI for dichotomous outcomes . Where appropriate , meta- analysis was performed ; heterogeneity was explored using subgroup and sensitivity analyses . If studies were too diverse a narrative synthesis was provided . Results  Three  synbiotic  studies ( N = 475 ) , 10  probiotics  studies ( N = 933 ) and 12  prebiotics  studies ( N = 1563 ) were included .   Synbiotics  failed to significantly increase  growth  in boys and girls . Use of  synbiotics  increased  stool frequency  , had  no impact  on  stool consistency , colic , spitting up / regurgitation , crying , restlessness or vomiting .  Probiotics in formula also failed to have any significant effect on  growth , stool frequency or consistency .  Probiotics did not lower the  incidence of diarrhoea , colic , spitting up / regurgitation , crying , restlessness or vomiting .   Prebiotics  in formula did increase  weight gain  but had no impact on  length or head circumference gain .   Prebiotics  increased  stool frequency  but had no impact on  stool consistency , the incidence of colic , spitting up / regurgitation , crying , restlessness or vomiting .  There was no impact of  prebiotics  on the  volume of formula tolerated , infections and gastrointestinal microflora .  The quality of evidence was compromised by imprecision , inconsistency of results , use of different study preparations and publication bias . Authors ’ conclusions There is not enough evidence to state that supplementation of  term infant formula  with  synbiotics , probiotics or prebiotics  does result in improved growth or clinical outcomes in  term infants .  There is no data available to establish if  synbiotics  are superior to probiotics or prebiotics."

"nPurpose  Cerebrospinal fluid shunt infection  is associated with patient morbidity and high cost . We conducted a systematic review of the current evidence of comprehensive surgical protocol s or individual interventions design ed to reduce  shunt infection  incidence . Methods A systematic review using PubMed and SCOPUS identified studies evaluating the effect of a particular intervention on  shunt infection risk  . Systemic  prophylactic antibiotic  or  antibiotic-impregnated shunt efficacy  studies were excluded . A  total of 7429 articles were screened and 23 articles were included .  Results Eight studies evaluated the effect of comprehensive surgical protocol s.  Shunt infection  was reduced in all studies ( absolute risk reduction 2.2–12.3 % ) . Level of evidence was low ( level 4 in seven studies ) due to the use of historical controls . Compliance ranged from 24.6 to 74.5 % . Surgical scrub with  antiseptic  foam and omission of a 5 %  chlorhexidine gluconate  preoperative hair wash were both associated with increased  shunt infection .  Twelve studies evaluated the effect of a single intervention . Only  antibiotic-impregnated suture  , a no-shave policy , and double gloving with glove change prior to shunt h and ling , were associated with a significant reduction  in shunt infection .  In a  hospital with high methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) prevalence  , a r and omized controlled trial found that perioperative vancomycin rather than cefazolin significantly reduced  shunt infection rates  . Conclusion Despite wide variation in compliance rates , the implementation of comprehensive surgical protocol s reduced  shunt infection  in all published studies .  Antibiotic-impregnated suture  , a no-shave policy , double gloving with glove change prior to device manipulation , and 5 %  chlorhexidine  hair wash were associated with significant reductions in shunt infection."
"gBACKGROUND In the process of conducting a systematic review on interventions for  skin lesions due to neuritis in leprosy  , we assessed several primary papers with respect to the quality of reporting and methods used in the studies . Awareness of what constitutes weak points in previously conducted studies may be used to improve the planning , conducting and reporting of future clinical trials . AIMS To assess the  quality of reporting and of  methodology   in studies of  interventions  for  skin lesions due to neuritis in leprosy .  METHODS Items of importance for preventing selection bias , detection bias , attrition bias and performance bias were among items assessed . The items for assessing method ological  quality  were used as a basis for making the checklist to assess the  quality  of reporting . RESULTS Out of the  854 references that we inspected eight studies were included on the basis of the inclusion criteria .  The interventions tested were  dressings , topical agents and footwear  and in all studies  healing of ulcers  was the main outcome measure . Reporting of both , methods and results suffered from underreporting and disorganization . The most under-reported items were concealment of allocation , blinding of patients and outcome assessors , intention to treat and  validation of outcomes .   There is an apparent need to improve the method ological quality as well as the quality of reporting of trials in  leprosy ulcer treatment .  The most important threat in existing studies is the threat of selection bias . For the reporting of future studies , journals could promote and encourage the use of the CONSORT statement checklist by expecting and requiring that authors adhere to it in their reporting."

" The  quantity  and especially  quality  of  data  are low . Analysis shows a reduction in  overall complications  , but major complications were not reduced .  Length of stay  was reduced significantly . We state that ERAS seems safe , but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify implementation of ERAS as the st and ard of care . Within ERAS protocol s included , no answer regarding the role for  minimally invasive surgery ( i.e. laparoscopy )  was found . Furthermore , protocol compliance within ERAS programs has not been investigated , while this seems a known problem in the field . Therefore , more specific and large RCT 's are needed."

"ePurpose of review This systematic review reports the most recent literature regarding the effects of  physical exercise  on   muscle strength  ,  body composition , physical functioning and inflammation  in older adults .  All articles were assessed for method ological quality and where possible effect size was calculated . Recent findings  Thirty-four articles were included – four involving frail , 24 healthy and five older adults with a specific disease .  One reported on both  frail and nonfrail patients .  Several types  of exercise  were used :  resistance training , aerobic training , combined resistance training and aerobic training  and others . In  frail older persons  , moderate-to-large beneficial exercise effects were noted on  inflammation , muscle strength and physical functioning .  In healthy older persons , effects of  resistance training  ( most frequently investigated ) on  inflammation or muscle strength  can be influenced by the  exercise  modalities ( intensity and rest interval between sets ) .  Muscle strength  seemed the most frequently used outcome measure , with moderate-to-large effects obtained regardless the exercise intervention studied . Similar effects were found in  patients with  specific diseases .  Summary Exercise  has moderate-to-large effects on  muscle strength , body composition , physical functioning and inflammation  in  older adults .  Future studies should focus on the influence of specific  exercise  modalities and target the  frail population  more."
"eBackground In the light of demographic developments  health promotion interventions  for  older people  are gaining importance . In addition to method ological challenges arising from the economic evaluation of  health promotion interventions  in general , there are specific method ological problems for the particular target  group  of  older people .  There are especially four main method ological challenges that are discussed in the literature . They concern  measurement and valuation of informal caregiving , accounting for productivity costs , effects of unrelated cost in added life years  and the  inclusion of ‘ beyond-health ’ benefits .  This paper focuses on the question whether and to what extent specific method ological requirements are actually met in applied health economic evaluations . Methods Following a systematic review of pertinent health economic evaluations , the included studies are analysed on the basis of four assessment criteria that are derived from method ological debates on the economic evaluation of  health promotion interventions  in general and economic evaluations targeting  older people  in particular . Results Of the 37 studies included in the systematic review , only very few include  cost and outcome categories  discussed as being of specific relevance to the assessment of health promotion interventions for  older people  . The few studies that consider these aspects use very heterogeneous methods , thus there is no common method ological st and ard . Conclusion There is a strong need for the development of guidelines to achieve better comparability and to include  cost categories and outcomes  that are relevant for  older people  . Disregarding these method ological obstacles could implicitly lead to discrimination against the elderly in terms of health promotion and disease prevention and , hence , an age-based rationing of public health care."
"eGender differences in substance use/abuse have been the focus of research in the last 15 years . Initiation , use patterns , acceleration of disease course , and help-seeking patterns are known to be influenced by gender differences with regard to biological , psychological , cultural and socioeconomic factors . This paper presents a systematic review of published data on gender differences in the use/abuse of  psychoactive and psychotic drugs  , focusing on the importance of a multidisciplinary approach . The basis for this paper was obtained by  Medline search  es using the search terms ""  human  ""   and  ""  gender  ""  , combined with individual drug names or  ""  drugs of  abuse ""  . The reference lists of these papers were further checked for other relevant studies . The gender difference in  drug abuse  is more evident in  adults than  in  adolescents ( 13 - 19 years ) : adult men  are 2 - 3 times more likely than  women  to develop  drug abuse/dependence disorders  and approximately 4 times as likely to have an  alcohol use disorder .  Such prevalence rates have not been observed in  adolescents .  Differences between men and women involve : ( i ) the  biological response to the drug  , ( ii ) the  progression to drug dependence  , and ( iii ) the  comorbid psychiatric diagnoses  , which may be due to both sociocultural factors and innate biological differences . A crucial role played by ovarian hormones ( oestrogens and progesterone ) has been documented in both human and animal model studies . Epidemiological data on how particular psychobiological and physiological characteristics in females influence  vulnerability to  both  drug addiction and toxicological consequences of drugs  are still in their infancy . Significant gaps remain in our knowledge , which are primarily attributable to the lack of empirical data that only a systematic and multidisciplinary approach to the topic can generate . The introduction of gender into forensic toxicological evaluations may help eluci date the relationship between the  body 's absorption of abused drugs  ( alone or in combination ) and the  onset of intoxications  , both  lethal  and none."
" Although financial incentives are considered an important element in strategies to change prescribing patterns , limited evidence of their effects can be found . Effects of policies , including  pay for performance policies  , in improving  quality of care and health outcomes  remain uncertain . Because pharmaceutical policies have uncertain effects , and because they might cause harm as well as benefit , proper evaluation of these policies is needed . Future studies should consider the impact of these policies on  health outcomes , drug use and overall healthcare expenditures , as  well as on drug expenditures."

"dBACKGROUND The objective of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to determine the effects of  omega-3 supplementation  on adipocytokine levels in  adult prediabetic and diabetic individuals .  METHODS We search ed PubMed , Medline , EMBASE , Scopus , Web of Science , Google Scholar , Cochrane Trial Register , World Health Organization Clinical Trial Registry Platform , and Clinical trial.gov Registry from inception to August 1 , 2017 for r and omized controlled trials . Pooled effects of interventions were assessed as mean difference using r and om effects model . We conducted a sensitivity , publication bias and subgroup analysis . RESULTS  Fourteen studies individuals ( n=685 ) were included in the meta- analysis  .  Omega-3 supplementation  increased  levels of adiponectin  ( 0.48 μg/mL ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.27 to 0.68 ; P<0.00001 , n=10 trials ) , but effects disappeared after sensitivity analysis  . Tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF-α ) levels  were reduced ( -1.71 ; 95 % CI , -3.38 to -0.14 ; P=0.03 , n=8 trials ) . Treatment duration shorter than 12 weeks was associated with greater reduction than longer treatment duration  . Levels of other adipocytokines  were not significantly affected . Publication bias could generally not be excluded .   Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation  may  increase  adiponectin and  reduce TNF-α levels  in this population group . However , due to overall study heterogeneity and potential publication bias , a cautious interpretation is needed."
"tAims Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) is a major care problem worldwide .  Tadalafil and sildenafil  are the two most common phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors used to treat ED . This systematic review and meta- analysis were conducted to directly compare  tadalafil  with  sildenafil  for the treatment of ED . Methods We design ed a strategy for search ing the PubMed , Embase , EBSCO , Web of Science and Cochrane library data bases ; the reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated . A literature review was performed to identify all published r and  omized or non-r  and  omized  controlled trials that compared  tadalafil  with  sildenafil  for the treatment of ED and to assess the quality of the studies . Two investigators independently and blindly screened the studies for inclusion . The meta- analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0 . Results A total of  16 trials  that compared  tadalafil  with  sildenafil  for the treatment of ED were included in the meta- analysis . In the meta- analysis ,  tadalafil  and  sildenafil  appeared to have similar  efficacies and overall adverse event rates .  However , compared with  sildenafil , tadalafil  significantly improved  psychological outcomes .  Furthermore , the patients and their partners preferred  tadalafil  over  sildenafil  , and no significant difference was found in  the adherence and persistence rates  between  tadalafil  and sildenafil . Additionally ,  the myalgia and back pain rates  were higher and the  flushing rate  was lower with  tadalafil  than with sildenafil . Conclusion  Tadalafil  shares a similar  efficacy and safety  with  sildenafil  and significantly improves  patients ’ sexual confidence  . Furthermore ,  patients  and their  partners  prefer  tadalafil  to sildenafil . Hence ,  tadalafil  may be a better choice for ED treatment."

"nABSTRACT Data about harms or benefits associated with the consumption of  aspartame  , a nonnutritive sweetener worldwide consumed , are still controversial . This systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled clinical trials aim ed to assess the effect of  aspartame  consumption on   metabolic parameters  related to diabetes and obesity .  The search was performed on Cochrane , LILACS , PubMed , SCOPUS , Web of Science data bases , and on a gray literature using Open Grey , Google Scholar , and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global . Search es across all data bases were conducted from the earliest available date up to April 13 , 2016 , without date and language restrictions .  Pooled mean differences  were calculated using a r and om or fixed-effects model for heterogeneous and homogenous studies , respectively .  Twenty-nine articles  were included in qualitative synthesis and twelve , presenting numeric results , were used in meta- analysis  . Fasting blood glucose ( mmol/L ) , insulin levels ( μU/mL ) , total cholesterol ( mmol/L ) , triglycerides concentrations ( mmol/L ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( mmol/L  ) , body weight  ( kg  ) , and energy intake  ( MJ ) were considered as the main outcomes in subjects that  consumed aspartame  , and results were presented as mean difference ; % confidence interval , range  . Aspartame  consumption was not associated with alterations  on blood glucose levels  compared to control ( −0.03 mmol/L ; 95 % CI , −0.21 to 0.14 ) or to sucrose ( 0.31 mmol/L ; 95 % CI , −0.05 to 0.67 ) and  on  insulin  levels  compared to control ( 0.13 μU/mL ; 95 % CI , −0.69 to 0.95 ) or to sucrose ( 2.54 μU/mL ; 95 % CI , −6.29  to 11.37 ) . Total cholesterol  was not  affected  by aspartame consumption compared to control ( −0.02 mmol/L ; 95 % CI , −0.31 to 0.27 ) or to sucrose ( −0.24 mmol/L ; 95 % CI  , −0.89 to 0.42 ) . Triglycerides  concentrations were not affected by aspartame consumption compared to control ( 0.00 mmol/L ; 95 % CI , −0.04 to 0.05 ) or to sucrose ( 0.00 mmol/L ; 95 %  CI , −0.09 to 0.09 ) . High-density lipoprotein cholesterol  serum levels were higher  on  aspartame compared to control ( −0.03 mmol/L ;  95  % CI , −0.06 to −0.01 ) and lower on  aspartame  compared to sucrose ( 0.05 mmol/L ; 95 % CI , 0.02 to 0.09  ) . Body weight  did not change after  aspartame  consumption compared to control ( 5.00 kg ; 95 % CI , −1.56 to 11.56 ) or to sucrose ( 3.78 kg ; 95 % CI , −2.18 to  9.74 ) . Energy intake  was not altered by  aspartame  consumption compared to control ( −0.49 MJ ; 95 % CI , −1.21 to 0.22 ) or to sucrose ( −0.17 MJ ; 95 % CI , −2.03 to 1.69  )  .

"sPURPOSE To up date the 2006 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on the use of  hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors ( CSFs ) .  METHODS The American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Up date Committee and conducted a systematic review of r and omized clinical trials , meta-analyses , and systematic review s from October 2005 through September 2014 . Guideline recommendations were based on the review of the evidence by the Up date Committee . RESULTS Changes to previous recommendations include the addition of tbo-filgrastim and filgrastim-sndz , moderation of the recommendation regarding routine use of  CSFs  in  older patients with diffuse aggressive  lymphoma , and addition of recommendations against routine  dose-dense chemotherapy  in lymphoma and in favor of  high-dose-intensity chemotherapy  in urothelial cancer . The Up date Committee did not address recommendations regarding use of  CSFs  in  acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in adults .  RECOMMENDATIONS Prophylactic use  of CSFs  to reduce the risk of  febrile neutropenia  is warranted when the risk of  febrile neutropenia  is approximately 20 % or higher and no other equally effective and safe regimen that does not require CSFs is available . Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of  febrile neutropenia  in  patients who are at high risk on  the basis  of age ,  medical history , disease characteristics , and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy  regimen  . Dose-dense regimens that  require CSFs  should only be used within an appropriately design ed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data . Current recommendations for the management of  patients  exposed to lethal doses of total-body radiotherapy , but not doses high enough to lead to certain death as a result of injury to other organs , include the prompt administration of CSFs."

A search of the gray literature was performed in Google Scholar and OpenGrey . Reference lists of eligible studies were evaluated to identify additional studies . Two authors assessed studies for inclusion and extracted the data . In vitro studies that evaluated  permanent human teeth fractured by trauma  were included . RESULTS Twenty-one  studies  remained after screening . The  bond strength between the fragment and the crown  was evaluated in  119 experimental groups .  Ten different techniques were evaluated as follows :  no preparation  ,  chamfer  , bevel , anchors , overcontour , internal  groove  ,  no preparation  associated with chamfer after reattachment , fragment  dentin removal  associated with  chamfer  after reattachment , bevel associated with overcontour , and groove associated with shoulder . Five different material s were used to reattach the fragment : bonding system , luting composite resin , flowable composite , microhybrid composite , and nanocomposite .   Fragment reattachment  using a technique with no preparation and an adhesive system associated with an intermediate composite with good mechanical properties can restore part of the resistance of the fractured tooth."
"sBACKGROUND It is commonly assumed that  patients with chronic low back pain  are less active than healthy  individuals  . There has been a recent increase in the number of studies published comparing the physical activity levels of  patients with chronic low back pain and healthy individuals .  OBJECTIVES The aim of this systematic review was to determine , based on the current body of evidence , if  patients with chronic low back pain  have a lower level and /or altered pattern of physical activity compared with asymptomatic , healthy individuals . DATA SOURCES The electronic data bases Embase , Medline , ISI Web of Knowledge , Cinahl , Sport Discus and Nursing and Allied Health were search ed from the beginning of each data base until the end of December 2009 . REVIEW METHODS Studies which compared the level and /or  pattern  of physical activity   of  patients with chronic low back pain and healthy controls  were included . The quality of the included studies was assessed using an assessment tool based on the  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale .  The scale was modified for the purpose s of this study . RESULTS  Seven studies  were included in the final review .  Four studies recruited adult patients ( 18 - 65 years ) , two studies examined older adults ( ≥65 years ) and one study recruited adolescents ( < 18 years ) .  Pooled data revealed no significant difference in  the overall activity level  of  adults or adolescents with CLBP  , however there is evidence that older adults with chronic low back pain are less active than controls . The results suggest that patients exhibit an  altered pattern of physical activity  over the course of a day compared to controls . Major method ological limitations were identified and are discussed .  There is no conclusive evidence that  patients with chronic low back pain  are less active than healthy individuals . Based on a limited number of studies , there is some evidence that the distribution of activities over the course of a day is different between patients with chronic low back pain and controls."

" The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding  preterm infants   with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .  The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with  protein  hydrolysate affects the  risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .  Further large , pragmatic trials are needed to provide more reliable and precise estimates of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness."
">There has been a growing interest in the role of  vitamin E supplementation  in the treatment and /or prevention of  nonalcoholic fatty liver ( NAFLD ) .  We performed a systematic review of the medical literature from inception through  15  June 2018 by utilizing PubMed and search ing for key terms such as NAFLD ,  vitamin  E , alpha-tocopherol , and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Data from studies and medical literature focusing on the role of  vitamin E  therapy in  patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH )  were review ed . Most studies assessing the impact of  vitamin E  in NAFLD were design ed to evaluate  patients with NASH with documented biochemical and histological abnormalities .  These studies demonstrated improvement in  biochemical profiles  , with a decline in or normalization of  liver enzymes .  Furthermore ,  histological assessment  showed favorable outcomes in  lobular inflammation and hepatic steatosis  following treatment with  vitamin E.  Current guidelines regarding the use of  vitamin E  in the setting of NAFLD recommend that  vitamin E-based  treatment be restricted to biopsy-proven nondiabetic patients with NASH only . However , some concerns have been raised regarding the use of  vitamin E  in patients with NASH due to its  adverse effects profile  and lack of significant  improvement  in  hepatic fibrosis .  In conclusion , the  antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and anti-apoptotic properties  of  vitamin E  accompanied by ease-of-use and  exceptional tolerability  have made  vitamin E  a pragmatic therapeutic choice in  non-diabetic patients with histologic evidence of NASH .  Future clinical trials with study design to assess  vitamin E  in combination with other anti-fibrotic agents may yield an additive or synergistic  therapeutic effect ."

"sFinancial  incentive interventions  are increasingly used as a method of encouraging healthy behaviours , from attending for vaccinations to taking part in regular physical activity . There is a growing body of research on the effectiveness of  financial incentive interventions  for health behaviours . Wide variations in the nature of these interventions make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about what makes an effective incentive , for whom and under what circumstances . Whilst there has been some recognition of the theoretical complexity of  financial incentive interventions  for health behaviours , there is no framework that categorises these interventions . This limits the research community 's ability to clearly establish which components of  financial incentives interventions  are more and less effective , and how these components might interact to enable behavioural change . We propose a framework for describing  health-promoting financial incentive interventions .  Drawing on our experience of a recently completed systematic review , we identify nine domains that are required to describe any  financial incentive intervention  design ed to help  individuals  change their health behaviours . These are :  direction , form , magnitude , certainty , target , frequency , immediacy , schedule and recipient .  Our framework should help research ers and policy-makers identify the most effective  incentive configurations  for helping individuals adopt healthy behaviours."
"dOBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term clinical performance of  direct versus indirect composite inlays/onlays   in posterior teeth .  DATA Screening for inclusion eligibility , quality assessment of studies and data extraction was performed independently by two authors . SOURCES The electronic data bases MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Oral Health Group 's Trials Register and CENTRAL were search ed  ( 14.12.2015 )  , with no restriction to publication date or language . We included  only r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs )  and evaluated them according to Cochrane risk of bias tool . The main outcome assessed was the  restoration failure  , determined by several clinical parameters . STUDY SELECTION  Two studies concerning  direct and indirect inlays  ( 82 patients with 248 restorations ) and one study for  onlays  ( 157 patients with 176 restorations ) satisfied  the inclusion  criteria  . Two trials , one of unclear and one of high risk of bias , could be mathematically combined . The meta- analysis indicated no statistically significant difference in the  risk failure  between   direct  and indirect inlays  , after 5 years ( RR : 1.54 ; 95 % Cl : 0.42 , 5.58 ; p=0.52 ) or 11 years of function ( RR : 0.95 ; 95 % Cl : 0.34 , 2.63 ; p=0.92 ) . Only one parameter , the  marginal discoloration  , slightly favored  direct inlays  after 11 years ( RR : 0.41 ; 95 % Cl : 0.17 , 0.96 ; p=0.04 ) . Only one study dealt with  onlays ;  an overall  5-year survival  of 87 % ( 95 % CI : 81 - 93 % ) was reported .  The difference of the two techniques did not reach statistical significance in order to recommend one technique over the other . The scarcity of primary studies support the need for further well- design ed long-term studies in order to reach firm conclusions about both techniques . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE  Resin composite material s  , placed directly or indirectly , exhibit a promising  long-term clinical performance  when rehabilitation of  posterior teeth  is needed . Although many years in clinical practice , the selection of the best treatment protocol still remains subjective . The available studies , and their synthesis , can not provide reliable evidence in this field."
"sINTRODUCTION  Probiotics  are a complementary and integrative therapy useful in the treatment and prevention of  urogenital infections in women .  This study extends the work of research ers who systematic ally investigated the scientific literature on probiotics to prevent or treat  urogenital infections .  METHODS A systematic review was conducted to determine the efficacy of  probiotics  for prevention and /or treatment of  urogenital infections in adult women from January 1 , 2008 , through June 30 , 2015 .  We search ed in CINAHL , MEDLINE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Web of Science , Dissertations and Theses , and Alt-HealthWatch . After removing duplicates and  studies that did  not  meet  inclusion criteria  , 20 studies were review ed .  All included at least one species of  Lactobacillus probiotic  as an intervention for treatment or prevention of urogenital infections . Data extracted included sample s , setting s , study design s , intervention types , reported outcomes , follow-up periods , and results . We evaluated all r and omized controlled trials for risk of bias and made quality appraisal s on all studies . RESULTS Fourteen of the studies focused on bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) , 3 on urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) , 2 on vulvovaginal c and idiasis , and one on human papillomavirus ( HPV ) as identified on Papanicolaou test . Studies were heterogeneous in terms of design , intervention , and outcomes . Four studies were of good quality , 9 of fair , and 7 poor .  Probiotic interventions  were  effective for treatment and prevention of BV , prevention of recurrences of c and idiasis and UTIs , and clearing HPV lesions .  No study reported  significant adverse events  related to the  probiotic intervention  . DISCUSSION The quality of the studies in this systematic review varied . Although clinical practice recommendations were limited by the strength of evidence ,  probiotic interventions  were effective in treatment and prevention of urogenital infections as alternatives or co-treatments . More good quality research is needed to strengthen the body of evidence needed for application by clinicians."

"kA summary of systematic review s and meta-analyses addressing the benefits and risks of  dietary  protein intakes   for   bone health  in adults  suggests that  dietary protein  levels even above the current RDA may be beneficial in reducing  bone loss and hip fracture risk  , provided calcium intakes are adequate . Several systematic review s and meta-analyses have addressed the benefits and risks of  dietary protein intakes  for  bone health in adults .  This narrative review of the literature summarizes and synthesizes recent systematic review s and meta-analyses and highlights key messages . Adequate supplies of dietary protein are required for optimal bone growth and maintenance of healthy bone . Variation in protein intakes within the “ normal ” range accounts for 2–4 % of BMD variance in  adults . In older people with osteoporosis  , higher protein intake ( ≥ 0.8-g/kg body weight/day , i.e. , above the current RDA ) is associated with  higher BMD  , a  slower rate of bone loss  , and  reduced risk of hip fracture  , provided that dietary calcium intakes are adequate . Intervention  with  dietary protein supplements  attenuate age-related BMD decrease and reduce bone turnover marker levels  , together  with an increase in IGF-I and a decrease in PTH .  There is no evidence that diet-derived acid load is  deleterious for bone health  . Thus , insufficient  dietary protein  intakes may be a more severe problem than protein excess in the elderly . Long-term , well-controlled r and omized trials are required to further assess the influence of  dietary protein  intakes  on fracture  risk."
">Background / Objectives We performed this systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate effects of  probiotics  on inflammation , uremic toxins , and gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms in  end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patients .  Methods A literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Cochrane Data base from inception through October 2017 . We included studies that assessed assessing effects of  probiotics  on inflammatory markers , protein-bound uremic toxins ( PBUTs ) , and GI symptoms in  ESRD patients on dialysis .  Effect estimates from the individual study were extracted and combined utilizing r and om effect , generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird . The protocol for this meta- analysis is registered with PROSPERO ; No. CRD42017082137 . Results  Seven clinical trials with 178 ESRD patients were enrolled .  There was a significant reduction  in serum C-reactive protein ( CRP )  from baseline to post-probiotic course ( ≥ 2 months after treatment ) with st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) of − 0.42 ( 95 % CI − 0.68 to − 0.16 , p = 0.002 ) . When compared to control , patients who received probiotics also had a significant higher degree of  reduction in CRP level  with SMDs of − 0.37 ( 95 % CI − 0.72 to 0.03 , p = 0.04 ) . However , there were no significant  changes in serum TNF-alpha or albumin  with SMDs of − 0.32 ( 95 % CI − 0.92 to 0.28 , p = 0.29 ) and 0.16 ( 95 % CI − 0.20 to 0.53 , p = 0.39 ) , respectively . After probiotic course , there were also significant  decrease in PBUTs  and  improvement in overall GI symptoms  ( reduction in GI symptom scores ) with SMDs of − 0.61 ( 95 % CI − 1.16 to − 0.07 , p = 0.03 ) and − 1.04 ( 95 % CI − 1.70 to − 0.38 , p = 0.002 ) , respectively . Conclusion Our study demonstrates potential beneficial effects of probiotics on inflammation , uremic toxins , and GI Symptoms in  ESRD patients .  Future large-scale clinical studies are required to assess its benefits on other important clinical outcomes  including patient mortality ."
"nThis paper is a systematic review of scientific papers that studied   postpartum weight retention .   The identification of the studies was conducted in the Medline , Lilacs and Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations data bases between 2000 until 2013 . The main information evaluated was : author , year of publication , sample size , year of data collection , losses and  analysis thereof  ,  age  ,  follow-up time  ,  weight in the baseline and in the postpartum  ,  assessment  methods of  weight retention  and main results .  Twenty studies were selected , of which 25 % ( n = 5 ) were national .  Regarding the mode of analysis , in some works the result was analyzed in different ways as continuous and categorical . Of the selected papers , 45 % ( n = 9 ) analyzed the  retained weight only  continuously , 5 % ( n = 1 ) only categorically and 40 % ( n = 8) both ways . One of the studies used  distribution in percentiles  and the other evaluated continuously , categorical and by  indicators of absolute and relative weight reduction .  In conclusion , the results found reveal a lack of well-defined information about the forms of  anthropometric measurements  of  women after delivery  , indicating the need for developing national proposals , consistent with the reality of our population."

"nUrinary  iodine concentration (  UIC ( μg/ml ) from spot urine sample s collected from  school-aged children  is used to determine the iodine status of  population s.  Some studies further extrapolate UIC to represent daily iodine intake , based on the assumption that children pass approximately 1 L urine over 24-h , but this has never been assessed in population studies . Therefore , the present review aim ed to collate and produce an estimate of the average  24-h urine volume  of  children and adolescents ( > 1 year and < 19 years )  from published studies . EBSCOHOST and EMBASE data bases were search ed to identify  studies which reported  the   mean 24-h urinary volume  of healthy children ( > 1 year and < 19 years ) .  The overall mean ( 95 % CI ) estimate of  24-h urine volume  was determined using a r and om effects model , broken down by age group . Of the  44 studies identified  , a meta- analysis of 27 studies , with at least one criterion for assessing the completeness of urine collection s , indicated that the mean  urine  volume of 2–19 year olds was 773 ( 654 , 893 ) ( 95 % CI ) mL/24-h . When broken down by age group , mean ( 95 % CI )  24-h urine volume  was 531 mL/day ( 454 , 607 ) for 2–5 year olds , 771 mL/day ( 734 , 808 ) for 6–12 year olds , and 1067 mL/day ( 855 , 1279 ) for 13–19 year olds . These results demonstrate that the  average urine  volume of  children aged 2–12 years  is less than 1 L , therefore , misclassification of iodine intakes may occur when urine volumes fall below or above 1 L. Future studies utilizing spot urine sample s to assess iodine status should consider this when extrapolating UIC to represent iodine intakes of a population."
"rIncreasing evidence indicates a relationship between   cannabis  use and  psychosis risk .   Specific factors , such as determinants of  cannabis  use or the genetic profile of cannabis users , appear to moderate this association . The present systematic review presents a detailed and up-to- date literature overview on factors that influence the relationship between  cannabis use and  psychosis risk .   A systematic search was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines in MEDLINE and Embase , and  56 studies were included .  The results show that , in particular , frequent  cannabis  use , especially daily use , and the consumption of high-potency cannabis are associated with a higher  risk of developing psychosis .  Moreover , several genotypes moderate the impact of cannabis use on  psychosis risk  , particularly those involved in the dopamine function , such as AKT1 . Finally , cannabis use is associated with an  earlier psychosis onset  and  increased risk of transition  in individuals at a clinical  high risk of psychosis  . These findings indicate that changing  cannabis  use behavior could be a harm reduction strategy employed to lower the  risk of developing psychosis .  Future research should aim to further develop specific biomarkers and genetic profiles for psychosis , thereby contributing to the identification of individuals at the highest risk of developing a psychotic disorder."
">Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical  efficacy and safety  outcomes of the treatment with  cryoballoon ( CB )  compared to the  treatment with traditional irrigated radiofrequency ablation ( RF ) for pulmonary vein isolation  ( PVI ) in  patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( pAF ) and refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy ( AAD ) .  Design We conducted a systemic review to find and include more than two  r  and omized controlled trials  (  RCTs  ) with at least 20 patients in each of the  CB  and RF groups .  Thereafter , we performed a meta- analysis to compare the treatment with  CB and RF  in primary outcomes including 1 year free from  AF  ,  complications  and re-ablation procedures . Additionally , we evaluated  procedure  time and  fluoroscopy  duration in both groups . Risk of bias in the individual studies and across studies was assessed using Cochrane methods . Data extraction and synthesis Two review ers extracted study data and assessed risk of bias . Primary outcome data were extracted from the time point 1 year after the procedure . The r and om-effects model was used to calculate the odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval . Data sources Data sources utilized were PubMed and CENTRAL data bases up to 16 June 2016 . Eligibility criteria for selecting studies  Included studies were RCTs in adults with pAF and refractory to AAD  in which   CB therapy   ,  including 1st and  2nd  generation CB  , was compared to the  traditional irrigated RF therapy .  Clinical outcomes assessed in each RCT were 1 year  AF-free survival , complication rates , re-ablations , fluoroscopy time and procedure time .  Results The systematic review identified four r and omized controlled trials that reported on comparative clinical outcomes  involving 1284 patients .  Our meta- analysis demonstrated that CB ablation had a non-significant higher  success rate  than RF therapy ( OR 1.13 ; 95 % CI 0.72–1.77 ) . However , our study showed a relatively higher  rate of complications  in  the CB  group ( OR 1.20 ; 95 % CI 0.58–2.52 ) .  Furthermore , CB  treatment was associated with a non-significant ,  shorter procedure time  and  marginally prolonged fluoroscopy time  in comparison to RF treatment . Conclusion Our systemic review and meta- analysis revealed further evidence that  cryoballoon ablation  is an equally effective alternative procedure to the st and ard radiofrequency treatment with a slightly , non-significant higher  freedom from AF  1 year after the ablation and a shorter  procedure time ."

The risk of developing a complete AV block and the lack of tools to identify patients at high risk of developing the condition argue for the implantation  of a dual-chamber pacemaker  programmed to minimise unnecessary ventricular pacing .

"kAIMS Thromboembolic risk stratification schemes and  clinical  guidelines for  atrial fibrillation ( AF )  regard risk as independent of classification into paroxysmal ( PAF ) and non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( NPAF ) . The aim of the current study was to conduct a systematic review evaluating the impact of AF type on  thromboembolism , bleeding , and mortality .  METHODS AND RESULTS PubMed was search ed through 27 November 2014 for r and omized controlled trials , cohort studies , and case series reporting prospect ively collected clinical outcomes stratified by AF type . The  incidence of thromboembolism , mortality , and bleeding  was extracted . Atrial  fibrillation  clinical outcome data were extracted from  12 studies containing 99 996 patients .  The  unadjusted risk ratio ( RR ) for thromboembolism  in NPAF vs. PAF was 1.355 ( 95 % CI : 1.169 - 1.571 , P < 0.001 ) . In the study subset off oral anticoagulation , unadjusted RR was 1.689 ( 95 % CI : 1.151 - 2.480 , P = 0.007 ) . The  overall multivariable adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) for thromboembolism  was 1.384 ( 95 % CI : 1.191 - 1.608 , P < 0.001 ) . The overall  unadjusted RR for all-cause mortality  was 1.462 ( 95 % CI : 1.255 - 1.703 , P < 0.001 ) .  Multivariable adjusted HR for all-cause mortality  was 1.217 ( 95 % CI : 1.085 - 1.365 , P < 0.001 ) .  Rates of bleeding  were similar , with unadjusted RR 1.00 ( 95 % CI : 0.919 - 1.087 , P = 0.994 ) and adjusted HR 1.025 ( 95 % CI : 0.898 - 1.170 , P = 0.715 ) .  Non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is associated with a highly significant  increase in thromboembolism and death .  These data suggest the need for new therapies to prevent AF progression and further studies to explore the integration of AF type into models of thromboembolic risk."

"eUrinary incontinence ( UI ) , the involuntary loss of urine , affects about 17 % of nonpregnant women ( 1 ) , and its prevalence increases with age , particularly after menopause . Incontinence may have a negative effect on a woman 's physical , psychological , and social well-being and may impose substantial lifestyle restrictions . The most common types of  UI in women  are stress  , urgency  ,  and mixed  incontinence . Stress UI is the involuntary loss of urine with effort or physical exertion or on sneezing or coughing , urgency UI is associated with a sudden compulsion to urinate that is difficult to defer , and mixed UI has features of both types ( 2 ) .  Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions  are available to manage UI . Nonpharmacologic approaches mostly aim to strengthen the pelvic floor or change behaviors that influence bladder function , whereas pharmacologic treatments primarily address bladder and urethral sphincter function . We conducted a broad systematic review of the  clinical effects and harms  of all  nonsurgical treatments  for stress , urgency , and mixed UI  in nonpregnant women .  Although some causes of UI are amenable to surgery , we focused only on nonsurgical interventions . The review ( available at www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov ) was commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) ( 3 ) . This article presents the network meta- analysis ( NMA ) that focuses on  symptomatic cure  and  improvement  outcomes  ;  the technical report presents details of other outcomes , including  adverse events  and  quality of life  ( 3 ) . Methods The Evidence -based Practice Center at Brown University used established systematic review methods , as outlined in the AHRQ Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Review s ( 4 ) . The review is registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42017069903 ) . Detailed descriptions of the review and NMA methods may be found in Supplement 1 and in the full report ( 3 ) . Supplement .  Network Meta- analysis Model and Inconsistency  Analysis Results ( Supplement 1 ) ; Literature Search Strategies ( Supplement 2 ) ; Network Meta- analysis Results ( Supplement 3 ) ; and Evidence Profile for  Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Interventions  for UI ( Supplement 4 ) Data Sources and Search es We up date d a systematic review conducted in 2012 ( 5 ) and included all eligible studies from that earlier work . We search ed MEDLINE , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( Wiley ) , the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s ( Wiley ) , EMBASE ( Elsevier ) , CINAHL ( EBSCO ) , and PsycINFO ( American Psychological Association ) to identify relevant primary research studies published since 2011 . See Supplement 2 for search strategies . For the full report ( 3 ) , final search es were conducted on 4 December 2017 . We also included other eligible studies identified by AHRQ , PCORI , peer review ers , manufacturers , and other stakeholders . On 10 August 2018 , we performed an up date d search for r and  omized controlled  trials ( RCTs ) on MEDLINE , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Web site , and Clinical Trials.gov . After 2 rounds of pilot screening were conducted for training purpose s , a  team  of  6 research ers  independently double-screened all identified citations ( abstract s ) using Abstrackr ( http://abstrackr.cebm.brown.edu ) ; conflicts were resolved by group discussion . The full texts of all potentially relevant studies were rescreened in duplicate . Study Selection We included  studies of adult women with stress , urgency , or mixed UI , excluding those who were pregnant , hospitalized , or institutionalized and those with UI due to urinary tract infection or neurogenic bladder ; however , we allowed up to 10 % of study participants to fall into any of the exclusion categories .  We included comparisons of  pharmacologic , nonpharmacologic ( nonsurgical ) , and placebo ( or sham or no ) treatments  for stress , urgency , or mixed UI . Among eligible interventions , we included those that sometimes require minor surgery ( such as device implantation for sacral neuromodulation ) or might be performed in an office setting ( such as periurethral bulking and bladder onabotulinum  toxin A  [  BTX ]  injection ) . Studies had to report categorical  symptomatic cure (  for example ,  cured vs. not cured ) , improvement , or satisfaction after treatment ; quality -of-life score after treatment ; or adverse events  related to treatment . This article focuses on the clinical  outcomes of cure and improvement .  As commonly understood ,  symptomatic cure  means  resolution of incontinence ;  it does not imply permanent cure  .  We included RCTs with no minimum sample size and nonr and omized comparative studies with at least  50 women  per intervention group . All studies had to have a minimum follow-up of 4 weeks . We included only peer- review ed publications and studies with complete results data in Clinical Trials.gov or available from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . We included translatable studies in any language . Four studies , 2 in Russian and 2 in Persian , could not be translated and were excluded  . The non-English studies included were published in Spanish ( 2 studies ) , French ( 1 study ) , and Chinese ( 1 study ) .  Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Each new study was extracted and assessed for method ological quality by 1 method ologist . The extraction and assessment were review ed and confirmed by at least 1 other experienced method ologist . Disagreements were resolved by discussion among the team members . Studies were extracted into a customized form in the Systematic Review Data Repository ( https://srdr.ahrq.gov/projects/1153 ) . To assess quality , we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs ( 6 ) . For nonr and omized comparative studies , we evaluated  outcome assessor blinding ; attrition bias ; group similarity at baseline ; adherence ;  and whether groups were selected similarly , analyses were adjusted for differences between groups , and interventions were described adequately . We grade d strength of evidence ( SoE ) according to the AHRQ methods guide ( 7 ) . We assessed SoE for each outcome category for our main conclusion statements across all intervention categories . For each SoE assessment , we considered the  number of studies , study design  s  , study limitations  ( that is ,  risk  of  bias  and  overall method ological quality )  ,  directness of the comparisons  (  in the network )  ,  consistency of study results , precision of any estimates of effect  ( imprecise if the 95 % CI extended beyond both 0.80 and 1.25 ) ,  likelihood of reporting bias , other limitations  ,  and overall findings  across studies . On the basis of these assessment s , we assigned an SoE rating of high , moderate , or low or deemed the evidence insufficient to estimate an effect . Data Synthesis and Analysis Categorization of Interventions Where feasible , we used guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Urological Association to categorize interventions ( 8 , 9 ) . First , we classified the 53 specific interventions for which there were any outcomes of interest ( including  adverse events  ) into 16 categories ( Table 1 ) . Then , we divided the categories further on the basis of whether they are recommended primarily for stress or urgency UI .  Behavioral therapy  is recommended for both stress and urgency UI and thus appeared in both categories .  Neuromodulation  is recommended primarily for urgency UI , but several RCTs evaluated it in women with stress UI ; thus , it also was included in both categories . Next , we stratified the interventions according to whether they are recommended as first- , second- , or  third-line therapies (  8 , 9 ) . Table 1 . Categories of Interventions Evaluated by Eligible Studies Network Meta- analysis We conducted frequentist ( maximum-likelihood ) pairwise comparisons and NMAs of  odds ratios (  ORs ) with mixed-effects ( r and om intercepts and fixed intervention slopes ) or full r and om-effects ( r and om intercepts and slopes ) multilevel models within the generalized linear and latent mixed modeling framework . We assessed consistency qualitatively , deeming direct and indirect effects in agreement if they were in the same direction and if the CI of one included the point estimate of the other , and quantitatively , using a node-split approach ( 10 ) . Further details are provided in Supplement 1 . We conducted separate sets of NMAs for each UI outcome ( cure and improvement ) . Originally , we considered performing separate NMA sets for each UI type ( stress , urgency , and mixed ) ; however , many studies did not restrict their eligibility to women with a specific UI type , and very few studies reported specifically on women with mixed UI . Therefore , for each UI outcome , we ran an overall NMA that included all eligible studies regardless of UI type or line of therapy . Then , we summarized comparisons of interventions on the basis of whether they are used ( or recommended ) primarily for urgency or stress UI and whether they are first- and  second-line  therapies or  third-line  therapies ( 8 , 9 ) . We ran separate sets of NMAs for specific interventions and for intervention categories . The analyses are presented in the full report ( 3 ) . We ran separate NMAs of the subsets of studies that included only  women with stress or  urgency UI and compared these results with the overall analyses .

"yBACKGROUND Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is considered to be the main cause of death and one of the most common diseases affecting health care systems worldwide . Many methods have been used to improve  CVD outcomes  , one of which is to involve  clinical pharmacists  in the direct care of  patients with CVD .  OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review assessing the effectiveness of  clinical pharmacist interventions  within a multidisciplinary team in the secondary prevention of CVD , using studies conducted on  patients with heart failure , coronary heart disease , or those with CVD risk factors .  METHODS Extensive search es of  13 data bases  were performed -- with no time limitation -- to identify r  and omized  controlled trials ( RCT ) in English that evaluated  clinical pharmacist intervention  in  patients with CVD or with CVD risk factors .  Two independent review ers evaluated 203 citations that were the result of this search . Studies were included if they reported direct care from a  clinical pharmacist  in CVD or CVD-related therapeutic areas such as disease-led management or in collaboration with other health care workers ; if they were RCTs ; if they were in patients , out patients , or in the community setting ; and if they included the following outcomes :  CVD control or mortality , CVD risk factor control , patient-related outcomes ( knowledge , adherence , or quality of life ) , and cost related to health care systems .  RESULTS A total of  59 studies were identified  : 45 RCT , 6 non- RCT , and 8 economic studies . 68 % of the outcomes reported showed that  clinical  pharmacy services were associated with better improvement in patients ' outcomes compared with the control group .  The involvement of  a pharmacist  demonstrated an ability to improve  CVD outcomes  through providing educational intervention ,  medicine management intervention  , or a combination of both . These interventions result ed in  improved CVD risk factors , improved patient outcomes , and reduced number of drug-related problems  with a direct effect on CVD control . These improvements may lead to an improvement in  patient quality of life , better use of health care re sources  , and a reduced rate of mortality."
"sThis systematic review aim ed to assess the determinants of the   parathyroid hormone ( PTH )  level response  to  vitamin D supplementation .  We search ed Medline , Google Scholar and the reference lists of previous review s. All r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) on  vitamin D supplementation  that involved  apparently healthy human subjects with a report of PTH were selected .  Potential studies were screened independently and in duplicate . Results are summarised as mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals . Quality  assessment , subgroup analysis ,  meta- analysis and meta-regression analysis were carried out .  Thirty-three  vitamin D  supplementation RCT were included  .  Vitamin D supplementation  significantly  raised circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D )  with significant heterogeneity among studies with a  pooled mean difference  ( PMD ) of 15.5 ng/ml ( test for heterogeneity : P<0·001 and I 2=97·3 %  ) . Vitamin D supplementation  significantly  reduced PTH level  with PMD of -8·0 pg/ml , with significant heterogeneity ( ( test for heterogeneity : P<0·001 ) and the I 2 value was 97·3 % ) . In the subgroup analyses , the optimum  treatment effect for PTH  was observed with Ca doses of 600 - 1200 mg/d ( -22·48 pg/ml ) , after the duration of a > 12-month trial ( -18·36 pg/ml ) , with low  baseline  25(OH)D concentration of < 20 ng/ml ( -16·70 pg/ml ) and in those who were overweight and obese ( -18·11 pg/ml ) . Despite the present meta- analysis being hindered by some limitations , it provided some interesting evidence , suggesting that  suppression of PTH level  needs  higher  vitamin D intake ( 75 μg/d ) than the current recommendations and longer duration s ( 12 months ) , which should be taken into account for nutritional recommendations."

"yBACKGROUND  Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA )  is a common and costly surgical procedure . Despite high success rates , many  TKA patients develop  chronic pain   in the months and years following surgery , constituting a public health burden . Pain catastrophizing is a construct that reflects anxious preoccupation with pain , inability to inhibit pain-related fears , amplification of the significance of pain vis-à-vis health implication s , and a sense of helplessness regarding pain . Recent research suggests that it may be an important risk factor for untoward TKA outcomes . To clarify this impact , we systematic ally review ed the literature to date on pain catastrophizing as a prospect i ve predictor of chronic pain following TKA . METHODS We search ed  MEDLINE , EMBASE  ,  and PsycINFO data bases  to identify articles related to   pain catastrophizing   ,  TKA  , risk models , and chronic pain . We review ed titles and abstract s to identify original research articles that met our specified inclusion criteria . Included articles were then rated for method ological quality . including method ological quality . Due to heterogeneity in follow-up , analyses , and outcomes reported across studies , a quantitative meta- analysis could not be performed . RESULTS We identified  six prospect i ve longitudinal studies with small-to-mid-sized  sample s that met the inclusion criteria . Despite considerable variability in reported pain outcomes  , pain catastrophizing  was identified as a significant predictor of  chronic pain  persisting ≥3 months following TKA in five of the studies assessed . Limitations of studies included lack of large-scale data , absence of st and ardized pain measurements , inadequate multivariate adjustment , such as failure to control for analgesic use and other relevant covariates , and failure to report non-significant parameter estimates .  This study provides moderate-level evidence for  pain catastrophizing  as an independent predictor of  chronic  pain post-TKA . Directions for future research include larger , well-controlled studies with st and ard pain outcomes , identification of clinical ly-relevant catastrophizing cut-offs that predict pain outcomes , investigation of other psychosocial risk factors , and assessment of interventions aim ed to reduce  pain catastrophizing  on  chronic pain outcomes  following TKA surgery."
"yGreen  tea or green tea extract ( GT/GTE )  has been demonstrated to reduce  insulin resistance and improve glycemic control .  However , evidence for this health beneficial effect is inconsistent . This systematic review evaluated the effect of  GT/GTE  on insulin resistance and glycemic  control  in  people with pre-diabetes/type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .  Ovid MEDLINE , Embase , AMED , Web of Science , and the Cochrane Library were search ed up to April 2017 for r and omised controlled trials of  participants with pre-diabetes or T2DM  , where the intervention was  GT/GTE .  Meta- analysis was performed to assess  the st and ardised mean difference ( SMD ) in biomarkers of insulin resistance and glycemic control  between  GT/GTE  and  placebo  groups .  Six studies ( n=382 )  were pooled into r and om-effects meta- analysis . Overall , no differences were found between  GT/GTE  and the  placebo  for  glycosylated hemoglobin  ( HbA1c : SMD , -0.32 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -0.86 to 0.23 ) ,  homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance  ( HOMA-IR : SMD , 0.10 ; 95 % CI , -0.17 to 0.38 ) ,  fasting insulin  ( SMD , -0.25 ; 95 % CI , -0.64 to 0.15 ) , and  fasting glucose  ( SMD , -0.10 ; 95 % CI , -0.50 to 0.30 ) . No evidence support the  consumption of GT/GTE  could reduce the  levels of HbA1c , HOMA-IR , fasting insulin , or fasting glucose  in  people with pre-diabetes/T2DM  . However , the studies included were small and of varying quality."
" Overall , five review s scored 6 or above using the  AMSTAR scale  and the inter-rater agreement was good ( 83.6 % ) , whereas seven review s achieved a low risk of bias rating using ROBIS and the inter-rater agreement was fair ( 60.0 % ) . No firm conclusions were drawn for efficacy of either spinal manipulation or homoeopathy for FM . There is limited evidence for topical Capsicum , but further research is required . There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of  acupuncture  for FM , but further high- quality trials are needed to investigate its benefits , harms and mechanisms of action , compared with no or st and ard treatment .

"wA previous review concluded that  postural sway  is increased in  patients with low back pain ( LBP ) .  However , more detailed analysis of the literature shows that postural deficit may be dependent on experimental conditions in which patients with LBP have been assessed . The research question to be answered in this review was : "" Is there any difference in  postural sway  between  subjects with and without LBP  across several sensory  manipulation conditions  ? "" . A literature search in Pubmed , Scopus , Embase and PsychInfo was performed followed by h and search and contact with authors . Studies investigating  postural sway  during  bipedal stance without applying external forces  in  patients with specific and non-specific LBP compared to healthy controls  were included .  Twenty three articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria .  Most studies reported an increased  postural sway  in LBP , or no effect of LBP on  postural sway  . In a minority of studies , a decreased  sway  was found in  LBP patients .  There were no systematic differences between studies finding an effect and those reporting no effect of LBP  .  The proportion of studies finding between-group differences did not increase with increased complexity of  sensory manipulations .  Potential factors that may have caused inconsistencies in the literature are discussed in this systematic review."
"hBACKGROUND Food allergies affect up to 8 % of American children  .  The current recommended treatment for food allergies is strict elimination of the allergens from the diet . Dietary elimination of nutrient-dense foods may result in inadequate nutrient intake and impaired growth  .  The purpose of this review was to critically analyze available research on the effect of an  elimination diet  on  nutrient intake  and  growth  in  children with multiple food allergies .  METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted and a workgroup was established to critically analyze each relevant article . The findings were summarized and a conclusion was generated . RESULTS Six studies were analyzed . One study found that  children with food allergies  are more likely to  be malnourished  than children without food allergies  .  Three studies found that  children  with  multiple food allergies  were  shorter  than children with 1 food allergy . Four studies assessed   nutrient  intake  of  children with multiple food allergies  , but the inclusion and comparison criteria were different in each of the studies and the findings were conflicting . One study found that  children with food allergies who did not receive nutrition counseling  were more likely to have  inadequate intake of calcium and  vitamin D.     Children with multiple food allergies  have a higher risk of  impaired growth  and may have a higher risk of  inadequate nutrient intake  than  children  without food allergies . Until more research is available , we recommend monitoring of nutrition and growth of  children with multiple food allergies  to prevent possible  nutrient  deficiencies and to optimize growth."
"MBackground Previous studies showed that  probiotics  could improve  glycemic control  and attenuate some of the  adverse  effects  of type 2 diabetes .  However , whether the effects are generalizable to  gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM )  remains uncertain . Objective We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the effects of  probiotic supplement  in GDM . Method PubMed , EMBASE , the Cochrane Library , and EBSCO were systematic ally search ed for relevant literature published through January 2019 . R and  omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) assessing the effects of  probiotic supplement  on one or more of the following in GDM were included :  pregnancy  outcome ( the primary outcome ) ,  glycemic control , blood lipid profile , and inflammation and oxidative stress .  Two review ers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in studies . Meta- analysis was conducted by using the fixed effects model unless substantial heterogeneity was found among studies . Results  Eleven r and omized trials involving 719 participants were included for analysis . Eight of the trials were from Iran .   Probiotics  were given alone in eight trials and  synbiotics  in three trials . Though the components of probiotics varied , Lactobacillus was included in all trials and Bifidobacterium in all except one . The duration of intervention ranged from 4 to 8 weeks . Almost all trials ( 10/11 ) had a low risk of bias .  Probiotic supplementation  reduced the risk of  a newborn 's hyperbilirubinemia  by 74 % and improved four  biomarkers for glycemic control ( fasting blood glucose , fasting serum insulin , homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance , and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index )  , two  biomarkers for lipid profile ( triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol )  , and  four biomarkers for inflammation and oxidative stress ( total glutathione , malondialdehyde , nitric oxide , and total antioxidant capacity )  . But significant heterogeneity was observed in the meta-analyses on the four biomarkers related to  glycemic control  and on  triglycerides  , which could not be explained by prespecified subgroup analyses according to the mean age of participants and intervention type ( i.e. ,  probiotics  or  synbiotics )  . The effects on the  risk of preterm delivery , macrosomia and a newborns ' hypoglycemia , gestational age , total cholesterol , and LDL-cholesterol  were not statistically significant . Conclusion  Probiotic supplementation  seemed to be able to reduce the risk of a  newborn 's hyperbilirubinemia  and improve  glycemic control , blood lipid profiles and inflammation and oxidative stress  in  pregnant women with GDM .  However , due to the heterogeneity among existing studies , the surrogate nature of outcomes , and /or the fact that most studies were from Iran , the clinical significance and generalizability of the above findings remain uncertain . Further studies are warranted to address the limitations of existing evidence and better inform the management of GDM."

"tAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) has a significant impact on  children ’s  classroom behaviour , daily functioning and experience of school life . However , the effects of drug treatment for ADHD on learning and academic achievement are not fully understood . This review was undertaken to describe the effects of  methylpheni date , dexamfetamine , mixed amfetamine salts and atomoxetine  on  children ’s on-task   behaviour  and their academic performance , and to perform a meta- analysis to quantify these effects .  Nine electronic  data bases were systematic ally search ed for r and omized controlled trials comparing drug treatment for ADHD against ( i )  no drug treatment  , ( ii )  baseline  ( in crossover trials ) , or (  iii ) placebo ;  reporting outcomes encompassing measures of educational achievement within the classroom environment .  Forty-three studies involving a pooled total of 2,110 participants were identified for inclusion .  Drug treatment benefited children in the  amount of school work that  they  completed  , by up to 15 % , and less consistently improved  children ’s accuracy  in specific  types of academic assignments  ,  such as arithmetic .  Similar improvements were seen in  classroom behaviour  , with up to 14 % more of children  ’s time spent “ on task ” .   Methylpheni date , dexamfetamine  and  mixed amfetamine  formulations all showed  beneficial effects on children ’s on-task behaviour and academic work completion .   Atomoxetine  was examined in two studies , and was found to have  no significant effect  . These review findings suggest that medication for ADHD has the potential to improve  children ’s learning and  academic achievement."
"  Recombinant human growth hormone ( hGH )  doses between 0.3 - 0.375 mg/kg/wk increase  short-term growth  in  girls with Turner Syndrome ( TS )  by approximately 3 cm in the first year of treatment and by approximately 2 cm per year after 2 years of treatment . There is little evidence on the effects of  hGH  on  final height .  Treatment in one trial increased  final height  by approximately 5 cm over an untreated control group . Despite this increase , the fated control group . Despite this increase , the  final height  of treated women was still outside the normal range ( more than two st and ard deviations below the normal population mean ) . Additional trials of the effects of  hGH  carried out with control groups until final height is achieved would allow better informed decisions about whether the benefits of  hGH  treatment outweigh the requirement of treatment over several years at considerable cost."

"dUNLABELLED The aim of this systematic review is to describe participation in  social and physical leisure activities  among  children and adolescents with JIA  , as well as identify potential determinants of leisure participation . METHODS Electronic data bases were systematic ally search ed for articles  published up until June 2013  pertaining to  participation  in   leisure activities  among youth with JIA and other rheumatic diseases .  Studies were included if they measured involvement in either  social or physical leisure activities .  Selection and quality appraisal of articles were completed independently by two authors . RESULTS  Eight hundred and ninety-three articles were found through electronic and reference search  .  One hundred and nine full articles were  review ed to assess for eligibility . Twelve articles met inclusion criteria and findings were review ed . Most focused on describing participation in  physical  rather than  social activities .  Results suggest that  youth with  JIA participated less in both   social and physical leisure activities   as compared to healthy peers , and those with JIA did not meet national recommendations for physical activity . Potential determinants of leisure participation were socio-demographic ( age , sex ) , anthropometric ( height , weight ) and disease-related  ( JIA subtype , disease duration , pain , number of swollen or painful joints , stiffness , fatigue , well-being )  factors .  Characterization of leisure activity remains limited and mostly focused on physical activity in JIA . Assessment of more comprehensive outcome measures is warranted to obtain a better description of leisure in this population . Evidence of the influence of context ual factors as potential determinants of involvement in leisure among  children with pediatric rheumatologic diseases  is needed."

"eBACKGROUND This is the first systematic review and meta- analysis of the large body of data describing the   Swedish adjustable gastric b and ( SAGB )  and Lap-B and ( LB ) .  METHODS A systematic review was performed that included screening of studies  published in any language ( January 1 , 1998 through April 30 , 2006 )  identified through MEDLINE , Current Contents , or the Cochrane Library .  Studies with > or = 10  SAGB  or LB patients reporting > or = 30-day efficacy or safety outcomes  were eligible for review ; the data were extracted from the accepted studies . A weighted means analysis and r and om-effects meta- analysis of efficacy outcomes of interest were conducted . RESULTS  A total of 4592 bariatric surgery studies met the initial criteria .  Of these studies ,  129 ( 28,980 patients ) were  accepted ( 33 SAGB and 104 LB studies ) ; most had a  retrospective single-center design  .  For 4273 patients ( 36 treatment groups ) in 33 SAGB studies and 24,707 patients ( 111 groups ) in 104 LB studies  , the  mean baseline age ( 39.1 - 40.2 yr ) , body mass index ( 43.8 - 45.3 kg/m2 ) , and gender ( women 79.2 - 82.5 % )  were similar . A laparoscopic technique was used in > or = 88 % and a pars flaccida technique in > or = 41 % of both groups .  Early mortality  was equivalent for SAGB/LB ( < or = .1 % ) . The 3-year mean  SAGB  and LB  excess weight loss  ( 56.36 % and 50.20 % , respectively ) and  body mass index reduction  ( -11.99 and -11.81 kg/m2 , respectively ) from baseline were statistically significant ( P < .05 ) , as was the  resolution of diabetes  ( 61.45 % and 60.29 % , respectively ) and  hypertension  ( 62.95 % and 43.58 % , respectively ) . Although scant and inconsistently reported data precluded direct statistical comparisons , the  complication rates  for the 2 devices appeared comparable . In 8 directly comparative studies , meta- analysis found a significantly greater  absolute weight loss  ( P < .05 ) with the SAGB at 2 years ( 48.4 versus 41.9 kg , mean difference -4.84 , 95 % confidence interval -9.47 to -0.22 ) , although no difference was found in the percentage of  excess weight loss  or  change  in  body mass index .   In a systematic review of the published world SAGB and LB data , at 1 , 2 , and 3 years , the  weight loss , resolution of diabetes and hypertension , and complications  appeared comparable."
"dAppendicectomy has been accepted as the gold st and ard for the management of appendicitis over the years , but there has been an increasing evidence and trend toward the conservative approach to the management of  appendicitis .  The aim of this review is to search existing literature and to evaluate and compare the  conservative and operative approaches  to the management of  appendicitis .  An electronic search of published literature was conducted through Pubmed , Google Scholar , Embase , and Medline using a variety of search items to find relevant observational studies , r and omized clinical trials , systematic review s , and meta-analyses . Bibliographies of selected articles were also analyzed for publications of interest relevant to the scope of the topic . The articles that reported primary outcomes after the management of appendicitis ,  complications , economic implication s , and duration of follow-up  were review ed in detail . The major primary outcomes show  a high recurrence rate and failed treatment  associated with the  conservative management  of appendicitis . The other outcomes obtained show that there is an  increased incidence of complications  associated with operative management .  Economic implication s and cost-effectiveness analysis  show that conservative treatment may be preferred . The  length of hospital stay  was significantly higher in conservative approach to management ; however ,  shorter time off activities  was observed . In general , the conservative  management  of appendicitis is still regarded as safe , effective , and efficacious , and further research with well-constructed study design , and larger sample size is required."
" The knowledge in the field of advanced  , metastatic , and castration-resistant PCa  is rapidly changing . These EAU guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice . A full version is available at the EAU office or at www.uroweb.org . PATIENT SUMMARY We present a summary of the 2013 version of the European Association of Urology guidelines on treatment of  advanced , relapsing , and castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) .   Luteinising  hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonists are the st and ard of care in metastatic prostate cancer ( PCa ) . LHRH antagonists decrease  testosterone  without any testosterone surge , and they might be associated with an oncologic benefit compared with LHRH analogues . Complete and rogen blockade has a small  survival  benefit of about 5 % . Intermittent and rogen deprivation results in  noninferior oncologic efficacy  when compared with continuous and  rogen-deprivation therapy  ( ADT ) in well-selected population s. In locally advanced and metastatic PCa , early ADT does not result in a significant  survival advantage  when compared with delayed ADT .  Relapse  after local therapy is defined by  prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) values  > 0.2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy ( RP ) and > 2 ng/ml above the nadir and after radiation therapy . Therapy for PSA  relapse  after RP includes  salvage radiation therapy at PSA levels < 0.5 ng/ml and salvage RP or cryosurgical ablation of the prostate in radiation failures  . Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) are of limited importance if the PSA is < 1.0 ng/ml ; bone scans , and CT can be omitted unless PSA is > 20 ng/ml . Follow-up after ADT should include  analysis of PSA and testosterone levels  , and  screening for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome .  Treatment of  castration-resistant CRPC   includes sipuleucel-T , abiraterone acetate plus prednisone ( AA/P ) , or chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2 ) every 3 wk . Cabazitaxel , AA/P , enzalutamide , and radium-223  are available for second-line treatment of CRPC  following docetaxel . Zoledronic acid and denosumab  can be used in  men with CRPC and osseous metastases  to prevent  skeletal-related complications .  The guidelines reported should be adhered to in daily routine to improve the quality of care in  PCa patients .  As we have shown recently ,  guideline  compliance is only in the area of 30 - 40 %."
"sPrevious studies have reported that  steroids  may reduce the  risk  of   atrial fibrillation ( AF ) recurrence  after catheter ablation  , but data regarding this issue have been controversial . Therefore , we conducted a meta- analysis of r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) and observational studies to ascertain the association of  steroids  and   AF  recurrence   after ablation .  PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane online data bases were search ed from inception to December 2017 . The primary outcome of the meta- analysis was  short-term or long-term AF recurrence  following a single ablation  procedure  with or without the use  of steroids  . Both fixed- and r and om-effects models were used to calculate the overall effect estimates .  Eight studies ( four RCTs and four observational studies ) , with a total 992 patients , were included in the present study  . Our meta- analysis shows that  steroid  use was associated with  reduced AF occurrence  at 3 months ( odd ratio ( OR ) = 0.53 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.31 - 0.90 , P=0.02 ) and 12 - 14 months ( OR = 0.67 , 95 % CI = 0.47 - 0.95 , P=0.02 ) after  radiofrequency  ( RF )  catheter ablation  ( RFCA ) . No clear benefit was observed for  AF recurrence  at 2 - 3 days , 1 or 24 months of follow-up .  Steroid  use was associated with decreased  risk of early AF recurrence  3 and 12 - 14 months after ablation . No clear relationship was observed for 2 - 3 days , 1 and 24 months of follow-up and further data are needed to clarify these results."

Relevant articles were identified by the following criteria :  apparently healthy children and adolescents aged 3–18 years with muscular fitness assessed at baseline ( e.g. , h and grip , st and ing long jump , sit-ups , among others ) , and a follow-up period of ≥ 1 year .  The outcome measures  were anthropometric and adiposity measurements and cardiometabolic , bone and musculoskeletal health parameters  . Two authors independently extracted data . Results  Thirty studies were included in the meta- analysis , yielding a total of 21,686 participants .  The meta- analysis found a significant , moderate-large ( p < 0.05 ) effect size  between muscular fitness at baseline and body mass index  ( r = − 0.14 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) − 0.21 to −  0.07 ) , skinfold thickness  ( r = − 0.32 ; 95 % CI − 0.40 to − 0.23  ) , homeostasis model assessment estimated insulin resistance  ( r = − 0.10 ; 95 % CI − 0.16 to −  0.05 ) , triglycerides  ( r = − 0.22 ; 95 % CI − 0.30 to −  0.13 ) , cardiovascular disease risk  score ( r = − 0.29 ; 95 % CI − 0.39 to − 0.18  ) , and bone mineral density  ( r = 0.166 ; 95 % CI 0.086 to 0.243 ) at follow-up . Conclusion A prospect i ve negative association was observed between muscular fitness in childhood/adolescence  and adiposity and cardiometabolic parameters  in later life , together with a positive  association for bone  health . There is inconclusive evidence for  low  back pain benefits."
"hTo systematic ally review available evidence related to the characteristics of  bone changes   post-stroke  and the relationship between various aspects of muscle function ( e.g. , strength , spasticity ) and bone properties after  stroke  onset . An extensive online data base search was undertaken ( last search in January 2019 ) .  Articles that examined the bone properties in stroke patients were included .  The quality of the studies was evaluated with the  National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Study Quality Assessment Tools .  Publication bias of meta-analyses was assessed using the Egger ’s regression asymmetry test . The selection and evaluation of the articles were conducted by two independent research ers .  Fifty-nine studies were identified .  In subacute and chronic stroke studies , the skeletal sites in the paretic limbs sustained a more pronounced decline in  bone quality  than did their counterparts in the non-paretic limbs . The rate of changes showed a decelerating trend as post-stroke duration increased , but the timing of achieving the steady rate differed across skeletal sites . The  magnitude of bone changes  in the paretic upper limb was more pronounced than the paretic lower limb . There was a strong relationship between  muscle strength/mass and bone density/strength index .  Muscle spasticity seemed to have a negative impact on  bone integrity  in the paretic upper limb , but its influence on  bone properties  in the paretic lower limb was uncertain .  Substantial bone changes  in the paretic limbs occurred particularly in the first few months after stroke onset .  Early intervention , muscle strength training , and long-term management strategies  may be important to enhance bone  health  post-stroke . This review has also revealed the knowledge gaps which should be addressed in future research."
 We identified 14 different multi-item and 13 different single-item  anxiety  measurement instruments that have been used in pediatric cancer or HSCT . Only three multi-item and two single-item instruments were identified as being reliable and valid among pediatric  cancer  or HSCT patients and would therefore be appropriate to measure  anxiety  in this population.
"eBackground Data comparing  duloxetine  with existing antidepressant treatments is limited . A comparison of  duloxetine  with  fluoxetine  has been performed but no comparison with  venlafaxine  , the other antidepressant in the same therapeutic class with a significant market share , has been undertaken . In the absence of relevant data to assess the place that  duloxetine  should occupy in the therapeutic arsenal , indirect comparisons are the most rigorous way to go . We conducted a systematic review of the efficacy of  duloxetine , fluoxetine and venlafaxine versus placebo  in the treatment of  Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD )  , and performed indirect comparisons through meta-regressions . Methods The bibliography of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the CENTRAL , Medline , and Embase data bases were interrogated using advanced search strategies based on a combination of text and index terms . The search focused on  r and omized  placebo-controlled  clinical trials involving adult patients treated for acute phase Major Depressive Disorder .  All outcomes were derived to take account for varying placebo responses throughout studies . Primary outcome was  treatment efficacy as measured by Hedge 's g effect size .  Secondary outcomes were  response and dropout rates as measured by log odds ratios .  Meta-regressions were run to indirectly compare the drugs . Sensitivity analysis , assessing the influence of individual studies over the results , and the influence of patients ' characteristics were run . Results  22 studies involving  fluoxetine  , 9 involving  duloxetine  and 8 involving  venlafaxine  were selected .  Using indirect comparison methodology ,  estimated effect sizes  for efficacy compared with  duloxetine  were 0.11 [ -0.14;0.36 ] for  fluoxetine  and 0.22 [ 0.06;0.38 ] for  venlafaxine .   Response log odds ratios  were -0.21 [ -0.44;0.03 ] , 0.70 [ 0.26;1.14 ] .  Dropout log odds ratios  were -0.02 [ -0.33;0.29 ] , 0.21 [ -0.13;0.55 ] . Sensitivity analyses showed that results were consistent . Conclusion  Fluoxetine  was not statistically different in either  tolerability or efficacy  when compared with  duloxetine . Venlafaxine  was significantly superior to  duloxetine  in all analyses except  dropout rate .  In the absence of relevant data from head-to-head comparison trials , results suggest that  venlafaxine  is superior compared with  duloxetine  and that  duloxetine  does not differentiate from fluoxetine."
" : Of the most commonly used measures , the majority lacked sufficient evidence to warrant their use with older adults . Based on psychometric evidence , three measures  ( Beck Anxiety Inventory , Penn State Worry Question naire , and Geriatric Mental  Status Examination  )  showed psychometric properties sufficient to justify the use of these instruments when assessing anxiety  in older adults  . In addition , two measures developed specifically for older adults  ( Worry Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory )  were also found to be appropriate for use with older adults."
"yOBJECTIVE We conducted a systematic review to investigate the cross-sectional and prospect i ve associations of  accelerometer-measured total sedentary time  and  breaks in sedentary time  with  individual  cardiometabolic biomarkers  in adults ≥18years of age .  METHODS Ovid Medline , Embase , Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were search ed for studies meeting the inclusion criteria . Due to inconsistencies in the measurement and analysis of sedentary time , data was synthesis ed and presented narratively rather than as a meta- analysis . RESULTS  Twenty-nine studies were included in the review ;  twenty-eight reported on  total  sedentary  time  and six on  breaks in sedentary time  . There was consistent evidence from cross-sectional data of an unfavourable association between  total sedentary time and insulin sensitivity .  There was also some evidence that  total sedentary time  was unfavourably associated  with fasting insulin , insulin resistance and triglycerides .  Furthermore , there was some evidence from cross-sectional data of a favourable association  between breaks in sedentary time and triglycerides .   Total  sedentary  time was consistently shown to be associated with  poorer insulin sensitivity  , even after adjusting for time spent in physical activity . This finding supports the proposed association between sedentary time and the development of  Type 2  diabetes and reinforces the need to identify interventions to reduce time spent sedentary."
"aIn 2011 , the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology and Nutrition systematic ally review ed published evidence related to the safety and  health  effects of the administration of  formulae supplemented with pro- and /or prebiotics compared with unsupplemented formulae .  We up date d evidence on the effects of the administration of  prebiotic-supplemented  infant formulae  ( IF ) compared with unsupplemented IF .  Five data bases were search ed up to March 2017 for r and omised controlled trials . In all ,  forty-one publications were identified  , including  twenty-five new publications  . The administration of currently evaluated  prebiotic-supplemented formulae  to  healthy infants  does not raise  safety concerns  with regard to  growth and adverse effects .  Some favourable clinical effects are possible , primarily  stool softening  , which may be beneficial in some infants . Currently , there is no existing robust evidence to recommend the routine use of  prebiotic-supplemented  formulae . The latter conclusion may reflect the small amount of data on specific prebiotics and outcomes , rather than a genuine lack of an effect . The  efficacy and safety  should be considered for each prebiotic(s)-supplemented formula."

The following recommendations are made following the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE )  scoring  system  . 1 :  Incentive spirometry  alone is not recommended for routine use in the preoperative and postoperative setting to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications . 2 : It is recommended that  incentive spirometry  be used with deep breathing techniques , directed coughing , early mobilization , and optimal analgesia to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications . 3 : It is suggested that deep breathing exercises provide the same benefit as  incentive spirometry  in the preoperative and postoperative setting to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications . 4 : Routine use of  incentive spirometry  to prevent  atelectasis  in  patients after upper-abdominal surgery  is not recommended . 5 : Routine use of  incentive spirometry  to prevent  atelectasis  after coronary artery bypass graft surgery is not recommended . 6 : It is suggested that a volume-oriented device be selected as an  incentive spirometry  device."
">Aims To perform an up date d meta- analysis to assess  efficacy , safety and technical performance  of pulmonary vein isolation using  cryoballoon or radiofrequency catheter ablation  in  patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation .  Methods In June 2017 , data bases and websites were systematic ally search ed for systematic review s , r and omized controlled trials and observational studies reporting data on  efficacy  ,  safety  and technical performance outcomes at follow-up at least 12 months . Research ers independently assessed records ’ eligibility , inclusion and method ological quality of included studies . Results  Six r and omized controlled trials and 25 observational studies – 11 853 patients were included . Studies on paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were 29 and included 11 635 patients .  Meta- analysis results showed no difference between cryoballoon and radiofrequency in terms  of recurrent atrial fibrillation  [ risk ratio 1.04 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.98–1.10 ]  or atrial tachyarrhythmias  ( risk ratio 1.04 , 95 % CI 1–1.08 )  and fluoroscopy time  ( mean difference −1.92 min , 95 % CI −4.89 to 1.05 ) .  Cryoballoon ablation  was associated with  fewer reablations  ( risk ratio 0.79 , 95 % CI 0.64–0.98 ) ,  lower incidence of pericardial effusion  ( risk ratio 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.31–0.89 )  and cardiac tamponade  ( risk ratio 0.33 , 95 % CI 0.18–0.62 ) and  shorter total procedural time  ( mean difference −23.48 min , 95 % CI −37.97 ; −9.02 ) but with  higher incidence of phrenic nerve palsy  ( risk ratio 5.43 , 95 % CI 2.67–11.04 ) . Prespecified subgroup analysis confirmed overall results as  for freedom from atrial fibrillation and atrial tachyarrhythmias .  Only two observational studies included patients with persistent atrial fibrillation , thus hindering any conclusion in this population . Conclusion In  patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation   , cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation  produce similar results in terms of  freedom from recurrent atrial fibrillation  or atrial tachyarrhythmias but with a different  safety  profile ,  being  cryoballoon ablation less associated with  cardiac complications  but more likely to  cause phrenic nerve palsy ."
"8Objective  Type 1 diabetes mellitus  rates are rising worldwide . The health benefits of  physical exercise  in this condition are many , but more than 60 % do not participate , mainly from fear of hypoglycemia . This systematic review explores the effects of  physical exercise modes  on  blood glucose levels  in adults for  hypoglycemia prevention  . Research design and methods  Predefined inclusion criteria were r and omized or non-r and omized cross-over trials of healthy non-obese adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus .   Exercise interventions  used st and ardized protocol s of intensity and timing . Outcomes included  hypoglycemia during or after exercise , and acute glycemic control .  Medline , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , Allied and Complementary Medicine Data base , SPORTD iscus , Cochrane CENTRAL ( 1990 to 11 January 2018 ) , and Embase ( 1988 to 9 April 2018 ) were search ed using keywords and Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) terms . Inclusion s , data extraction and quality assessment using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists were done by one research er and checked by a second . Review Manager ( V.5.3 ) was used for meta- analysis where four or more outcomes were reported . Results From  5459 citations ,  we included  15 small cross-over studies  (  3 non-r and omized )  , 13 assessing  aerobic ( intermittent high-intensity exercise ( IHE ) vs continuous , or continuous vs rest )  and 2 assessing  resistance exercise versus rest .  Study quality was good , and all outcome measures were reported . Thirteen gave  hypoglycemia results  , of which five had no episodes . Meta- analysis of  hypoglycemia  during or after  IHE  compared with  continuous exercise  showed no significant differences ( n=5 , OR=0.68 ( 95 % CI 0.16 to 2.86 ) , I2=56 % ) . For  blood glucose  there was little difference between groups at any time point . Conclusion  IHE  may be safer than  continuous exercise  because of lesser decline in blood glucose , but more research needs to demonstrate if this would be reflected in hypoglycemic  episode  rates . Trial registration number CRD42018068358."

"dBACKGROUND Our previous systematic review of  geriatric assessment ( GA )  in  oncology  included a literature search up to November 2010 . However , the quickly evolving field warranted an up date . Aims of this review : ( i ) provide an overview of all  GA  instruments developed and /or in use in the  oncology setting  ; ( ii ) evaluate  effectiveness  of  GA  in predicting/modifying outcomes ( e.g.  treatment decision impact , treatment toxicity , mortality , use of care )  . MATERIAL S AND METHODS Systematic review of literature  published between November 2010 and 10 August 2012 . English , Dutch , French and German- language articles reporting cross-sectional or longitudinal , intervention or observational studies  of  GA  instruments were included . DATA SOURCES MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsycINFO , CINAHL and Cochrane Library . Two research ers independently review ed abstract s , abstract ed data and assessed the quality using st and ardized forms . A meta- analysis method of combining proportions was used for the outcome impact of  GA  on treatment modification with studies included in this up date combined with those included in our previous systematic review on the use of  GA .  RESULTS  Thirty-five manuscripts reporting 34 studies were identified  . Quality of most studies was moderate to good .  Eighteen studies were prospect  i ve ,  11 cross-sectional  and  5  retrospective . Three studies examined  treatment decision-making impact  and found decisions changed for fewer than half of assessed patients ( weighted percent modification is 23.2 % with 95 % confidence interval ( 20.3 % to 26.1 % ) . Seven studies reported conflicting findings regarding  predictive ability  of   GA   for  treatment toxicity/complications .  Eleven studies examined  GA  predictions of  mortality  , and reported that instrumental activities of daily living , poor performance status and more numerous  GA  deficits were associated with  increased mortality risk .  Other outcomes could not be meta-analyzed .  Consistent with our previous review , several domains of  GA  are associated with  adverse outcomes .  However , further research examining effectiveness of  GA  on treatment decisions and oncologic outcomes is needed."

"FThere are conflicting data regarding the effect of  digoxin  use on  mortality  in  patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) or with congestive heart failure ( CHF ) .  The aim of this meta- analysis was to provide detailed analysis of the currently available study reports . We performed a MEDLINE and a  COCHRANE  search ( 1993 - 2014 ) of the English literature dealing with the effects of  digoxin  on  all-cause-mortality   in subjects with AF or CHF .  Only full-sized articles published in peer- review ed journals were considered for this meta- analysis . A total of  19 reports were identified .  Nine reports dealt with  AF patients , seven with patients suffering from CHF , and three with both clinical conditions .  Based on the analysis of adjusted mortality results of all  19 studies comprising 326 426 patients  ,  digoxin  use was associated with an increased  relative risk of all-cause mortality  [ Hazard ratio ( HR ) 1.21 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.07 to 1.38 , P < 0.01 ] . Compared with subjects not receiving  glycosides , digoxin  was associated with a 29 %  increased mortality risk  ( HR 1.29 ; 95 % CI , 1.21 to 1.39 ) in the subgroup of publications comprising 235 047 AF patients . Among  91.379 heart failure patients  ,   digoxin-associated  mortality risk  increased by 14 % ( HR 1.14 , 95 % CI , 1.06 to 1.22 ) . The present systematic review and meta- analysis of all available data sources suggest that  digoxin  use is associated with an  increased mortality risk  , particularly among patients suffering from AF."
"nPatients  with atrial fibrillation ( AF )  are commonly managed with  rhythm control strategy  , but the natural history of this common arrhythmia leads itself to progression from paroxysmal to persistent or permanent AF , and recurrences are evident despite rhythm control treatments using  cardioversion or catheter ablation .  Numerous clinical factors have been associated with outcomes of  rhythm control or arrhythmia progression  in  patients with AF .  The more common factors have been used to formulate risk stratification scores , to help predict the outcomes of  rhythm control  treatments   or  AF progression .  This review article provides an overview on the published clinical risk scores related to outcomes of rhythm  control strategy  or AF progression."

"dINTRODUCTION  Frail older people  are often unable to undertake  high-intensity exercise programmes . Chair-based exercises ( CBEs )  are used as an alternative , for which health benefits are uncertain . OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of  CBE programmes  for  frail older people  through a systematic review of existing literature . METHOD A systematic search was performed for  CBE-controlled  trials in  frail population s aged ≥65 years published between 1990 and February 2011 in electronic data bases .  Quality was assessed using the Jadad method . RESULTS The search identified  164 references : with 42 duplicates removed , 122 review ed , 116 excluded , and 6 analysed .  26 outcome measures were reported measuring 3 domains  : mobility and function , cardiorespiratory fitness , mental health  . All studies were of low method ological quality ( Jadad score ≤2 ; possible range 0 - 5 ) . Two studies showed no benefit , and four reported some evidence of benefit in all three domains  . No harmful effects  were reported  ;  compliance was generally good .  The quality of the evidence base  for CBEs  is low with inconclusive findings to clearly inform practice . A consensus is required on the definition and purpose  of CBEs .  Large well- design ed r and omised controlled trials to test the effectiveness  of CBE  are justified."
"sBackground The  immediate post concussion assessment and cognitive testing ( ImPACT )  is the most widely used concussion assessment tool . Despite its popularity , it is unclear if validation studies for the ImPACT test covered all aspects of validity to support its widespread use in research and clinical practice . Objective The purpose of this report is to review literature surrounding the validity and the utility of the ImPACT test . Data sources and appraisal A systematic review of relevant studies in PubMed , CINAHL , and PsycINFO was carried out . Studies were evaluated using the STROBE ( strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology ) or the STARD ( st and ards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy ) criteria . Results The literature  search yielded 5968 studies . Sixty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria  and were included in the qualitative review . Although the convergent validity of ImPACT was supported , evidence of  discriminant and predictive validity  ,  diagnostic accuracy  and  responsiveness  was inconclusive . The  utility  of  the  ImPACT test   after acute symptom resolution was sparse . The review found many factors influenced the  validity  and utility  of ImPACT scores .  Conclusion Clinicians must consider the benefit of  ImPACT testing  for their patients on a case-by-case scenario and must take the psychometric properties of the test into account when interpreting results."
" The available trial data suggest that advancing enteral feed volumes at daily increments of 30 ml/kg to 35 ml/kg does not increase the  risk of necrotising enterocolitis  in very preterm or VLBW infants . Advancing the volume of enteral feeds at slow rates result ed in several days delay in  regaining birth weight and establishing full enteral feeds .  The applicability of these findings to  extremely preterm , extremely low birth weight , or growth-restricted infants  is limited . Further r and omised controlled trials in these population s may be warranted to resolve this uncertainty."
"sThe aim of this systematic review was to assess the effect of  diet  on changes in parameters describing the body size phenotype of  metabolically healthy obese subjects .  The data bases Medline , Scopus , Web of Knowledge and Embase were search ed for clinical studies carried out  between 1958 and June 2016  that reported the effect of  dietary intervention  on  BMI , blood pressure , concentration of fasting triglyceride ( TG ) , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , fasting glucose level , the homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) and high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein ( hsCRP )  in  metabolically healthy , obese subjects .  Twelve clinical studies met inclusion criteria . The combined  analyzed  population consists of  1827 subjects aged 34.4 to 61.1 with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 .  Time of intervention ranged from eight to 104 weeks . The baseline characteristics related to  lipid profile  were more favorable for metabolically healthy obese than for metabolically unhealthy obese . The meta-analyses revealed a significant associations between  restricted energy diet and BMI  ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : −0.88 , −0.19  ) , blood pressure (  systolic  blood pressure  ( SBP ) : −4.73 mmHg ; 95 % CI : −7.12 , −2.33 ;  and diastolic blood pressure  ( DBP ) : −2.75 mmHg ; 95 % CI : −4.30 , −1.21 ) and TG ( −0.11 mmol/l ; 95 % CI : −0.16 ,  −0.06 ) . Changes in fasting glucose , HOMA-IR and hsCRP  did not show significant changes . Sufficient evidence was not found to support the use of specific diets in  metabolically healthy obese subjects .  This analysis suggests that the effect of caloric restriction exerts its effects through a  reduction in BMI , blood pressure and triglycerides  in metabolically healthy obese ( MHO ) patients."
"yThe objective of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of  individualized patient education interventions  to  st  and  ardized patient education interventions  on the rate of readmission , performance of specific health behaviours , depression , anxiety , and cognition during the  post-hospital discharge recovery period following cardiovascular surgery .  DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES  R and omized controlled trials that included study participants who underwent their first bypass and /or valve replacement surgery ; were eighteen years of age or older ; and were recovering in the community .  REVIEW METHODS For all data analyzed , data was entered based on the principle of intention to treat . To be included in a given comparison , outcome data had to have been available for at least 80 % of those who were r and omized . Assessment of statistical heterogeneity was tested . Generic inverse variance methods based on r and om effects models were used to pool effect estimates across included studies . RESULTS  Seventeen trials involving 2624 study participants where individualized patient education  was the  primary  interventional intent was included in this review .  Four studies that included 930 participants reported  on   hospital  readmissions .  The sources of bias that remain unclear or were judged as containing high risk of bias most frequently across included trials were blinding of outcome assessment , incomplete outcome data , and selective reporting . An effect of the  individualized patient education  in reducing  hospital readmission rates  ( Mean Difference : -1.28 , 95 % CI -1.87 to -0.68 , p<0.00  ) , depression  ( Mean Difference : -23.32 , 95 % CI -23.70 to -22.95 , p<0.00  )  ,  and anxiety  ( Mean Difference : -19.34 , 95 % CI -20.46 to -18.23 , p<0.00 ) was noted . While an increase in the  performance of specific health behaviours  ( Mean Difference : 3.45 , 95 % CI 3.27 - 3.63 , p<0.00  ) and cognition  ( Mean Difference : 11.17 , 95 % CI 10.66 - 11.68 , p<0.00 ) was found . Most effect estimates were prone to statistical heterogeneity among the trials .  The findings from this systematic review suggest favorable effects on  the readmission rates .  However , a major limitation notes in the current body of evidence relates to the small number of or even lacking number of trials for clinical ly important outcomes . As well , the  individualized patient education intervention  is effective in promoting statistically significant changes in quality of life , performance of health behaviours , depression , and anxiety."
"sCONTEXT Despite the recognized distressing symptom of fatigue in  children with cancer  , little information is available to assist in the selection of an instrument to be used to measure fatigue . OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to 1 ) describe the instruments that have been used to measure  cancer-related fatigue in children and adolescents  and 2 ) summarize the psychometric properties of the most commonly used instruments used to measure fatigue in  children and adolescents with cancer .  METHODS  Five major electronic data bases  were systematic ally search ed for studies using a  fatigue measurement scale  in a  population of children or adolescents with cancer .   Fatigue scales  used in those studies were included in the review . RESULTS  From a total of 1753 articles , 25 were included .  We identified two main  fatigue measurement  instruments used in a  pediatric oncology population  :  1  )   the Fatigue Scale-Child/Fatigue Scale-Adolescent and the proxy report versions for parents and staff  and 2  )   the PedsQL ™ Multidimensional Fatigue Scale  .  These two scales show similar attributes with reasonably good internal consistency and responsiveness .  Either the Fatigue Scale  or PedsQL  Multidimensional Fatigue Scale can be incorporated into clinical research . Future research should focus on identifying specific  fatigue measures  more suited to different purpose s such as comparative trials or identification of high-risk groups."
" Evidence of moderate and high quality shows that  SET  provides an important benefit for  treadmill-measured walking distance ( MWD  and PFWD ) compared with  HBET  and  WA  , respectively . Although its clinical relevance has not been definitively demonstrated , this benefit translates to increased  MWD  of 120 and 210 meters after three months in SET groups . These increased walking distances are likely to have a positive impact on the lives of  patients with IC .  Data provide no clear evidence of a difference between HBET and WA . Trials show no clear differences in  quality of life parameters  nor in  self-reported functional impairment  between  SET  and  HBET .  However , evidence is of low and very low quality , respectively . Investigators detected some improvements in  quality of life  favoring SET over WA , but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants . Future studies should focus on disease-specific  quality of life  and other functional outcomes , such as  walking behavior and physical activity  , as well as on long-term follow-up."
 The results do not provide sufficient evidence for or against recommending probiotics for the treatment of BV .

" The ability to draw firm conclusions is limited by the notable heterogeneity and low quality of most of the included studies . With this caveat in mind , the results of the current meta- analysis suggest  that hatha yoga  does not have effects on  acute , chronic and /or treatment-resistant mood and anxiety  disorders compared to treatment  as  usual or active  control groups  .

Methods : R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating the effects of  curcuminoids  on plasma lipids were search ed in PubMed - Medline , Scopus , Web of Science data bases ( from inception to April 3rd , 2017 ) . A r and om-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis . Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method . A weighted r and om-effects meta-regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounders on lipid concentrations . Results : A  meta- analysis of 20 RCTs with 1427 participants  suggested a significant decrease  in plasma concentrations of triglycerides  ( WMD : −21.36 mg/dL , 95 % CI : −32.18 , −10.53 , p < 0.001 ) , and  an elevation in plasma HDL-C levels  ( WMD : 1.42 mg/dL , 95 % CI : 0.03 , 2.81 , p = 0.046 ) ,  while plasma levels of LDL-C  ( WMD : −5.82 mg/dL , 95 % CI : −15.80 , 4.16 , p = 0.253 )  and total cholesterol  ( WMD : −9.57 mg/dL , 95 % CI : −20.89 , 1.75 , p = 0.098 ) were not altered . The  effects  of curcuminoids  on lipids  were not found to be dependent on the duration of supplementation . Conclusion : This meta- analysis has shown  that curcuminoid  therapy  significantly reduces plasma triglycerides and increases HDL-C levels ."
"CPreoperative  physical exercise protocol s  prior to  cancer surgery  increased in popularity over recent years ; however , the beneficial effect of such protocol s is not well established , with conflicting results reported . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to assess the effects of different modalities or combinations of  preoperative exercise interventions and /or prehabilitation multicomponent training  in  patients with non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) after surgery  on the outcomes related to functional capacity , mental wellness and medical care . We search ed in OVID Embase , Pubmed , Cochrane Library , CINAHL , Scopus , and Web of Science . Characteristics of studies and program results and outcome data were extracted . Changes between the intervention and control groups , from baseline to follow-up ( st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) or relative risk ( RR ) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) for each intervention was pooled using weighted r and om-effects models ) .  A total of 676 participants from 10 RCTs were included in the final analysis   ( aerobic training + inspiratory muscle training  , n = 5  ; aerobic training + strength training + inspiratory muscle training , n =  2  ; aerobic training + strength training , n  = 1  ; multicomponent training , n =  1  ; aerobic training alone  , n = 1 ) . The results showed intervention-induced improvement in  walking endurance  ( SMD = 0.27 ; 95 % CI , 0.11 to 0.44 ; I2 = 0.0 % ) ,  peak exercise capacity  ( SMD = 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.35 to 1.21 ; I2 = 76.7 % ) ,  dyspnoea  ( SMD = -0.30 ; 95 % CI , -0.51 to -0.10 ; I2 = 0.0 % ) ,  risk of hospitalization  ( SMD = -0.58 ; 95 % CI , -0.97 to -0.20 ; I2 = 70.7 % ) , and  postoperative pulmonary complications  ( relative risk ( RR ) = 0.50 ; 95 % CI , 0.39 to 0.66 ; I2 = 0.0 % ) . For the functional capacity and medical care parameters ,  preoperative combined aerobic , resistance , and inspiratory muscle training  was shown to be effective if comprising one to four weeks , performing 1 - 3 sessions per week , with moderate intensity ( 50 % for endurance capacity ) . Further studies with larger sample s and higher method ological quality are needed to clarify the potential benefits of  preoperative exercise training  for patients with NSCLC."
"nOBJECTIVE To amass all available evidence regarding the safety of  intravenous ( IV ) iron preparations  to provide a true balance of efficacy and safety . METHODS Systematic review and meta- analysis of all  r and omized clinical  trials comparing  IV iron  to another comparator . All electronic data bases until January 1 , 2014 , were review ed . Primary outcome was  occurrence of severe adverse events ( SAEs ) .  Secondary outcomes included  all-cause mortality and other adverse events ( AEs ) .  Subgroup analysis was performed on the basis of type of  IV iron  , comparator , treated condition , and system involved . RESULTS  A total of 103 trials published between 1965 through 2013 were included . A total of 10,390 patients were treated with  IV iron  compared with 4044 patients treated with  oral iron  , 1329 with  no iron  , 3335 with  placebo  , and 155 with  intramuscular iron .   There was no increased  risk of SAEs  with  IV iron  ( relative risk [ RR ] , 1.04 ; 95 % CI , 0.93 - 1.17 ; I(2)=9 % ) . Subgroup analysis revealed a decreased  rate of SAEs  when  IV iron  was used to treat heart failure ( RR , 0.45 ; 95 % CI , 0.29 - 0.70 ; I(2)=0 % ) .  Severe infusion reactions  were more common with  IV iron  ( RR , 2.47 ; 95 % CI , 1.43 - 4.28 ; I(2)=0 % ) . There was no  increased risk of infections  with  IV  iron  .   Gastrointestinal AEs  were reduced with  IV iron .    Intravenous iron  therapy is not associated with an increased  risk  of SAEs or infections . Infusion reactions are more pronounced with IV iron."

" Oral  TRT  produces  significant CV risk .  While no significant effects on  CV risk  were observed with either injected or  transdermal TRT  , the point estimates suggest that further research is needed to establish whether administration by these routes is protective or detrimental , respectively . Differences in the degree to which  serum DHT  is elevated may underlie the varying CV risk by  TRT  administration route , as elevated serum dihydrotestosterone has been shown to be associated with  CV  risk in observational studies."
"sThis systematic review aim ed to evaluate the  efficacy  of  neurofeedback ( NF )  compared to  stimulant medication  in treating  children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .  Included in this review are eight r and omized controlled trials that compared an  NF condition , either alone or combined with medication  , to a medication condition , which was mainly methylpheni date . Outcome measures included  behavioral assessment s by parents and teachers , self-reports , neurocognitive measures , electroencephalogram power spectra and event-related potentials .  When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support  theta/beta NF  as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD . Nevertheless , an additive treatment effect of  NF  was observed on top of stimulants and theta/beta NF was able to decrease  medication  dosages , and both results were maintained at 6-month follow-up . This review concludes that the present role of  NF  in treating  children diagnosed with ADHD  should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients . Particularly  patients with  the following  characteristics  may benefit from   NF   treatment : low  responders to medication  ,  intolerable side effects due to medication  , higher  baseline  theta power  spectra  and possibly having no comorbid psychiatric  disorders  . Future research should prioritize the identification of markers that differentiate responders from nonresponders to  NF  treatment , the potential of  NF  to decrease stimulant dosage , the st and ardization of  NF  treatment protocol s and the identification of the most favorable neurophysiological treatment targets."

"yObjective The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review on the effectiveness of  dance-based programs  in  patients with fibromyalgia  , as well as calculate the overall effect size of the improvements , through a meta- analysis . Methods The Cochrane Library , Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) , PubMed , TRIP , and Web of Science ( WOS ) were selected to identify the articles included in this systematic review and meta- analysis .  A total of seven articles  fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria . PRISMA guidelines were followed in the data extraction process . The level of evidence was established following guidelines from the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement ( CBO ) . Results The studies were all r  and omized  controlled trials , but not double-blind . Duration  of dance programs  ranged from 12 to 24 weeks . Sessions lasted between 60 and 120 minutes and were performed 1 - 2 times per week . The  overall effect size for pain  was -1.64 with a 95 % CI from -2.69 to -0.59 which can be interpreted as large . In addition , significant improvements were observed in  quality of life , depression , impact of the disease , anxiety , and physical function .  Conclusion  Dance-based intervention programs  can be an  effective  intervention for  people suffering  from  fibromyalgia  , leading to a significant reduction of the  level of pain  with an effect size that can be considered as large . However , findings and conclusions from this meta- analysis must be taken with caution due to the small number of articles and the large heterogeneity."
"dINTRODUCTION  Idiopathic mastalgia ( benign breast pain of unknown origin )  is often poorly managed because of its subjective nature and unclear aetiology . Mastalgia is a reason for up to 50 % of breast  outpatient referrals .  Existing systematic review s discuss date d treatment options that provide limited  symptomatic relief .  METHODS A systematic review was conducted for aetiology and treatment of  idiopathic mastalgia  in accordance with PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ) guidance . Data bases such as PubMed , MEDLINE , Cochrane Data base and the Clinical Trial Registry were search ed ( February 2016 ) . RESULTS Reassurance plus bra-fitting advice provides  relief  for most women . If symptoms persist , addition of  topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs )  provides  relief  in 70 - 92 % of women . There is some benefit in reducing dietary coffee and fat intake . Medical treatments have serious side-effects ( often and rogenic or menopausal ) and should be considered only in cases resistant to simpler measures .  Dopamine agonists  are useful , but less effective than  endocrine treatments  such as  Danazol  or  Tamoxifen .  Of the Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulator drugs ,  Ormeloxifene  appears most effective , but is not licenced in the United Kingdom .  Relaxation therapy , acupuncture  and  kinesiology  may be useful but currently lack good evidence of effectiveness . DISCUSSION First-line management of  breast  pain should be explanation , reassurance and a bra-fitting advice . Subsequent drug therapy should be balanced against its side-effects ; topical NSAIDs and  Ormeloxifene  show greatest benefit with least  side-effects .  Newer  agents ( Ormeloxifene )  currently being used for  mastalgia  in India could be considered in the developed world."

"yOVER the past decade , the percentage of surgical procedures being performed in  outpatient centers  has increased . In response , outpatient anesthetic practice and research have focused on providing  anesthetics  that minimize symptoms ( e.g. , nausea and vomiting ) in the postanesthesia care unit and hasten time to discharge . Much effort has been placed on development of newer agents with a more favorable recovery profile . Similarly , examination of the  economic parameters  ( e.g. ,  length of recovery room stay , cost-effectiveness of drugs )  after ambulatory  surgery  has focused on the immediate predischarge , postoperative period . A significant portion of research in this area has concentrated on minimizing immediate postoperative symptoms to facilitate patient discharge from the hospital . On the other h and , relatively few studies have evaluated the impact of patient-reported symptoms after discharge from the postanesthesia care unit . Postdischarge symptoms ( those occurring after discharge from the ambulatory surgical unit ) may have an important impact on patient recovery after ambulatory surgery and the economic burden on patients and their caregivers ; however , there has not been a systematic examination of postdischarge symptoms . It is important to know the frequency with which  patients  experience postdischarge symptoms so that providers can better inform patients and research ers can better estimate the burden of these symptoms and potential for the incidence of postdischarge symptoms to serve as a measure of quality of care . Quantification of the incidence of postdischarge symptoms would be the first step in the process in determining the extent of the problem and if perioperative interventions ( e.g. ,  intraoperative anesthetic technique , multimodal analgesia , or pharmacologic agents )  would be effective in diminishing the impact of these patient-related symptoms on  functional recovery and health-related quality of life .  Therefore , we conducted a systematic review and analysis to evaluate the incidence of patient-reported symptoms after outpatient surgery."

"nBackground Health technology assessment s ( HTAs ) by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) enjoy high levels of international attention . The present analysis addresses NICE 's appraisal of  methylpheni date , atomoxetine and dexamphetamine  for  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) in children and adolescents  , published in March 2006 . Methods A qualitative study of NICE Technology Appraisal No. 98 was done focusing on the > 600-page technology assessment report , which aim ed at evaluating ADHD treatment strategies by a clinical effectiveness review and an economic analysis using meta-analytical techniques and a cost-effectiveness model . Results The technology assessment was unable to differentiate between the various drugs in terms of efficacy , and its economic model was ultimately driven by cost differences . While the assessment concluded that the economic model "" clearly identified an optimal treatment strategy "" with first-line  dexamphetamine  , the NICE appraisal committee subsequently found it impossible to distinguish between the different strategies on grounds of cost-effectiveness . Analyzing the assessment reveals gaps and inconsistencies concerning data selection ( ultimately relying on a small number of short-term studies only ) , data synthesis ( pooling of heterogeneous study design s and clinical endpoints ) , and economic model structure ( identifying double-counting of nonresponders as a likely source of bias , alongside further method ological anomalies ) . Conclusion Many conclusions of the NICE technology assessment rest on shaky grounds . There remains a need for a new , state-of-the-art systematic review of ADHD treatment strategies including economic evaluation , which ideally should address outcomes beyond  children 's health-related quality of life  , such as long-term sequelae of the disorder and caregiver burden."

"dBackground : Currently , there is a widespread reliance on  self‐reported question  naires to assess  low back pain patients .  However , it has been suggested that objective measures of low back pain patients ' functional status should be used to aid clinical assessment . The aim of this study is to systematic ally review which kinematic /kinetic parameters have been used to assess  low back pain patients against healthy controls  and to propose clinical kinematic/kinetic measures . Methods : PubMed , Embase and Scopus data bases were search ed for relevant studies . Reference lists of selected studies and h and search es were performed . Studies had to compare  people with and without non‐specific low back pain  while performing functional tasks and report body segment/joint kinematic and /or kinetic data . Two review ers independently identified relevant papers . Findings :  Sixty‐two studies were included .  Common biases identified were lack of assessor blinding and sample size calculation , use of sample s of convenience , and poor experimental protocol st and ardization . Studies had small sample sizes . Range of motion maneuvers were the main task performed ( 33/62 ) .  Kinematic/kinetic data of different individual  or  combination  of body segments/joints were reported among the studies , commonest was to assess the hip joint and lumbar segment motion ( 13/62 ) . Only one study described full body movement . The most commonly reported outcome  was range of motion .  Statistically significant differences between controls and low back pain groups were reported for different outcomes among the studies . Moreover , when the same outcome was reported disagreements were noted . Interpretation : The literature to date offers limited and inconsistent evidence  of kinematic/kinetic measures  in low back pain patients that could be used clinical ly . HighlightsCurrent low back pain assessment relies on subjective measures .Use of objective measures ( kinematics/kinetics ) is encouraged in low back pain assessment .This review highlights the heterogeneity of studies with  low back pain and healthy subjects .  There is poor evidence for  kinematic/kinetic parameters  as low back pain objective measures .Functional tasks , whole body and not only range of motion should be considered."

"nNew technologies are changing the therapeutical options to do  indirect restorations  and new  adhesive systems  are continuously introduced to be used by clinicians . Different interactions between restorations , adhesive systems components , enamel and dentin require having criteria based on the selection of the adhesive system , ensuring the longevity of the restorations and the preservation of the biological remnant . The  adhesion force to the dental tissue  is one of the indicatives of the behavior of the adhesive systems and influences the behavior of the treatments with direct and indirect restorations . The objective of this search was to find the adhesive systems with the best results in terms of the  adhesion strength of  indirect restorations   on the  dental tissues  . The search was conducted in two MEDLINE digital data bases ( PubMed ) , and the Cochrane Library with a search strategy based on the combination of MeSH ( Medical Subject Headings ) keywords . This systematic review used the PRISMA guide ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta- Analysis ) . According to this review , the  3-step adhesive systems  were the best performing and still are the gold st and ard for the cementing of indirect restorations . In addition , it can be concluded that  self-etched adhesive systems  reduce the  time spent in clinical practice  , however at the interface level they behave as permeable membranes more susceptible to degradation."
"eBalance is considered a risk factor for several injuries and consequently a focus of many strengthening , injury prevention , and rehabilitation programs . There are several studies that have evaluated the ability of  balance training  to improve  balance ability  in a  healthy population  with no general consensus . We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the body of evidence regarding the effectiveness of  balance training  on improving various  forms of balance ability  in a  healthy population .  Three electronic data bases and the reference lists of selected articles were search ed . Studies were included that evaluated  balance ability   before and after healthy subjects performed a  multisession balance training program .   Two individuals review ed all articles and agreed upon the selection criteria .  Sixteen articles were selected  , abstract ed , and review ed .  Means and measures of variability  were recorded to calculate effect sizes , and study quality was assessed using the PEDro instrument . There is strong evidence to suggest that balance training can improve  static balance ability  on stable and unstable surfaces , as well as dynamic balance ability .  Elite athletes  have the potential to improve  static balance  on an unstable surface and  dynamic  balance ability , but a ceiling effect appears to occur with stable balance ability on a stable surface . Balance training programs performed at least 10 minutes per day , 3 days per week , for 4 weeks that incorporate various methods of balance training appear to improve  balance ability .  Types of balance training included the use of tilt boards , unstable surfaces , and dynamic body movements while maintaining a static stance."
"sPurpose   High fasting blood  glucose ( FBG )  can lead to chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular and kidney diseases . Consuming  probiotics or synbiotics  may improve  FBG .  A systematic review and meta- analysis of controlled trials was conducted to clarify the effect of  probiotic and synbiotic  consumption on  FBG  levels . Methods PubMed , Scopus , Cochrane Library , and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature data bases were search ed for relevant studies based on eligibility criteria . R and omized or non-r and omized controlled trials which investigated the efficacy of  probiotics or synbiotics  on the  FBG   of adults  were included . Studies were excluded if they were review articles and study protocol s , or if the supplement dosage was not clearly mentioned . Results A  total of fourteen studies ( eighteen trials )  were included in the analysis . R and om-effects meta-analyses were conducted for the mean difference in  FBG  . Overall  reduction in FBG  observed from consumption  of probiotics and synbiotics  was borderline statistically significant ( −0.18 mmol/L 95 % CI −0.37 , 0.00 ; p = 0.05 ) . Neither probiotic nor  synbiotic  subgroup analysis revealed a significant  reduction in FBG  . The result of subgroup analysis  for baseline FBG level  ≥7 mmol/L showed a  reduction in FBG  of 0.68 mmol/L ( −1.07 , −0.29 ; ρ < 0.01 ) , while trials with multiple species of probiotics showed a more pronounced reduction of 0.31 mmol/L ( −0.58 , −0.03 ; ρ = 0.03 ) compared to single species trials . Conclusion This meta- analysis suggests  that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation  may be  beneficial  in   lowering FBG  in adults with high baseline FBG ( ≥7 mmol/L )  and that  multispecies  probiotics may have more impact  on FBG  than single species."
" We tentatively conclude that  CAHTS  can provide individually-tailored information about CVD prevention . However , further primary studies are needed to confirm these findings .

In the absence of evidence on effectiveness , the implementation of  computer-assisted history taking  may only rely on the clinicians ' tacit knowledge , published monographs and viewpoint articles."
">Results of previous clinical trials evaluating the effect of  pycnogenol supplementation  on   blood pressure ( BP )   are controversial . Therefore , we aim ed to assess the impact of  pycnogenol  on  BP  through a systematic review of literature and meta- analysis of available r and omized , double-blind ,  placebo-controlled  clinical studies ( r and omized clinical trials [ RCTs ] ) . Literature search included SCOPUS , PubMed - Medline , ISI Web of Science , and Google Scholar data bases up to January 10 , 2019 to identify RCTs investigating the impact of  pycnogenol  on BP .

"sAsthma is a major public health issue . The co-occurrence of the high prevalence of asthma and vitamin D deficiency documented globally in recent decades has prompted several investigations into a possible association between the two conditions . The objective of this paper was to synthesize the evidence from studies that have measured the association between  serum vitamin  D   and  asthma incidence , prevalence , severity and exacerbations .  A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed , and the available evidence was summarized both qualitatively and by meta- analysis .  Only English language , observational studies  measuring  serum levels of 25(OH)D  as the exposure were  included  , as this is the most robust measure of vitamin D levels . The search identified  23 manuscripts : two case-control , 12 cohort and nine cross-sectional studies .  Collectively , the evidence suggests that higher serum levels of 25(OH)D are associated with a  reduced risk of asthma exacerbations  , but there was little evidence to suggest an association with  asthma incidence , prevalence or severity .  A significant amount of heterogeneity between study methodology and results restricted the scope for meta- analysis . These results suggest that  vitamin D supplementation  may be  effective  for the  prevention of asthma exacerbations  , but the findings need to be confirmed by clinical trials."
"nA systematic review was conducted to summarize the evidence currently available from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) concerning the effect of  iron intake  of  infants , children and adolescents  on measures of  cognitive development  and  function .  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE and Embase were search ed up to and including February 2010 . Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of the articles retrieved . All RCTs with an adequate control group in which  iron  supply was provided by natural food sources , fortified foods , formula or supplements  to infants , children or adolescents until the age of 18 years  were considered for inclusion . No language restrictions were applied .  Fourteen studies met the selection criteria .  Twelve out of these 14 studies had a high or moderate risk of bias . A large degree of heterogeneity of study population s , iron dosages and outcome measures precluded performing a quantitative meta- analysis . Overall , the studies suggest a modest positive effect of iron supplementation on  cognition and psychomotor outcomes  in anemic infants and children after supplementation periods of at least 2 months of duration."
" Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for  patients with a history of SAD  is limited . Method ological limitations and the small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of  light therapy  for SAD . Given that comparative evidence for  light therapy  versus other preventive options is limited , the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences."

"sPURPOSE OF REVIEW  Patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure  experience an increased  morbidity and mortality  from the hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and an increased stroke risk . Consequently , there has been increased attention to procedural alternatives to pharmacologic rhythm control and anticoagulation for stroke prevention . This review aims to evaluate the evidence for  atrial fibrillation ablation  and left atrial appendage closure in  heart failure patients .  RECENT FINDINGS Several r and omized control trials and systematic review s demonstrate the  safety and efficacy  of  atrial fibrillation ablation  in  patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction .  In multiple trials , these patients have shown clinical benefit from  atrial fibrillation ablation  including improved  left ventricular systolic function , quality of life , and clinical heart failure symptoms .  The evidence of clinical benefit of  atrial fibrillation ablation  in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction remains limited . Only a h and ful of r and omized controlled trials have been performed evaluating left atrial appendage closure , and there is insufficient data regarding the  safety and efficacy  of these procedures in  heart failure patients .  SUMMARY  Atrial fibrillation ablation  in heart failure  patients  remains  well tolerated  with an  overall efficacy  comparable to  atrial fibrillation ablation  in patients without heart failure . There is consistent evidence for the clinical benefit of  atrial fibrillation ablation  in heart failure  patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction  and limited evidence for  atrial fibrillation ablation  in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction . Currently , there is insufficient data regarding the  safety and efficacy  of left atrial appendage closure devices in heart failure patients."
"DPrevious systematic review s have demonstrated better results with  enamel matrix derivative proteins ( EMDP )  as compared with  open flap debridement ( OFD )  for the management of  infrabony periodontal defects ( IPD ) .  The aim of this study was to determine whether these differences vary according to the follow-up and quality of the studies . Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Medline / PubMed , Lilacs , Embase and Web of Science electronic data bases were search ed up to August 2013 for r and omized clinical trials . Eligible outcomes were  changes in probing depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level (CAL),gingival recession ( GR ) and bone changes ( BC )  . Studies with follow-up of 12 months showed differences of 0.97 mm ( CI95 % 0.52 - 1.43 ) and 1.19 mm ( CI95 % 0.77 - 1.60 )  for PD and CAL  , respectively , favorable  for EMDP .  Studies with follow-up ≥ 24 months presented advantages of 1.11 mm ( CI95 % 0.74 -1.48 ) for CAL and 0.83 mm ( CI95 % 0.19 -1.48 ) for PD , with  use of EMDP .  Considering the quality of studies , those with low risk of bias showed lower difference between groups , presenting 0.8 mm ( CI95 % 0.24 - 1.36 ) for CAL , favorable  for EMDP  and without differences for PS ( 0.51 mm , CI95 % -0.21 - 1.23 ) . In conclusion , follow-up time ( < or > 2 years ) and the risk of bias influence the results of treatment  with EMDP  in IPD."
"yPurpose  Men who are survivors of prostate cancer  report a variety of psychological and physical factors contributing to a lower  quality of life  , and  physical activity  can assist to mitigate these issues . This review aims to provide a summary of  physical activity behaviour change  trials targeting  prostate cancer survivors  , assess the feasibility of these interventions and , if possible , identify intervention and study characteristics associated with significant intervention effects . Method  Four data bases (  PubMed  ,  CINAHL  ,  PsycINFO  and EMBASE  ) were systematic ally search ed for r and  omised  controlled trials containing at least one behavioural outcome relating to  physical activity  published  up  until  July 2016 .  Forward and backwards , h and , key author citation search ing and known research were also considered . Results  From a total of 13 , 828 titles  , the search result ed in 12 studies ( 6 prostate cancer only and 6 mixed cancer interventions ) , eight of which found positive results most often related immediately to post-intervention  aerobic activity .  Factors relating to efficacy were not conclusive due to the heterogeneity of studies and lack of cancer-specific data in mixed cancer trials . Future research focusing on intervention reach , maintenance of intervention effects and resistance training outcomes is needed . Conclusion There is preliminary evidence to suggest that a variety of  physical activity behaviour change interventions  targeting  men with a history of prostate cancer  can be efficacious , at least in the short term . Experimental studies are required to identify key intervention features . Implication s for Cancer SurvivorsPhysical  activity interventions  can assist prostate cancer survivors in relation to short-term lifestyle change , though more evidence is required to improve the clarity of factors related to efficacy."
"nPurpose The objective of this systematic review was to assess the  three-dimensional changes in bone tissue  after immediate installation of a  single implant  in a  fresh extraction socket in the anterior maxilla .  Methods After defining a strategy , an electronic search was carried out using the data bases PubMed , Embase , LILACS , Web of Science , Cochrane , and Scopus . In addition , the gray literature was also research ed using Google Scholar and ProQuest . Two review ers independently screened for eligible studies , assessed the method ological quality , and extracted the data . The inclusion criteria were observational studies and experimental studies that assessed bone response after the immediate installation of a  single implant  in a fresh  extraction socket  , immediately loaded or not , in the region  between  the  maxillary canines .  Studies were included in any language , with no publication date restrictions and with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up after the surgical procedure . Results From  a total of 3272 articles , only 12 studies met  the inclusion criteria and were selected for the review .  Bone remodeling  after immediate installation of a dental implant was assessed using st and ardized periapical radiographs and cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Conclusion It can be concluded that  bone remodeling  occurs after tooth extraction and immediate implant installation."
"3OBJECTIVE To define the optimal treatment for  women with stage III or locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) .  EVIDENCE Systematic review of English- language literature retrieved from MEDLINE ( 1984 to June 2002 ) and CANCERLIT ( 1983 to June 2002 ) . A non systematic review of the literature was continued through December 2003 . RECOMMENDATIONS The management of LABC requires a combined modality treatment approach involving  surgery , radiotherapy  and  systemic therapy  . Systemic therapy :  chemotherapy .   Operable tumours . Patients with operable stage IIIA disease  should be offered  chemotherapy .  They should receive  adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery , or primary chemotherapy followed by locoregional management . Chemotherapy  should contain an  anthracycline .  Acceptable regimens are 6 cycles of  FAC , CAF , CEF  or  FEC .  Taxanes are under intense investigation . Inoperable tumours  . Patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease  ,  including those with inflammatory breast cancer and those with isolated ipsilateral internal mammary or supraclavicular lymph-node involvement  , should be treated with  primary anthracycline-based chemotherapy .  Acceptable  chemotherapy  regimens are  FAC , CAF , CEF or FEC . Taxanes  are under intense investigation .  Patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease  who respond to primary chemotherapy should be treated until the response plateaus or to a maximum of 6 cycles ( minimum 4 cycles ) . Patients with stage IIIB disease should then undergo definitive  surgery  and  irradiation .  The locoregional management of patients with stage IIIC disease who respond to chemotherapy should be individualized . In patients with stage IIIB or IIIC disease who achieve maximum response with fewer than 6 cycles , further  adjuvant chemotherapy  can be given following surgery and irradiation . Patients whose tumours do not respond to primary chemotherapy can be treated with  taxane chemotherapy  or can proceed directly to irradiation followed by modified radical mastectomy , if feasible . Systemic therapy :  hormonal therapy  . Operable and inoperable tumours . Tamoxifen for 5 years should be recommended to  pre- and postmenopausal women  whose tumours are hormone responsive . Locoregional management . Operable tumours .  Patients with stage IIIA disease  should receive both modified radical mastectomy ( MRM ) and locoregional radiotherapy if feasible . They may be managed with MRM followed by chemotherapy and locoregional radiotherapy , or chemotherapy first followed by MRM and locoregional radiotherapy . Breast-conserving surgery is currently not a st and ard approach . Locoregional radiotherapy should be delivered to the chest wall and to the supraclavicular and axillary nodes . The role of internal mammary irradiation is unclear . Inoperable tumours .  Patients with stage IIIB disease  who respond to chemotherapy should receive surgery plus locoregional  radiotherapy  . The locoregional management of  patients with stage IIIC disease who respond to  chemotherapy   is unclear and should be individualized .  Patients whose disease remains inoperable following  chemotherapy   should receive  locoregional radiotherapy  with  subsequent surgery  , if feasible . VALIDATION The authors ' original text was revised by members of the Steering Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Care and Treatment of Breast Cancer . Subsequently , feedback was provided by 9 oncologists from across Canada . The final document was approved by the steering committee . SPONSOR The Steering Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Care and Treatment of Breast Cancer was convened by Health Canada . Completion date : December 2003."
"MThis systematic review was aim ed at assessing the metabolic  effects  of  testosterone replacement therapy ( TRT )  on  hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .  A literature search was performed using the Cochrane Library , EMBASE and PubMed . Only r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) were included in the meta- analysis . Two review ers retrieved articles and evaluated the study quality using an appropriate scoring method . Outcomes including  glucose metabolism , lipid parameters , body fat and blood pressure  were pooled using a r and om effects model and tested for heterogeneity . We used the Cochrane Collaboration 's Review Manager 5.2 software for statistical analysis .  Five RCTs including 351 participants with a mean follow-up time of 6.5-months were identified  that strictly met our eligibility criteria . A meta- analysis of the extractable data showed that testosterone reduced  fasting plasma glucose levels  ( mean difference ( MD ) : -1.10 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( -1.88 , -0.31 ) ) ,  fasting serum insulin levels  ( MD : -2.73 ; 95 % CI ( -3.62 , -1.84 ) ) ,  HbA1c %  ( MD : -0.87 ; 95 % CI ( -1.32 , -0.42 ) ) and  triglyceride levels  ( MD : -0.35 ; 95 % CI ( -0.62 , -0.07 ) ) . The testosterone and control groups demonstrated no  significant  difference for other outcomes . In conclusion , we found that  TRT  can improve  glycemic control  and decrease  triglyceride levels  of  hypogonadal men with T2DM .  Considering the limited number of participants and the confounding factors in our systematic review ; additional large , well- design ed RCTs are needed to address the metabolic effects of  TRT  and its long-term influence on hypogonadal men with T2DM."

"lWe aim ed to conduct a systematic review of the evidence for  structured , home-based exercise programmes ( HEPs )  in  patients with intermittent claudication .  The Medline , PsycINFO , EMBASE , and Cochrane data bases were search ed up to April 2013 for terms related to walking , self-management , and intermittent claudication . Descriptive , method ological and outcome data were extracted from eligible articles . Trial quality was assessed using the  GRADE system  .  Seventeen studies were included with 1,457 participants .  Six studies compared  HEPs with supervised exercise training  , five compared  HEPs with usual care/observation control  , and seven evaluated  HEPs  in a single-group design . Trial heterogeneity prevented meta- analysis . Nevertheless , there was "" low-level "" evidence that  HEPs  can  improve walking capacity and quality of life  in  patients with intermittent claudication  when compared with baseline or in comparison to  usual care/observation  control . In addition , improvements with   HEPs   may be inferior to those evoked by  supervised exercise training .  Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the  long-term clinical and cost effectiveness of  HEPs   in  patients with intermittent claudication .  Thus , more robust trials are needed to build evidence about these interventions . Nevertheless , clinicians should consider using  structured  interventions to promote  self-managed walking  in  patients with intermittent claudication  , as opposed to simple "" go home and walk "" advice , when  supervised exercise  training is unavailable or impractical."
"nINTRODUCTION  Vortioxetine  is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved for treatment of  major depressive  disorder  ( MDD ) .  This medication is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that also has a number of other potentially relevant effects on serotoninergic receptors , which may differentiate the drug 's effects from those of current first-line antidepressants , such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) . AREAS COVERED This article will review the basic clinical pharmacology of  vortioxetine  , summarize the major clinical trials that were performed prior to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , discuss relevant post-marketing studies of this drug , and offer expert commentary on the significance of this new agent in clinical practice . Pre-approval studies were identified as all r and omized ,  placebo-controlled  studies of  vortioxetine  listed on clinical trials.gov . Other referenced studies were identified via a MEDLINE data base literature search in August 2015 using the key search terms ,  vortioxetine  and Lu AA21004 , combined with additional terms that included  pharmacological profile  , pharmacokinetics  , drug  interactions , adverse effects , side effects , safety , major depression , and major depressive disorder . We identified relevant systematic review s , meta-analyses , r and omized trials and pre clinical studies of importance . EXPERT OPINION Results of placebo-controlled trials suggest  efficacy and an overall safety profile  comparable to existing first-line antidepressants . The most common side effects are  nausea , vomiting and constipation .  Results of several studies indicate that  vortioxetine  may have  therapeutic effects on cognition ( e.g. , memory and executive functioning )  that exceed that of st and ard antidepressants . Disadvantages include cost and the current paucity of long-term efficacy data from large clinical trials . The authors suggest that  vortioxetine  is currently a good second-line antidepressant option and shows promise , pending additional long-term data , to become a first-line antidepressant option."
" Several studies showed consistent and statistically significant correlations between objective  behavioral  features collected via  mobile and wearable devices  and depressive  mood  symptoms . Hence , continuous and everyday monitoring of behavioral aspects in affective disorders could be a promising supplementary objective measure for estimating depressive  mood  symptoms . However , the evidence is limited by method ological issues in individual studies and by a lack of st and ardization of ( 1 ) the collected objective features , ( 2 ) the mood assessment methodology , and ( 3 ) the statistical methods applied . Therefore , consistency in data collection and analysis in future studies is needed , making replication studies as well as meta-analyses possible."
"nDifficulties  in set-shifting  are commonly reported in both  autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) and anorexia nervosa ( AN ) population  s. Despite this , it is not known whether this cognitive profile persists across different ages , or whether the profiles seen in ASD and AN are comparable . This systematic review and meta-analyses aim ed to compare the  set-shifting profiles  , as measured by the   Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST )   in  adults and younger people with either ASD or AN  , relative to  healthy  controls ( HCs ) and to statistically compare performance on the WCST between ASD and AN . In all ,  24 studies on ASD and 22 studies on AN were identified .  In ASD , there were significant differences between the clinical group and HCs , with the ASD group making significantly more  perseverative errors  , indicating greater  difficulty  in  set-shifting  [ pooled effect size of d = 0.67 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.53 - 0.81 , p ⩽ 0.001 ] . This effect was consistent across the age span . For AN studies , there was a significant difference between adults with AN and HCs ( d = 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.36 - 0.68 , p ⩽ 0.001 ) but a non-significant effect in child studies ( d = 0.25 , 95 % CI -0.05 to 0.55 , z = 1.66 ,  p  =  0.096  ) . Meta-regression indicated no  effect of diagnosis (  AN  or  ASD  )  on performance in adult studies but there was a non-significant trend ( p = 0.053 ) towards  children with  ASD  performing worse  than children with AN .  While difficulties with set-shifting  appear to be stable in ASD , there may be differences between  children and adults with AN  , which warrant further investigation."
"yWe aim ed to synthesis e evidence to assess the effect and safety of  NaFeEDTA  on  Hb  and   serum  ferritin in Fe-deficient population s.  We performed a systematic review , identifying potential studies by search ing the electronic data bases of Medline , Cochrane Library , Embase , WHO Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure . We also h and - search ed relevant conference proceedings and reference lists . Finally , we contacted experts in the field . The selection criteria included r and omised or quasi-r and omised controlled trials of  NaFeEDTA compared  with  placebo .   Hb , serum ferritin and adverse effects  were outcomes of interest . Inclusion decisions , quality assessment and data extraction were performed by two review ers independently  . Seven studies met the inclusion criteria .  All included studies assessed the effect of  NaFeEDTA  on  Hb concentration  , four studies assessed the effect on  serum ferritin concentration  , and one study on  serum Zn concentration .  After the intervention ,  Hb concentration and serum ferritin concentration  were both higher in the  NaFeEDTA  group compared with the control group . For  Hb  , data from six studies could be pooled and the pooled estimate ( weighted mean difference ) was 8.56 ( 95 % CI 2.21 , 14.90 ) g/l ( P = 0.008 ) . For  serum ferritin  , data from four studies could be pooled and the pooled difference was 1.58 ( 95 % CI 1.20 , 2.09 ) microg/l ( P < 0.001 ) . Subgroup analysis indicated that a lower  baseline Hb level  was associated with a greater increase  in Hb concentration .  No significant difference in  serum Zn concentration  was found . We concluded that  NaFeEDTA  increased both  Hb concentration and serum ferritin concentration  substantially  in Fe-deficient population s  , and could be an effective Fe preparation to combat Fe deficiency."
"sBackground Little is known about the most effective  occupational health and safety ( OHS ) interventions  to reduce   upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders ( MSDs )  and injuries .  Methods A systematic review used a best evidence synthesis approach to address the question : “ do  occupational health and safety interventions  have an effect on upper extremity musculoskeletal symptoms , signs , disorders , injuries , cl aims and lost time ? ” Results The search identified  36 studies of sufficient method ological quality  to be included in data extraction and evidence synthesis . Overall , a mixed level of evidence was found for  OHS interventions .  Levels of evidence for interventions associated with positive effects were : Moderate evidence for arm supports ; and Limited evidence for  ergonomics training plus workstation adjustments  , new chair and  rest breaks .  Levels of evidence for interventions associated with “ no effect ” were : Strong evidence for workstation adjustment alone ; Moderate evidence for  biofeedback training  and  job stress management training ;  and Limited evidence for  cognitive behavioral training .  No interventions were associated with “ negative effects ” . Conclusion It is difficult to make strong evidence d-based recommendations about what practitioners should do to prevent or manage upper extremity MSDs . There is a paucity of high quality  OHS  interventions evaluating upper extremity MSDs and none focused on  traumatic injury outcomes  or  workplace m and ated pre-placement screening exams .  We recommend that worksites not engage in  OHS  activities that include only workstation adjustments . However , when combined with ergonomics training , there is limited evidence that workstation adjustments are beneficial . A practice to consider is using arm supports to reduce upper extremity MSDs."
"tModafinil is an FDA -approved eugeroic that directly increases cortical catecholamine levels , indirectly upregulates cerebral serotonin , glutamate , orexin , and histamine levels , and indirectly decreases cerebral gamma-amino-butrytic acid levels . In addition to its approved use treating excessive somnolence ,  modafinil  is thought to be used widely off-prescription for cognitive enhancement . However , despite this popularity , there has been little consensus on the extent and nature of the cognitive effects of modafinil in  healthy , non-sleep-deprived humans .  This problem is compounded by method ological discrepancies within the literature , and reliance on psychometric tests design ed to detect cognitive effects in ill rather than healthy population s. In order to provide an up-to- date systematic evaluation that addresses these concerns , we search ed MEDLINE with the terms  "" modafinil ""  and  ""  cognitive  ""  , and review ed all result ant  primary studies in English from January 1990 until December 2014  investigating the cognitive actions of modafinil  in healthy non-sleep-deprived humans .  We found that whilst most studies employing basic testing paradigms show that modafinil intake enhances  executive function  , only half show improvements in  attention and learning and memory  , and a few even report impairments in  divergent creative thinking .  In contrast , when more complex assessment s are used , modafinil appears to consistently engender enhancement of  attention , executive functions , and learning .  Importantly , we did not observe any preponderances for  side effects or mood changes .  Finally , in light of the method ological discrepancies encountered within this literature , we conclude with a series of recommendations on how to optimally detect valid , robust , and consistent effects in healthy population s that should aid future assessment of neuroenhancement."

"OBackground Major psychiatric disorders are growing public health concern that attributed 14 % of the global burden of diseases . The management of major psychiatric disorders is challenging mainly due to medication non-adherence . However , there is a paucity of summarized evidence on the prevalence of  psychotropic medication  non-adherence and associated factors . Therefore , we aim ed to summarize existing primary studies ’ finding to determine the pooled prevalence and factors associated with  psychotropic medication  non-adherence . Methods  A total of 4504 studies written in English until December 31 , 2017 , were search ed from the main data bases ( n = 3125 )  ( PubMed ( MEDLINE ) , Embase , CINAHL , PsycINFO , and Web of Science ) and other relevant sources ( mainly from Google Scholar , n = 1379 ) . Study selection , screening , and data extraction were carried out independently by two authors .  Observational studies  that had been  conducted among adult patients ( 18 years and older ) with major psychiatric disorders  were eligible for the selection process . Critical appraisal of the included studies was carried out using the  Newcastle Ottawa Scale  . Systematic synthesis of the studies was carried out to summarize factors associated with  psychotropic medication  non-adherence . Meta- analysis was carried using Stata 14 . R and om effects model was used to compute the pooled prevalence , and sub-group analysis at 95 % confidence interval . Results  Forty-six studies were included in the systematic review .  Of these , 35  studies  ( schizophrenia ( n = 9 ) , depressive ( n = 16 ) , and bipolar ( n = 10 ) disorders ) were included in the meta- analysis . Overall , 49 % of major psychiatric disorder patients were  non-adherent  to their  psychotropic medication  . Of these ,   psychotropic medication  non-adherence  for schizophrenia , major depressive disorders , and bipolar disorders were 56 % , 50 % , and 44 % , respectively .  Individual patient ’s behaviors , lack of social support , clinical or treatment and illness-related , and health system factors  influenced  psychotropic medication  non-adherence . Conclusion  Psychotropic medication  non-adherence was high . It was influenced by various factors operating at different levels . Therefore , comprehensive intervention strategies should be design ed to address factors associated with psychotropic medication non-adherence . Systematic review registration PROSPERO."

"yTo up date a comparative effectiveness review ( 1980–2011 ) of treatments for  adolescents whose depressive episode or disorder ( MDE/MDD ) did not respond to one or more trials of  SSRI antidepressants .   MEDLINE , Cochrane Central , PsychINFO , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s , EMBASE , CINAHL , and AMED were search ed in addition to the grey literature .  We spanned May 2011 to September 1 , 2017 and included only articles in English .  11 new studies were review ed based on the criteria of having tested a comparative treatment in  adolescents with MDD or MDE who were  confirmed  to have failed one or more SSRI trials .  Data were extracted using st and ardized forms and a reference guide in DistillerSR ; a second review er verified the accuracy of the data fields and discrepancies were resolved by consensus . One trial  ( N = 29 )  found a  small benefit  of escalating  doses  of   fluoxetine   and the treatment of   adolescent depression   study (  TORDIA , N = 334  ) found significant  benefits  of  combined SSRI or venlafaxine treatment with CBT  for most  outcomes  . No new studies were identified since the previous review ( 2012 ) . One trial is currently registered that will be a cross over trial of rTMS ; other registered trials are open label . Multiple secondary  data  analyses of TORDIA have identified  important predictors of treatment response and relapse .  No new comparative studies were identified since the original review . Trials are desperately needed to identify new treatments for youth with SSRI resistant MDD . These youth should not be deemed as treatment resistant until completing one or two failed trials of SSRI combined with evidence -based psychotherapy."
"dThe following aims were set for this systematic literature review : ( a ) to make an inventory of existing methods to achieve  bondable surfaces on oxide ceramics  and ( b ) to evaluate which methods might provide sufficient bond strength . Current literature of in vitro studies regarding bond  strength  achieved using different  surface treatments on  oxide ceramics in  combination with adhesive  cement systems   was selected from PubMed and systematic ally analyzed and completed with reference tracking . The total number of  publications  included for aim a  was 127 studies , 23 of which were used for aim b.  The surface treatments are divided into seven main groups :  as-produced , grinding/polishing , airborne particle abrasion , surface coating , laser treatment , acid treatment , and primer treatment .  There are large variations , making comparison of the studies difficult . An as-produced surface of oxide ceramic needs to be surface treated to achieve  durable bond strength . Abrasive surface treatment and /or silica-coating treatment  with the use of primer treatment can provide sufficient  bond strength  for  bonding oxide ceramics .  This conclusion , however , needs to be confirmed by clinical studies . There is no universal surface treatment . Consideration should be given to the specific material s to be cemented and to the adhesive cement system to be used."

"dThe management of  oral submucous fibrosis ( OSF )  is quite challenging , and as yet , no effective therapy is available for its management . The present systematic review and meta- analysis sought to assess the effectiveness of  aloe vera  in alleviating  pain and clinical signs of  OSF .   A comprehensive search in PubMed / Medline , Scopus , and Web of Science data bases was conducted to identify the relevant r and omized clinical trials . RevMan 5.3 software was used for data analysis .  Six r and omized controlled trials  fulfilled the inclusion criteria . The results of meta- analysis showed statistically significant differences between  aloe vera  and control groups in  alleviating pain/burning sensation  at the end of the first and second month , in favor of aloe vera , but no significant differences were found at the end of the third month . With regard to  objective clinical outcomes  , no statistically significant differences were found between the groups .  Aloe vera  has a promising effect in  reducing pain/burning sensation  and  clinical improvement in  patients with  OSF .  However , owing to the marked heterogeneity of the included studies , conducting well- design ed trials with long follow-up periods , st and ardized outcome measures and adequate sample sizes are warranted."

"yOBJECTIVE the positive effect of  physical training  in  healthy elderly people  is well documented . The aim of this systematic review was to describe the effect of  physical training  on  physical performance  in  institutionalised elderly patients with multiple diagnoses .  DESIGN systematic literature review of r and omised controlled trials regarding effects of  physical training  of  elderly ( 70 + ) subjects .  METHODS the r and omised controlled trials were evaluated using a modified version of an evaluation form originally developed by the Cochrane Collaboration . It is based on a weighted scale of 0 - 100 points , and ranks the studies as high , moderate or low method ological quality . A  total of 16 r and omised controlled trials were included in the review  . RESULTS six studies scored as high quality , eight as moderate and two as low . There was a large heterogeneity in the studies concerning sample size , types of interventions and types of  assessment s.  There is strong evidence for a positive effect of   physical training   on  muscle strength and mobility ;  moderate evidence for an effect on  range of motion ;  and contradictory evidence regarding  gait , activities of daily living , balance and endurance .   more studies are required , with larger sample sizes , higher specificity as to the types of interventions and assessment s , greater focus on clinical ly relevant outcomes such as  endurance and activities of daily living  , and also , for example , quality of life and mortality."
"sAmphetamine-type substances are frequently detected among  drivers injured or killed due to road-trauma .  However , the role of this substance in crash causation remains equivocal . We performed a systematic review to evaluate existing evidence regarding the association between  amphetamine  use and the risk of injury or death due to  road traffic accidents .  A bibliographical search of PubMed , SafetyLit , Scopus , and Science Direct literature data bases from  01 January 1980 until  May  2015  was performed . The quality of included studies was assessed using  the Newcastle-Ottowa Scale ( NOS )  ( cut-off of ≥7 indicated high quality ) .  Inter-rater reliability  between three independent review ers for the NOS was calculated using Cohens kappa ( κ ) statistic , and best- evidence synthesis was performed .  A total of 182 articles were found . Nine studies met  eligibility criteria for inclusion for review , and  seven studies  were included for best- evidence synthesis . Best- evidence synthesis demonstrated a conflicting level of evidence for associations between the use of-amphetamine-type substances and the  risk of sustaining an injury  , and a moderate level of evidence between amphetamine use and the  risk of death due to road trauma  . This is the first review to synthesis e evidence regarding the association between amphetamine-type substance use  and the risk of injury or death due to a road traffic accident .  More conclusive evidence  of death due to road trauma  among amphetamine users may reflect significant and global deficits in functioning associated with effective vehicular control under the influence of this substance . Additional high quality , sufficiently powered studies are required to eluci date the magnitude of these associations."
"hBackground The use of  financial incentives or pay-for-performance programs  for  health care providers  has triggered emerging interest in the use of  financial incentives  for encouraging health behaviour change . Purpose This paper aims to identify key conditions under which the use of  financial incentives  for improvements in public  health  outcomes is most likely to be effective and appropriate . Methods We review recent systematic review s on their effectiveness in changing health behaviour and identify existing moral concerns concerning personal  financial incentives .  Results Current evidence indicates that  incentives  can be effective in  driving health behaviour change  under certain provisos , while a number of misgivings continue to be deliberated on . We outline a number of key principles for consideration in decisions about the potential use of  incentives  in leading to public health improvements . Conclusion These key principles can assist policy makers in making decisions on the use of  financial incentives  directed at achieving improvements in public health."

Other  balance measures  did not show a difference in effect . Results from two studies suggest that  circuit class therapy  can reduce  length of hospital stay  ( mean difference -19.7 days , 95 % confidence interval -35.4 to -4.0 ) . Two studies measured  adverse events ( falls ) ;  all were minor .   Circuit class therapy  is safe and  effective  in improving  mobility  in  people after stroke  and , when provided as part of hospital-based rehabilitation , may reduce length of stay."
"sABSTRACT Objective : We aim to report a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on effects of  olive oil consumption  compared with other  plant oils  on blood lipids . Methods : PubMed , web of science , Scopus , ProQuest , and Embase were systematic ally search ed until September 2017 , with no age , language and design restrictions . Weighed mean difference ( WMD ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) were expressed as effect size . Sensitivity analyses and pre specified subgroup was conducted to evaluate potential heterogeneity . Meta-regression analyses were performed to investigate association between  blood lipid-lowering  effects of  olive oil  and duration of treatment . Results :  Twenty-seven trials , comprising 1089 participants met the eligibility criteria .  Results of this study showed that compared to other plant  oils , high-density lipoprotein level increased  significantly more for OO ( 1.37 mg/dl : 95 % CI : 0.4 , 2.36 ) . Also OO  consumption reduced total cholesterol ( TC )  ( 6.27 mg/dl , 95 % CI : 2.8 ,  10.6 ) , Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL-c )  ( 4.2 mg/dl , 95 % CI : 1.4 , 7.01  )  ,  and triglyceride ( TG )  ( 4.31 mg/dl , 95 % CI : 0.5 , 8.12 ) significantly less than other plant oils . There were no significant effects  on Apo lipoprotein A1 and Apo lipoprotein B.  Conclusion : This meta- analysis suggested that OO consumption  decreased serum TC , LDL-c , and TG less  but  increased HDL-c  more than other plant oils."
"sExcessive sedentary time is detrimentally linked to obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease and premature mortality . Studies have been investigating the use of  activity-permissive workstations  to reduce  sedentary time  in  office workers  , a highly  sedentary  target group . This review systematic ally summarizes the evidence for  activity-permissive workstations  on  sedentary time , health-risk biomarkers , work performance  and  feasibility indicators  in office workplaces . In July 2013 , a literature search identified  38  relevant peer-  review  ed publications . Key findings were independently extracted by two research ers . The average intervention effect on  sedentary time  was calculated via meta- analysis .  In total , 984 participants across 19 field-based trials and 19 laboratory investigations were included , with sample sizes ranging from n = 2 to 66 per study .   Sedentary time , health-risk biomarkers and work performance indicators  were reported in 13 , 23 and 23 studies , respectively . The pooled effect size from the meta- analysis was -77 min of  sedentary time/8-h workday  ( 95 % confidence interval = -120 , -35 min ) .  Non-significant  changes were reported for most  health- and work-related outcomes .  Studies with  acceptability measures  reported predominantly positive feedback . Findings suggest  that activity-permissive workstations  can be effective to reduce  occupational sedentary time  , without compromising  work performance .  Larger and longer-term r and omized-controlled trials are needed to underst and the sustainability of the  sedentary  time reductions and their longer-term impacts on health- and work-related outcomes."

"sAlthough atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common sustained arrhythmia seen during daily cardiovascular physician practice , its management remained a challenge for cardiology physician as there was no single anti-arrhythmic agents proved to be effective in converting atrial fibrillation and kept its effectiveness in maintaining  sinus rhythm  over long term . Moreover all the  anti-arrhythmic  agents that are used in treatment of AF were potentially pro-arrhythmic especially in  patients with coronary artery disease and structurally abnormal heart .  Some of these drugs also have serious  non cardiac side effects  that limit its long term use in the management of atrial fibrillation . Several new and investigational anti-arrhythmic agents are emerging but data supporting their effectiveness and safety are still limited . In this systematic review we examine the  efficacy and safety  of these medications supported by the major published r and omized trials , meta-analyses and review articles and conclude with a summary of guidelines recommendations."
 The present systematic review provides evidence for beneficial effects of long-term interventions administering a  low glycemic index/load diet  with respect to fasting insulin and pro-inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein which might prove to be helpful in the primary prevention of obesity-associated diseases.
")Public health guidelines suggest that  physical activity  can be accumulated in multiple short bouts dispersed through the day . A synthesis of the evidence for this approach is lacking . Our objective was to undertake a systematic review and meta- analysis to examine if  exercise interventions consisting of a single bout of exercise compared with interventions comprising the same total duration , mode , and intensity of exercise accumulated over the course of the  day have different effects on  health  outcomes  in adults . Six electronic  data bases were search ed ( Jan 1970–29 August 2018 ) . Two authors identified studies that evaluated the effects of a  single bout of exercise  compared with  the same intensity , total duration , and mode of exercise accumulated in multiple bouts over the course of a  day , in  community-dwelling adults .  Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool . Pooled effects were reported as st and ardised mean differences ( MDs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) using a r and om effects model .  A total of 19 studies involving 1080 participants met the inclusion criteria .  There were no differences between accumulated and continuous groups for  any cardiorespiratory fitness or blood pressure outcomes .  A difference was found  in body mass changes  from baseline to post-intervention in favour  of accumulated exercise  compared with  continuous  ( MD − 0.92 kg , 95 % CI − 1.59 to − 0.25 , I2 = 0 % ; five studies , 211 participants ) . In subgroup  analyses  ,  accumulating > 150 min of weekly exercise  in multiple bouts per day result ed in  small effects on body fat percentage  ( combined post-intervention and change from baseline values : MD − 0.87 % , 95 % CI − 1.71 to − 0.04 , I2 = 0 % ; three studies , 166 participants ) compared with  150 min of  exercise amassed via single  continuous  bouts per day . There was a  decrease in low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol   with accumulated versus continuous exercise  ( MD − 0.39 mmol/l , 95 % CI − 0.73 to − 0.06 , I2 = 23 % ; two studies , 41 participants ) . No differences were observed for  any other blood biomarker ( total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglycerides , fasting blood glucose , and fasting insulin )  . There is no difference  between continuous and accumulated patterns of exercise  in  terms of effects on fitness , blood pressure , lipids , insulin and glucose .  There is some evidence from a small number of studies that  changes in body mass and LDL cholesterol  are more favourable following the accumulated condition . Collectively our findings suggest  that adults  are likely to accrue similar health benefits from  exercising in a single bout  or  accumulating activity  from shorter bouts throughout the day . This review will inform public health guidelines for physical activity at the global and national levels ( PROSPERO 2016 CRD42016044122 )."
" At the initial evaluation of  patients with rotator cuff tear  , there was an association between self-reported function and pain  and emotional or mental health .  However , these factors were not associated with patient-reported outcomes after intervention . This finding could be attributed to the lack of large prospect i ve studies in this area or complex phenotypes within this patient population . Preoperative patient expectation is an important predictor of patient-reported outcomes in  patients after rotator cuff surgery  and may be a modifiable target for enhancing recovery .

"sABSTRACT  Hospitalization  may induce a decrease of muscle strength and muscle mass in  older patients due to physical inactivity , malnutrition and diseases  , negatively affecting health outcome . We aim ed to examine the literature on change in muscle strength and muscle mass in  older patients during hospitalization .  A literature search was performed in major electronic data bases from inception to March 2016 .  Studies including hospitalized patients with a mean age ≥ 65 years , describing change of h and grip strength  and  /or muscle  mass were found eligible . Extracted data were divided in h and grip strength or muscle mass and stratified by elective or acute admission . Meta‐ analysis was conducted using Comprehensive Meta‐ analysis .  Twenty‐five studies were included , describing a total of 1789 patients with a mean age range of 65 to 85.8 years and an overall median length of stay of 14.7 days  .  Pooled h and grip strength and muscle mass  were found to significantly decrease in electively admitted older patients during hospitalization ( st and ardized mean difference ( 95 % confidence interval ) : − 0.42 ( − 0.66 , − 0.17 ) and − 0.44 ( − 0.61 , − 0.27 ) ) , but not in acutely admitted older patients ( st and ardized mean difference ( 95 % confidence interval ) : 0.18 ( − 0.02 , 0.37 ) and − 0.25 ( − 0.58 , 0.09 ) ) . In conclusion ,  decrease in muscle strength and muscle mass  in  older patients  is dependent on the type of admission . HIGHLIGHTSPhysical inactivity during hospitalization is associated with detrimental  outcome .Muscle strength and muscle mass  decreased in electively admitted older  patients .Muscle strength and muscle mass  did not change in acutely admitted older patients."
"sBACKGROUND :  Telemedicine  , the use of  telecommunications  to deliver health services , expertise and information , is a promising but unproven tool for improving the  quality  of   diabetes care   . We summarized the effectiveness of different methods of  telemedicine  for the management of diabetes compared with usual care . METHODS : We search ed MEDLINE , Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  data bases (  to  November 2015 )  and reference lists of existing systematic review s for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing  telemedicine with usual care  for  adults with diabetes .  Two independent review ers selected the studies and assessed risk of bias in the studies . The primary outcome was  glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1C )  reported at 3 time points ( ⩽ 3 mo , 4–12 mo and > 12 mo ) . Other outcomes were  quality of life , mortality and episodes of hypoglycemia  . Trials were pooled using r and omeffects meta- analysis , and heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic . RESULTS :  From 3688 citations , we identified 111 eligible RCTs ( n = 23 648 )  .  Telemedicine  achieved significant but modest reductions  in HbA1C  in all 3 follow-up periods ( difference in mean at ⩽ 3 mo : −0.57 % , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] −0.74 % to −0.40 % [ 39 trials ] ; at 4–12 mo : −0.28 % , 95 % CI −0.37 % to −0.20 % [ 87 trials ] ; and at > 12 mo : −0.26 % , 95 % CI −0.46 % to −0.06 % [ 5 trials ] ) .  Quantified heterogeneity  ( I2 statistic ) was 75 % , 69 % and 58 % , respectively . In meta-regression analyses , the effect  of telemedicine  on  HbA1C  appeared greatest in trials with higher HbA1C concentrations at baseline , in trials where providers used Web portals or text messaging to communicate with patients and in trials where  telemedicine  facilitated medication adjustment  . Telemedicine  had no convincing effect  on quality of life , mortality or hypoglycemia  . INTERPRETATION : Compared with usual care , the  addition of telemedicine  , especially systems that allowed medication adjustments with or without text messaging or a Web portal ,  improved  HbA1C but not other clinical ly relevant outcomes among  patients with  diabetes."
"MIntroduction  Appendectomy  has long been the mainstay of intervention for  acute appendicitis  , aim ing at preventing  perforation , peritonitis  ,  abscess formation  and  recurrence .  With better underst and ing of the disease process ,  non-operative management ( NOM ) with antibiotics  alone has been proved a feasible treatment for uncomplicated  appendicitis  . This article aim ed at systematic ally review ing the available literature s and discussing the question whether  NOM  should replace  appendectomy  as the st and ard first-line treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis . Method A search of the Embase , Pubmed and Cochrane Library was performed using the keywords ‘  acute appendicitis  ’ and  ‘ antibiotic therapy ’ .  Meta- analysis with inverse variance model for continuous variable and Mantel Haenzel Model for dichotomous variable was performed to evaluate the  one year treatment efficacy , morbidities rate , sick leave duration and length of hospital stay  associated with emergency  appendectomy  and  NOM  . Results  Six r and omized control trials  were identified out of  1943 publications  . NOM had a significant  lower treatment efficacy rate  at one year , 0.10 ( 95 % CI 0.03–0.36 , p < 0.01 ) , when compared to  appendectomy  . The  morbidities rate  was comparable between the two interventions .  The length of hospital stay  was longer , with a mean difference of 1.08 days ( 95 % CI 0.09–2.07 , p = 0.03 ) , and  the sick leave  duration was shorter , a mean difference of 3.37 days ( 95 % CI -5.90 to −0.85 days , p < 0.01 ) for NOM . Conclusion The paradigm remains unchanged , that  appendectomy  is the gold st and ard of treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis , given its higher efficacy rate when compared to NOM."

"OAdipose tissue is considered as an endocrine organ , which is developed in specific depots , distinguished either as subcutaneous or visceral .  Lipectomy , by means of liposuction or abdominoplasty  , is a common plastic surgery procedure , which can remove substantial amounts of subcutaneous fat . This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of  surgical removal of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue  on   body weight and fat mass  in females  in the short- and long-term . A systematic review was conducted using a predetermined protocol established according to the Cochrane H and book ’s recommendations . PubMed , Scopus , CENTRAL , and the Cochrane Library were search ed from inception to December 2014 . Eligible studies were prospect i ve  studies  with ≥1  month of follow-up  that  included female only individuals who  underwent lipectomy  of the abdominal region and reported  on body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , or fat mass .  Ten studies were included in this systematic review with a total of 231 individuals .  A  significant weight loss and BMI improvement  were reported in 4 out of 5 studies with a mean follow-up of 1–2 months , but in none of the 5 studies with a longer follow-up  ( 3–20 months ) . Fat mass  showed a similar to weight change . The risk of bias was low for the two clinical trials but high for the observational studies included in the review . This systematic review revealed only a transient  effect  of abdominal lipectomy  in body fat and weight  in women   , which fades a few months after the operation . These results corroborate the evidence from experimental and clinical studies , which support  fat redistribution and compensatory fat growth  , as a result of feedback mechanisms , triggered by fat removal . Additional clinical studies , with adequate follow-up , may further eluci date the long-term effects  of abdominal lipectomy   in body  weight and composition .

"nBackground  Electrically assisted bicycles ( e-bikes )  have been highlighted as a method of active travel that could overcome some of the commonly reported barriers to cycle commuting . The objective of this systematic review was to assess the  health benefits  associated with  e-cycling .  Method A systematic literature review of studies examining   physical activity , cardiorespiratory , metabolic and psychological outcomes  associated with  e-cycling .   Where possible these outcomes were compared to those from  conventional cycling  and  walking .   Seven electronic data bases , clinical trial registers , grey literature and  reference lists were search ed up to November 2017 . H and search ing occurred until June 2018 . Experimental or observational studies examining the impact of  e-cycling  on  physical activity  and /or  health outcomes  of interest were included .  E-bikes  used must have pedals and require pedalling for electric assistance to be provided . Results  Seventeen  studies ( 11 acute experiments , 6 longitudinal interventions ) were identified  involving a total of 300 participants .  There was moderate evidence that   e-cycling  provided physical activity of at least moderate intensity  , which was lower than the intensity elicited during  conventional cycling  , but higher than that during walking . There was also moderate evidence that   e-cycling  can improve cardiorespiratory fitness  in  physically inactive individuals .  Evidence of the impact of  e-cycling   on metabolic and psychological health outcomes  was inconclusive . Longitudinal evidence was compromised by weak study design and quality .  Conclusion E-cycling  can contribute to meeting physical activity recommendations and increasing physical fitness . As such ,  e-bikes  offer a potential alternative to  conventional cycling .  Future research should examine the long-term health impacts of  e-cycling  using rigorous research design."

"sPolymerization shrinkage of  resin composite  can compromise the  longevity of restorations .  To minimize this problem , the monomeric composition of composites have been modified . The objective of this study was to conduct a meta- analysis to assess the clinical behavior of  restorations performed with  low polymerization shrinkage resin composite   in comparison with  traditional methacrylates-based resin composite .  This systematic review was registered at Prospero data system ( CRD42015023940 ) . Studies were search ed in the electronic data bases PubMed , Web of Science , Scopus , Lilacs and EMBASE according to a predefined search strategy . The inclusion criteria were as follow :  ( 1 ) r and omized controlled clinical trials with at least six months of follow-up ; ( 2 ) studies investigating composites with  monomers  design ed to reduce polymerization shrinkage ; ( 3 ) studies conducted with class I or II restorations in the permanent dentition ; and ( 4 ) studies that assessed at least one of the  following criteria :  marginal integrity/adaptation , marginal discoloration , recurent caries , retention of composite restorations , and postoperative sensitivity .  Two independent review ers analyzed the articles to determine inclusion and risk of bias . The search conducted in the data bases result ed in a total of  14,217 studies .  After review ing the references and citations , 21 articles remained . The longest clinical follow-up time was 60 months . The meta- analysis of the data in the included studies demonstrated that only one variable  ( marginal adaptation after 12 months )  showed statistically significant outcomes , in which  methacrylates-based composites  presented significantly better results than  resin composites containing modified monomers .  The good level of the scientific evidence as well as the overall low risk of bias of the included studies indicate that composites with silorane , ormocer or bulk-fill type modified monomers have a clinical performance similar to conventional resin composites."

"sContext  Human growth hormone ( GH )  is widely sold and used as an antiaging agent . Contributions The research ers review ed all clinical trials of  GH  to determine if it is safe and effective in the  healthy elderly .  They found that GH had no important  effects on body composition  but led to  frequent adverse effects  , most notably  soft tissue edema and arthralgias .  Caution s Clinical trials of  GH  have been small , and they may not have been able to detect important differences . Implication s Published data about  GH  use in the elderly is limited , but available evidence suggests that risks far outweigh benefits when it is used as an antiaging treatment in healthy older  adults  . The Editors Since the 1990 publication of an article by Rudman and colleagues ( 1 ) suggesting that a short course of  recombinant human growth hormone ( GH ) therapy  could reverse decades of age-related changes in body composition in  otherwise healthy elderly men  , the use of  GH  as an antiaging therapy has increased rapidly in the United States and worldwide ( 2 ) . Interest in Rudman and colleagues ' results has remained high ( 3 ) , spawning several popular books in the lay press ( 47 ) .  Use of  GH   as an  antiaging therapy  ranks as 1 of the most popular health-related Internet search es ( 8) . Although the exact number of people who use  GH  as an  antiaging  therapy is unknown , Perls and colleagues ( 2 ) reported that 20000 to 30000  people  used  GH  in the United States as an  antiaging therapy  in 2004 ( 9 ) , a more than 10-fold increase since the mid-1990s ( 10 , 11 ) .  Annual sales of GH  worldwide exceed $ 1.5 billion ( 2 ) , one third of which may be for off-label use ( 12 ) . Proponents of  GH  for its  antiaging  properties cl aim ed that more than 100000 people received GH without a prescription in 2002 ( 2 , 11 ) . The rationale for using  GH  as an antiaging therapy , referred to by some as the sweet syringe of youth ( 10 ) , lies in the age-related decline in activity of the hypothalamic growth hormoneinsulin-like growth factor axis , a phenomenon referred to as the somatopause ( 1319 ) . Some signs and symptoms of GH deficiency ( that is , GH deficiency due to hypothalamic or pituitary defects ) , such as  increased adiposity and decreased lean body mass  , are similar to changes that occur with aging , suggesting that GH replacement therapy may ameliorate age-related changes . Although  GH  therapy improves  body composition  ( 20 ) ,  bone density  ( 20 , 21 ) , and  cholesterol levels  ( 22 ) and may decrease  death  ( 23 ) in  people who are GH-deficient  , its  safety  , efficacy , and role in the  healthy elderly  is highly controversial ( 24 ) . Whereas proponents of GH have recommended its use for treating the somatopause ( 18 , 19 , 25 , 26 ) , others , including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ( 27 ) , have warned that such therapy is not warranted . High levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , which are regulated by GH levels , may be associated with serious adverse events ( 12 ) , including prostate cancer ( 28 ) . Furthermore , the distribution of GH for use as an antiaging therapy in the United States is illegal ( 2 ) . We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized , controlled trials to determine the  safety and efficacy  of  GH therapy  in the healthy elderly . We aim ed to evaluate the effects of GH on  body composition , exercise capacity , bone density , serum lipid levels , and glucose metabolism .  In addition , we sought to synthesize the evidence on  adverse events  associated with GH use in the healthy elderly . Methods Literature Search es An author and a professional librarian developed search strategies to identify potentially relevant studies . We search ed MEDLINE  and EMBASE data bases  for  English- language studies published through 21 November 2005  using keywords including growth hormone ; aging ; and r and omized , controlled clinical trials ( Appendix Table 1 ) . We search ed bibliographies of retrieved articles for additional studies . Appendix Table 1 . Search Strategy Study Selection We sought 2 types of r and omized , controlled trials : those that compared  injectable GH therapy with no GH therapy  and those that compared  injectable GH therapy plus lifestyle interventions (  that is ,  exercise with or without a dietary intervention ) with lifestyle interventions alone .   We included studies that : 1 ) evaluated at least 10 participants ; 2 ) included participants who received  GH therapy  for 2 weeks or more ; 3 ) enrolled only community-dwelling participants ; 4 ) assessed participants with a mean body mass index of 35 kg/m2 or less and a mean age of 50 years or more ;  and 5 ) provided data on at least 1 clinical outcome of interest . We excluded studies that : 1 ) focused solely on evaluating GH-releasing factor , other GH secretagogues , or IGF-1 ; 2 )  explicitly included patients with diabetes mellitus , cardiac disease , thyroid disease , osteoporosis , or cancer ;  or 3 ) evaluated  GH  as a treatment for a specific illness ( for example , adult GH deficiency , the  HIV wasting syndrome , renal failure , or critical illness )  . Data Abstract ion An author review ed the titles and abstract s of articles identified through our search and retrieved potentially relevant studies .  Two physicians with postdoctoral training in health services research , endocrinology , or both review ed  each retrieved study and abstract ed data independently onto pretested abstract ion forms . We resolved abstract ion differences by repeated review . If a study did not present data necessary for analysis , mentioned results but did not present data , or presented data graphically , we requested additional data from study authors . If several studies presented findings from the same cohort , we used these data only once in our analysis . Abstract ed Data We abstract ed 4 types of data from each study : 1 ) study quality ( for example , quality of r and omization , blinding , outcomes , and statistical analyses ) ( 29 , 30 ) ; 2 ) study sample characteristics ( for example , age , sex , weight , medical conditions , and baseline IGF-1 levels ) ; 3 ) study interventions ( for example , dosage , frequency , and length of GH therapy ) ; and 4 )  clinical outcomes  . We included studies that provided data on at least 1 of the following 6 clinical outcomes of interest :  1 ) body composition (  for example ,  weight , lean body or fat-free mass , or fat mass ) ; 2 ) strength or functional capacity ( for example  ,  h and grip strength or maximal rate of oxygen consumption ) ; 3 ) bone dynamics (  for example ,  femoral neck or lumbar spine bone mineral density or bone mineral content ) ; 4 ) cardiovascular risk factors (  for example ,  heart rate , total , low-density lipoprotein , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or triglyceride levels ) ; 5 ) insulin resistance markers (  for  example  ,  fasting glucose and insulin levels and 2-hour glucose post75-gram oral glucose tolerance test results ) ; 5 ) quality -of-life or depression scales ; or 6 ) adverse events .  Because the terms lean body mass and fat-free mass are typically used interchangeably in scientific literature , we combined data on fat-free mass and lean body mass into the single category of lean body mass . Quantitative Data Synthesis To describe key study characteristics , we computed mean values weighted by the number of participants in each trial . To evaluate the effects of GH on the outcomes of interest , we computed a change score for each clinical outcome for participants in the treatment and control groups as the value of the outcome at the end of the trial minus the value of the outcome at the start of the trial . We then used these change scores to calculate 2 study effect sizes : the Hedges ' adjusted g , which is an estimate of the st and ardized mean difference ( 31 ) , and the weighted mean difference ( 32 ) . We calculated both study effect sizes because the Hedges ' adjusted g , although an unbiased estimate , lacks units ; whereas the results of the weighted mean difference are in the same units as the clinical outcome of interest , facilitating clinical interpretation . Our results from either method did not substantially differ , and we present effect sizes calculated by using only the weighted mean difference . If studies reported st and ard errors , we converted them to st and ard deviations . For studies that did not report the  variance  of an outcome at the end of the trial minus that at the start of the trial , we calculated the variance as the sum of the variances at the start and end of the trial minus twice the covariance . Calculation of the covariance between the end of the trial and the start of the trial requires the correlations from individual patient data . Because these correlations were unavailable , we computed the correlation of the reported means , which ranged from 0.61 to 0.99 , and used values over this interval to estimate the covariance for each outcome . We chose a correlation of 0.80 as our baseline value , although the pooled effect sizes did not substantially change when we varied the correlation over the range of 0.61 to 0.99 . We combined studies by using the DerSimonian and Laird inverse variance weighted method ( r and om-effects model ) and the MantelHaenszel method ( fixed-effects model ) ( 31 , 32 ) . We present the results from only the r and om-effects model because of statistical heterogeneity in some clinical outcomes . For  body composition measures  , we calculated separate summary effect sizes for the following : 1 ) studies of groups receiving  GH  versus studies of groups not  receiving GH  ; 2 ) studies of  GH plus lifestyle interventions  versus  studies  of  lifestyle interventions alone  ; 3 )  studies  in which research ers administered  GH  for  less than  26 weeks versus  studies  in which they administered  GH  for 26 weeks or more ; and 4 )  study population s in which research  ers  evaluated only men  versus  studies evaluating only women .  Because few studies have reported outcomes other than  body composition measures  , we calculated a single effect size for other clinical outcomes . We evaluated the effects of study heterogeneity on our summary results . We sought sources of heterogeneity affecting  body composition  outcomes."
"yINTRODUCTION The  effectiveness  of a   tourniquet   in the case of  life-threatening hemorrhages of the extremities  is well recognized and led to the recommendations on  "" Tourniquet ""  of the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care ( DGAI ) in 2016 . The aim of this systematic review was to re-evaluate the current medical literature in relation to the published DGAI recommendations . MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on the analysis of all  studies published from January 2015 until January 2018 in the PubMed data bases  , the publicized recommendations for action on  "" Tourniquet ""  of the DGAI were critically re-evaluated . For this purpose , 17 questions on 6 subjects were formulated in advance . The systematic review followed the PRISMA recommendations and is registered in PROSPERO ( International prospect i ve register of systematic review s , Reg.-ID : CRD42018091528 ) . RESULTS Of the  284 studies identified with the keywords  tourniquet  and trauma in the period from January 2015 to January 2018 in PubMed  ,  50 original papers  discussing the  prehospital application  of  tourniquet   for life-threatening hemorrhage of the extremities  were included . The overall level of evidence is low . No article addressed any of the formulated questions with a prospect i ve r and omized interventional study . Scientific deductions could be found only in an indirect way in a descriptive manner .  The 50 original articles included in this qualitative , systematic review revealed that the  recommendations "" Tourniquet ""  of the DGAI published in 2016 are mostly still up to date despite an inhomogeneous study situation . A deviation occurred in the conversion of a  tourniquet  but due to the short prehospital treatment time in the civilian setting this is of little importance ; however , in the future a strict distinction should be made between  tourniquets  which were placed for tactical reasons and those placed as a medical necessity."
"2A growing body of evidence suggests  yogic practice s  may benefit  adults with type  2 diabetes  ( DM2 ) .  In this systematic review , we evaluate available evidence from prospect i ve controlled trials regarding the effects of  yoga-based programs  on specific  health  outcomes pertinent to DM2 management . To identify qualifying studies , we search ed nine data bases and scanned bibliographies of relevant review papers and all identified articles .  Controlled trials that did not target adults with diabetes , included only adults with type 1 diabetes , were under two-week duration , or did not include quantitative outcome data were excluded .   Study quality  was evaluated using  the PEDro scale .   Thirty-three papers reporting findings from 25 controlled trials ( 13 nonr and omized , 12 r and omized ) met our inclusion criteria ( N = 2170 participants ) .  Collectively , findings suggest that  yogic practice s  may promote significant improvements in several indices of importance in  DM2  management , including  glycemic control , lipid levels , and body composition .  More limited data suggest that  yoga  may also lower  oxidative stress and blood pressure ; enhance pulmonary and autonomic function , mood , sleep , and quality of life ;  and  reduce medication use  in adults with DM2 . However , given the method ological limitations of existing studies , additional high- quality investigations are required to confirm and further eluci date the potential benefits of  yoga programs  in population s with DM2."
">The aim of the present study was to compare the root  canal preparation  ability of  rotary nickel-titanium ( NiTi ) Hero 642 and K3 files  in  curved m and ibular or maxillary molars .  A  total of 40 extracted m and ibular molars with two separate mesial canals , an apical width of approximately size ≤15 and a root canal curvature of 15 - 30 ° were r and omly  divided into two groups and  instrumented using Hero 642  ( n=20 )  or K3 files  ( n=20 )  . Canal straightening , working length , transportation , cross-sectional area , minimum dentin thickness and the canal angle curvature degree  were examined , and a systematic review of the literature was conducted . No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups with  regard to the mean degree of straightening , mean change in working length , mean transportation , amount of dentin removed or remaining minimum dentin thickness  ( P>0.05  ) . The canal angle curvature  decreased in the two groups postoperatively . The systematic review identified six studies , and overall the two files performed similarly in the majority of categories examined . Therefore ,  the rotary NiTi Hero 642 and K3 files  demonstrated  comparable shaping abilities and maintenance of working length ."
"dABSTRACT R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) have demonstrated that  alpha lipoic acid ( ALA )  may change lipid profile , but their results are contradictory . The aim of this study is to conduct a meta‐ analysis to assess the effects of  ALA  on lipid  profile  . Electronic data bases including ISI web of science , Ovid , PubMed / Medline , SCOPUS , and Google Scholar were search ed up to February 2018 . RCTs which assessed  ALA  effects on lipid profile were selected .  Weighted mean difference ( WMD  ) and 95 %  confidence intervals (  CIs )  in serum lipids concentrations  were defined as intervention effects . R and om effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect . Heterogeneity was measured by using I2 test . The protocol was registered with PROSPERO ( No. CRD42017072365 ) . Data base search retrieved  12  articles .  Serum total cholesterol ( TC ) and low density lipoprotein‐cholesterol ( LDL‐ ) levels  were significantly lower in  subjects supplemented  with alpha‐lipoic acid   compared with  controls  ( WMD=−10.18mg/dL ; 95 % CI : −16.16 , −4.20mg/dL ; P=0.001 and WMD=−9.22mg/dL ; 95 % CI : −18.28 , −0.16mg/dL ; P=0.001 , respectively ) , but no significant changes were  found for high density lipoprotein‐cholesterol ( HDL‐c )  ( WMD : 3.02mg/dL ; 95 % CI : −0.39 , 6.43 ; P=0.082 ) .  The  overall   effect of ALA  on serum triglyceride  did not reveal any significant change , but in subgroup analysis based on health status ( diabetic vs. non‐diabetic )  ,  ALA  decreased serum triglyceride levels  in both diabetic and non‐diabetic groups compared with controls . This meta‐ analysis revealed  that ALA  might  favorably affect lipid profile especially LDL and TC  . However , for confirming these results , more studies particularly  among hyperlipidemic patients  are needed."
" The upper bound of the 95  % CI of ABT  for  cure  within two weeks without  major complications  crosses the 20 % margin of appendectomy , so the outcome is inconclusive . Also the quality of the studies was low to moderate , for that reason the results should be interpret with caution and definite conclusions can not be made . Therefore we conclude that  appendectomy  remains the st and ard treatment for acute appendicitis .  Antibiotic treatment  might be used as an alternative treatment in a good quality RCT or in specific patients or conditions were surgery is contraindicated."
"dBackground A scoping search identified systematic review s on diagnostic accuracy and predictive ability of  frailty measures in older adults .  In most cases , research was confined to specific assessment measures related to a specific clinical model . Objectives To summarize the best available evidence from systematic review s in relation to reliability , validity , diagnostic accuracy and predictive ability of frailty measures in  older adults .  Inclusion criteria Population  Older adults aged 60 years or older recruited from community , primary care , long-term residential care and hospitals .   Index test Available frailty measures in older  adults   . Reference test Cardiovascular Health Study phenotype model , the Canadian Study of Health and Aging cumulative deficit model , Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment or other reference tests . Diagnosis of interest Frailty defined as an age-related state of decreased physiological reserves characterized by an increased risk of poor clinical outcomes . Types of studies Quantitative systematic review s. Search strategy A three-step search strategy was utilized to find systematic  review  s ,  available in English  ,  published between January 2001 and October 2015 .  Method ological quality Assessed by two independent review ers using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for systematic review s and research synthesis . Data extraction Two independent review ers extracted data using the st and ardized data extraction tool design ed for umbrella review s. Data synthesis Data were only presented in a narrative form due to the heterogeneity of included review s. Results  Five review s with a total of 227,381 participants  were included in this umbrella review . Two review s focused on  reliability , validity and diagnostic accuracy ;  two examined  predictive ability  for adverse health outcomes ; and one investigated  validity , diagnostic accuracy and predictive ability  . In total , 26 question naires and brief assessment s and eight frailty indicators were analyzed , most of which were applied to  community-dwelling older people .  The  Frailty Index  was examined in almost all these dimensions , with the exception of  reliability  , and its diagnostic and predictive characteristics were shown to be satisfactory .  Gait speed  showed  high sensitivity  , but only  moderate specificity  , and  excellent predictive ability for future disability in activities of daily living .  The Tilburg  Frailty Indicator  was shown to be a reliable and valid measure for frailty screening , but its diagnostic accuracy was not evaluated . Screening Letter , Timed-up- and -go test and PRISMA 7 ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ) demonstrated  high sensitivity and moderate specificity  for identifying frailty . In general ,  low physical activity  , variously measured , was one of the most powerful predictors of future  decline in activities of daily living .  Conclusion Only a few frailty measures seem to be demonstrably  valid , reliable and diagnostically accurate  , and have good predictive ability . Among them , the  Frailty Index  and  gait speed  emerged as the most useful in routine care and community setting s. However , none of the included systematic review s provided responses that met all of our research questions on their own and there is a need for studies that could fill this gap , covering all these issues within the same study . Nevertheless , it was clear that no suitable tool for assessing  frailty  appropriately in emergency departments was identified."
"sOBJECTIVES Ageing in men is associated with a gradual decline in serum testosterone levels and a concomitant loss of muscle mass , accumulation of central adiposity , impaired mobility and increased risk of bone fractures . Whether and rogen treatment might be beneficial in these subjects is still under debate . We have carried out a systematic review of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the effects of  testosterone ( T ) administration   to middle-aged and ageing men  on body composition , muscle strength , bone density , markers of bone metabolism and serum lipid profile . DATA SOURCE A comprehensive search of all published r and omized clinical trials was performed using the MEDLINE , Cochrane Library , EMBASE and Current Contents data bases . REVIEW METHODS Guided by prespecified criteria , software-assisted data abstract ion and quality assessed by two independent review ers ,  29 RCTs  were found to be eligible . For each investigated variable , we reported the results of pooled estimates of  testosterone treatment  using the r and om effect model of meta- analysis . Heterogeneity , reproducibility and consistency of the findings across studies were explored using sensitivity and meta-regression analysis . RESULTS  Overall , 1,083 subjects were evaluated , 625 r and omized to T , 427 to  placebo  and 31 to observation ( control group ) . Weighted mean  age  was 64.5 years ( range 49.9 - -77.6 ) and mean  serum  testosterone   was 10.9 nmol/l ( range 7.8 - -19 ) .   Testosterone  treatment produced : ( i ) a  reduction  of 1.6 kg ( CI : 2.5 - -0.6 ) of  total body fat  , corresponding to -6.2 % ( CI : 9.2 - -3.3 ) variation of initial  body fat  , ( ii ) an increase in  fat free mass  of 1.6 kg ( CI : 0.6 - -2.6 ) , corresponding to + 2.7 % ( CI : 1.1 - -4.4 ) increase over baseline and ( iii ) no  change  in  body weight .  The effects of T on  muscle strength  were heterogeneous , showing a tendency towards improvement only at the leg/knee extension and h and grip of the dominant arm ( pooled effect size=0.3 st and ard mean difference ( SMD ) , CI : -0.0 to 0.6 ) .  Testosterone  improved  bone mineral density ( BMD ) at the lumbar spine  by + 3.7 % ( CI : 1.0 - -6.4 % ) compared to placebo , but not at the femoral neck , and produced a consistent reduction in  bone  resorption markers ( pooled effect size = -0.6 SMD , CI : -1.0 to -0.2 ) .  Testosterone  also  reduced total cholesterol  by 0.23 mmol/l ( CI : -0.37 to -0.10 ) , especially in men with lower baseline T concentrations , with no change in  low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol .  A significant reduction of  high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol  was found only in studies with higher mean T-values at baseline ( -0.085 mmol/l , CI : -0.017 to -0.003 ) . Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis revealed that the dose/type of T used , in particular the possibility of aromatization , explained the heterogeneity in findings observed on  bone density and HDL-cholesterol  among studies .  The present analysis provides an estimate of the average treatment effects of  testosterone therapy  in  middle-aged men .  Our findings are sufficiently strong to justify further interventional studies focused on alternative targets of and rogenic treatment carrying more stringent clinical implication s , in particular the cardiovascular , metabolic and neurological systems."
" This review found that  muscle strength , balance , and endurance  can be improved by  physical  activity  in people aged 40 - 65 years .  There were bigger effects on muscle strength from programs that used resistance exercises , indicating the need to include a resistance training component if strength enhancement is the goal."
"eBackground : There are few data regarding the effectiveness of  remote monitoring  for  older people with heart failure .  We conducted a post-hoc sub- analysis of a previously published large Cochrane systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant r and omized controlled trials to determine whether  structured telephone support and telemonitoring  were effective in this population . Methods : A post hoc sub- analysis of a systematic review and meta- analysis that applied the Cochrane methodology was conducted . Meta-analyses of  all-cause mortality , all-cause hospitalizations and heart failure-related hospitalizations  were performed for studies  where the mean or median age of participants was 70 or more years .  Results :  The mean or median age of participants was 70 or more years in eight of the 16 ( n=2659/5613 ; 47 % ) structured  telephone support  studies and four of the 11 ( n=894/2710 ; 33 % )  telemonitoring  studies .   Structured telephone support  ( RR 0.80 ; 95 % CI=0.63–1.00 ) and  telemonitoring  ( RR 0.56 ; 95 % CI=0.41–0.76 ) interventions  reduced mortality .   Structured telephone support interventions   reduced heart failure-related hospitalizations  ( RR 0.81 ; 95 % CI=0.67–0.99 ) . Conclusion : Despite a systematic bias towards recruitment of individuals younger than the epidemiological average into the r and omized controlled trials ,  older people with heart failure  did benefit from  structured telephone support and telemonitoring .  These post-hoc sub- analysis results were similar to overall effects observed in the main meta- analysis . While further research is required to confirm these observational findings , the evidence at h and indicates that discrimination by age alone may be not be appropriate when inviting participation in a remote monitoring service for heart failure."
"sBackground  Insulin resistance (  IR ) is a physiological condition related to type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and obesity , which is associated with high blood insulin and glucose .  Inulin-type carbohydrate ( ITC )  is a kind of fermentable fructan that can reduce glucose and ameliorate IR in an animal model , but the effect in clinical trials is controversial . Objective The authors conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the effect of  ITC supplementation  in ameliorating IR in  T2DM and obese patients .  Methods Multiple data bases were queried for studies  before December 25 , 2018  , which involved  supplementation  with  ITC  in ameliorating IR in T2DM  and obese patients .  Studies that involved meta- analysis of the  body mass index ( BMI )  ,  fasting plasma glucose ( FPG )  ,  fasting insulin ( FI )  ,  HbA1c  ,  homeostatic model assessment IR ( HOMA-IR )  , and  quantitative  insulin sensitivity  check index ( QUICKI  )  of T2DM subjects were included .   HOMA-IR  and  QUICKI  were identified as the primary outcomes . A systematic review was performed to evaluate the effect of  ITC  on IR in  obese patients .  Results The data base search  yielded 25 studies , which met the inclusion criteria ; 11 articles were meta-analyzed  , and  5 other articles on T2DM and 9 articles on simple obesity  were systematic ally review ed . Our results did not find  ITC supplementation  decrease postintervention and  reduction data of BMI  ( P = 0.08 ) . However , it can significantly decrease postintervention and reduction  data of FPG , FI , HbA1c , and HOMA-IR .  Heterogeneity was eliminated by subgroup analysis according to  baseline BMI  . There was no significant difference in the amelioration of  QUICKI  between the ITC and control groups . However , the difference was statistically significant and the heterogeneity was eliminated after subgroup analysis according to intakes of ITC . 14 articles for a systematic review found that the results of  blood glucose , insulin , and HbA1c  were controversial . Only one of the seven studies on simple obesity concluded that  ITC  intervention significantly  ameliorated HOMA-IR  , while the other six did not . Conclusion Supplementation  of ITC  can ameliorate IR in T2DM , especially in  obese T2DM patients  , but the effects are controversial in obese patients."
"sOral submucous fibrosis is a chronic , progressive scarring disease associated with both significant morbidity including  pain  and limited mouth  opening  and an increased risk for malignancy . This systematic review evaluated the different  medicinal ( i.e. nonsurgical ) interventions  available for the management of oral submucous fibrosis . An automated literature search es of online data bases from January  1960  to  December 2013  were performed and  only studies with high level of evidence based on the guidelines of the Oxford Centre for evidence -based medicine were selected . Thirteen studies ( 3 r and omized controlled trials and 10 clinical trials/controlled clinical trials )  were included and drugs  like steroids , hyaluronidase , human placenta extracts , chymotrypsin and collagenase , pentoxifylline , nylidrin hydrochloride , iron and multivitamin supplements including lycopene  were used . There is a clear lack of evidence on the available drug treatment for oral submucous fibrosis and further high quality r and omized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the different therapeutic agents."
"αWe conducted this systematic review and meta- analysis of  prospect i ve studies  to determine the effect of   probiotic administration  on  serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) concentrations  .  We search ed PubMed - Medline , Web of Science , the Cochrane , and Google Scholar data bases ( until May 2016  )  to identify  prospect  i  ve studies  evaluating the  impact of  probiotic administration  on CRP .  We used a r and om effects models and generic inverse variance methods to synthesize quantitative data , followed by a leave-one-out method for sensitivity analysis . The systematic review registration number was : CRD42016039457 .  From a total of 425 entries identified via search es , 20 studies were included in the final analysis .  The meta- analysis indicated a significant  reduction in serum CRP   following  probiotic administration with a weighted mean difference ( WMD ) of -1.35 mg/L , ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -2.15 to -0.55 , I² 65.1 % ) .  The WMDs for interleukin 10 ( IL10 )  was -1.65 pg/dL , ( 95 % CI -3.45 to 0.14 , I² 3.1 % ) , and -0.45 pg/mL , ( 95 % CI -1.38 to 0.48 , I² 10.2 % ) for tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) . These findings were robust in sensitivity analyses . This meta- analysis suggests  that  probiotic  administration  may  significantly reduce serum CRP  while having no significant effect  on  serum IL10 and TNF-α."
"sAccelerometers objective ly monitor  physical activity  and  sedentary patterns  and are increasingly used in the research setting . It is important to maintain consistency in data analysis and reporting , therefore , we : ( 1 ) systematic ally identified studies using  accelerometry  (  ActiGraph  , Pensacola , FL , USA ) to measure  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) and sedentary time  in  older  adults , and ( 2 ) based on the review findings , we used different cut-points obtained to analyze  accelerometry data  from a  sample of community-dwelling older women .  We identified  59 articles  with cut-points ranging between 574 and 3,250 counts/min for  MVPA  and 50 and 500 counts/min for  sedentary time .  Using these cut-points and data from  women ( mean age , 70 years )  , the  median MVPA minutes per day  ranged between 4 and 80 min while percentage of  sedentary time per  day ranged between 62 % and 86 % . These data highlight ( 1 ) the importance of reporting detailed information on the analysis assumptions and ( 2 ) that results can differ greatly depending on analysis parameters."
" Implication s for practice Increased knowledge of oral hypoglycaemic issues and reinforcement of the importance of medication adherence were useful in promoting adherence . Regular education sessions allow individuals to reinforce information and educators to identify barriers to medication adherence .  Educational interventions focusing  on  self-management strategies  appear more likely to achieve positive outcomes . Implication s for research Further trials involving larger sample s and population s with  poor glycaemic control  are needed . The effects of  educational interventions  , influence of additional take-home written material , the optimal interval length of follow-up and duration of education sessions , and specific processes of individual or group education which have been identified as effective need further exploration."
 Pain in IBD is significantly associated with cognitive and behavioural factors as well as low mood . This study contributes to a biopsychosocial underst and ing of pain in IBD and identifies important targets for future interventions.
"  Thiazides  when given as a second-line drug have a dose related effect to lower  blood pressure  that is similar to when they are added as a first-line drug . This means that the  BP lowering  effect of thiazides is additive .  Loop diuretics  appear to have a similar  blood pressure lowering effect  as thiazides at 1 times the recommended starting dose . Because of the short duration of the trials and lack of reporting of adverse events , this review does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of adverse effects of  diuretics  given as a second-line  drug ."
" Ultimately , the current evidence does not permit inference of a causal relationship between  vitamin D  deficiency and disease activity in MS .  Vitamin D supplementation  appears to be a promising treatment worthy of further exploration , but owing to the paucity of RCTs with placebo or comparator arms , the evidence is not definitive and appropriate dosing remains uncertain."
" This is the first systematic review of mediational psychological mechanisms of successful outcomes in obesity-related lifestyle change interventions . Despite limited evidence , higher  autonomous motivation , self-efficacy , and self-regulation skills  emerged as the best predictors of beneficial weight and physical activity outcomes ; for weight control , positive body image and flexible eating restraint may additionally improve outcomes . These variables represent possible targets for future lifestyle interventions in  overweight/obese population ."
"dPurpose To develop an evidence -based guideline for the management of  grade s I – III neck pain and associated disorders ( NAD ) .  Methods This guideline is based on recent systematic review s of high- quality studies . A multidisciplinary expert panel considered the evidence of effectiveness , safety , cost-effectiveness , societal and ethical values , and patient experiences ( obtained from qualitative research ) when formulating recommendations . Target audience includes  clinicians ; target population is adults with grade s I – III NAD < 6 months duration .  Recommendation 1Clinicians should rule out major structural or other pathologies as the cause of NAD . Once major pathology has been ruled out , clinicians should classify NAD as grade I , II , or III . Recommendation 2Clinicians should assess prognostic factors for  delayed recovery  from NAD . Recommendation 3Clinicians should educate and reassure patients about the benign and self-limited nature of the typical course of NAD grade s I – III and the importance of maintaining activity and movement . Patients with worsening symptoms and those who develop new physical or psychological symptoms should be referred to a physician for further evaluation at any time during their care . Recommendation 4For NAD grade s I – II ≤3 months duration , clinicians may consider  structured patient education in combination with : range of motion exercise , multimodal care ( range of motion exercise with manipulation or mobilization ) , or muscle relaxants .  In view of evidence of no effectiveness , clinicians should not offer  structured patient education  alone ,  strain-counterstrain therapy , relaxation massage , cervical collar , electroacupuncture , electrotherapy  , or  clinic-based heat  . Recommendation 5For NAD grade s I – II > 3 months duration , clinicians may consider  structured patient education in combination with : range of motion and strengthening exercises , qigong , yoga , multimodal care ( exercise with manipulation or mobilization ) , clinical massage , low-level laser therapy , or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs .  In view of evidence of no effectiveness , clinicians should not  offer strengthening exercises alone ,  strain-counterstrain therapy , relaxation massage , relaxation therapy  for pain or disability   , electrotherapy , shortwave diathermy  , clinic-based  heat , electroacupuncture  ,  or botulinum toxin injections  . Recommendation 6For NAD grade III ≤3 months duration , clinicians may  consider supervised strengthening exercises  in addition  to structured patient education .  In view of evidence of no effectiveness , clinicians should not offer  structured patient education alone  ,  cervical collar , low-level laser therapy  , or traction . Recommendation 7For NAD grade III > 3 months duration , clinicians should not offer a cervical collar .  Patients  who  continue to experience neurological signs and disability more than 3 months after injury  should be referred to a physician for investigation and management . Recommendation 8Clinicians should reassess the patient at every visit to determine if additional care is necessary , the condition is worsening , or the patient has recovered . Patients reporting significant recovery should be discharged."
" There are relatively few controlled trials of the  pharmacotherapy  of disruptive behavior disorders or other impulse control disorders , despite the importance of research in this area . Given the potential adverse effects of agents such as lithium and risperidone , a careful risk – benefit analysis is needed for each patient."
"sBACKGROUND Valid and reliable outcome measurements are a prerequisite for evidence -based practice . The comparative validity and reliability of outcome measurements for assessing  atopic eczema ( AE )  severity is unclear . OBJECTIVE We sought to assess the validity , reliability , sensitivity to change , and ease of use of outcome measurements for AE . We also sought to give recommendations on which outcomes to use in clinical research and for clinical monitoring . METHODS We performed a systematic review and survey of  clinical experts and patients .  RESULTS Twenty published outcome measurements were identified . There is evidence of adequate construct validity for 3 measurements (  Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index  [ SCORAD ] ,  Eczema Area and Severity Index  [ EASI ] , and Three Item  Severity  Score ) , adequate internal consistency of 1 scale ( Patient-oriented Eczema Measure [ POEM ] ) , adequate interobserver  reliability  of 5 measurements (  Basic Clinical Scoring System  ;  Nottingham Eczema Severity Score ; Objective Severity Assessment of Atopic Dermatitis ;  Six Area , Six Sign  Atopic Dermatitis severity score ;  and  SCORAD  ) , adequate  test-retest reliability  of 1 scale ( POEM ) , and adequate sensitivity to change of 3 measurements  ( EASI , SCORAD , and Investigators ' Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment )  . Most outcome measurements have adequate content validity , as assessed by patients and experts . Data on the  time to perform  the  assessment  was identified for 8 outcome measurements . Only  SCORAD , EASI  , and POEM have been tested sufficiently and performed adequately .  There are too many published outcome measures for AE . Most have not been tested properly or perform adequately when tested , and their continued use hampers scientific communication . CLINICAL IMPLICATION S Only SCORAD , EASI , and POEM currently perform adequately . These scales should be used in future studies."
"TINTRODUCTION  Root canal treatment ( RCT )  success criteria inform us of the path to bony healing and of prognostic factors , but tell little about how the patient perceives , feels , or values  RCT .  Patients choose , undergo , and pay for  RCT  , they live with the result , and inform their community . The purpose of this narrative review was to appraise patient-centered outcomes of  initial  non-surgical RCT  and  nonsurgical retreatment  , in adults .  MATERIAL S AND METHODS Patient-centered  RCT  outcome themes were identified in the extant literature :  quality of life , satisfaction , anxiety , fear , pain , tooth survival and cost .  Narrative review was applied because the disparate themes and data were unsuited to systematic review or meta- analysis . RESULTS Application of the Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP ) demonstrated that disease of pulpal origin affects  quality of life  with moderate severity , primarily through physical  pain  and psychological  discomfort  , and that  RCT  results in broad improvement of  quality of life . Satisfaction  with  RCT  is extremely high , but  cost  is the primary reason for dissatisfaction .  Anxiety and fear  affect RCT patients , profoundly influencing their behaviors , including treatment avoidance , and their pain experience .  Fear of pain  is "" fair "" to "" very much "" prior to RCT .  Pain  is widely feared , disliked , and remembered ; however , disease of pulpal origin generally produces moderate , but not severe  pain .   RCT  causes a dramatic decrease in  pain prevalence and severity  over the week following treatment .  Survival rates of teeth  after  RCT  are very high ; complication  rates  are low .  Cost  is a barrier to  RCT  , but  initial costs , lifetime costs , cost effectiveness , cost utility , and cost benefit  all compare extremely well to the alternatives involving replacement using implants or fixed prostheses .  Dentists must strive to reduce anxiety , fear , experienced and remembered pain , and to accurately inform and educate their patients with respect to technical , practical and psychosocial aspects of RCT."
"sObjective The aim of this meta- analysis of r and omized  placebo-controlled  trials was to examine whether  ursodeoxycholic acid  treatment is an  effective lipid-lowering agent  . Methods PubMed - Medline , SCOPUS , Web of Science and Google Scholar data bases were search ed in order to find r and omized controlled trials evaluating the effect of  ursodeoxycholic acid  on lipid profile . A r and om-effect model and the generic inverse variance weighting method were used for quantitative data synthesis . Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method . A r and om-effects meta-regression model was performed to explore the association between potential confounders and the estimated effect size  on plasma lipid concentrations  . Results Meta- analysis of 20 treatment arms revealed a significant  reduction of total cholesterol   following ursodeoxycholic acid  treatment ( WMD : − 13.85 mg/dL , 95 % CI : -21.45 , − 6.25 , p < 0.001  )  .  Nonetheless , LDL-C  ( WMD : -6.66 mg/dL , 95 % CI : -13.99 , 0.67 , p =  0.075 ) , triglycerides  ( WMD : − 1.42 mg/dL , 95 % CI : -7.51 , 4.67 , p =  0.648  )  and HDL-C  ( WMD : -0.18 mg/dL , 95 % CI : -5.23 , 4.87 , p = 0.944 ) were not found to be significantly altered  by ursodeoxycholic acid  administration . In the  subgroup of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis   , ursodeoxycholic acid   reduced total cholesterol  ( WMD : − 29.86 mg/dL , 95 % CI : -47.39 , − 12.33 , p =  0.001 ) and LDL-C  ( WMD : -37.27 mg/dL , 95 % CI : -54.16 , − 20.38 , p < 0.001 ) concentrations without  affecting TG and HDL-C.  Conclusion This meta- analysis suggests  that ursodeoxycholic acid  therapy might be associated  with significant total cholesterol lowering  particularly in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis."
"SThis study aim ed to systematic ally review r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) to clarify the effects of  pro-/synbiotic supplementation  on  anthropometric and biochemical measurements  in  women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) .  PubMed , Scopus , ISI Web of Science , Cochrane Library , and Google Scholar were search ed through September 2018 . Eight RCTs ( nine treatment arms ) were included .  Pro-/synbiotic supplementation  significantly  reduced fasting blood sugar  ( −2.52 mg/dl , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : −4.10 to −0.95 )  , insulin  ( −2.27 µIU/mL , 95 % CI : −3.40  to −1.14 ) , homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance  index ( −0.69 , 95 % CI : −0.98 to  −0.40 ) , C-reactive protein  ( −1.69 Hedges ’ , 95 % CI : −3.00 to −0.38  ) , and total testosterone  ( −0.12 ng/mL , 95 % CI : −0.17 to −0.08 ) in  women  with PCOS . However , changes  in the mean difference of weight and body mass index  did not reach a statistically significant level . The findings suggest  that pro-/synbiotic supplementation  may  improve glucose homeostasis parameters , hormonal , and inflammatory indices  in women with PCOS."

"nAtrial  fibrillation ( AF )  is a major public health problem in the  United States .  More than 2.3 million Americans are estimated to have  AF  ( 1 ) . The known association between AF and substantial  mortality , morbidity ,  and  health care costs  compounds the effect of this condition . Not only is the risk for  death  in  patients with AF  twice that of patients  without  it , but AF can result in myocardial  ischemia  and  infa  rct ion , exacerbate  heart failure ( HF )  , and cause  tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy  if the ventricular rate is not well-controlled ( 25 ) . The most dreaded complication of AF is  thromboembolism  , especially  stroke  ( 6 ) . In some patients , AF or therapies to manage this condition can severely depreciate quality of life ( 710 ) . Furthermore , the management of AF and its complications is responsible for nearly $ 16 billion in additional costs to the U.S. health care system per year ( 11 ) . Despite the substantial public health effect of AF , uncertainties around its management remain . In particular , the  comparative safety and effectiveness  of different  rate-  and rhythm-control  therapies  for patients with AF are unclear . We conducted this systematic review to evaluate the  comparative safety and effectiveness of rate- versus rhythm-control  strategies ;   medications used for ventricular rate  control ;  strict versus more lenient rate-control  strategies  ;  nonpharmacologic rate-control  therapies   versus  medications  ; electrical cardioversion and antiarrhythmic medications   for  restoration of sinus rhythm  ;   and   catheter ablation , surgical ablation  , and  antiarrhythmic medications   for maintenance of  sinus rhythm .  Methods We developed and followed a st and ard protocol for our review . Full details of our methods , search strategies , results , and conclusions are presented in a comparative effectiveness review commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) and are available at www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov ( 12 ) . Data Sources and Search es We search ed PubMed , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s for studies published between 1 January 2000  and 12  November 2013 . Data before 2000 have been summarized in an AHRQ report on the management of new-onset AF published in 2001 ( 1315 ) . Study Selection We identified r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) published in English that were comparative assessment s of  pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic rate- or rhythm-control therapies  aim ed at treating  adults  with AF . Observational studies were also allowed for comparisons of strict versus lenient rate control or  cardiac resynchronization therapy  versus other rhythm-control  therapies  . The following outcomes were considered :  restoration of sinus rhythm ( conversion ) , maintenance of sinus rhythm , recurrence of AF at 12 months , development of cardiomyopathy , death ( all-cause and cardiac ) , myocardial infa rct ion , cardiovascular hospitalizations , HF symptoms , control of AF symptoms , quality of life , functional status , stroke and other embolic events , bleeding events , and adverse effects of therapy .  Data Extraction and Quality Assessment One investigator abstract ed and another confirmed data related to study setting and design , patient characteristics , details of treatment , comparators , and relevant outcomes . The  quality  of individual studies was evaluated using the approach described in AHRQ 's Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Review s ( 16 ) . Investigators also assessed factors that limited applicability of the evidence . Data Synthesis and Analysis For each treatment comparison and outcome of interest , we determined the feasibility of completing a quantitative synthesis ( meta- analysis ) based on the volume of relevant literature , conceptual homogeneity of the studies ( both in terms of study population and outcomes ) , and completeness of the reporting of results . We considered meta- analysis for outcomes that at least 3 studies reported . For our evaluation of rate- versus rhythm-control strategies , we grouped all rate-control strategies together and all rhythm-control strategies together , regardless of the specific medication or procedure . We grouped pharmacologic  interventions  by class , considering  rate-controlling calcium-channel blockers  and  all -blockers  each to be similar enough to be grouped together . We categorized procedures into electrical  cardioversion ,  atrioventricular node ( AVN ) ablation , AF ablation by pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) ( by open surgical , minimally invasive , or transcatheter procedures ) , and different types of surgical maze procedures and explored comparisons among these categories . In addition , for the comparisons focusing on medications versus procedures , we also explored grouping all medications together and comparing them with all procedures . When a meta- analysis was appropriate , we used a r and om-effects model to synthesize the available evidence quantitatively using Comprehensive Meta- Analysis , version 2 ( Biostat , Englewood , New Jersey ) . We used a st and ardized approach to rank the overall strength of evidence ( SOE ) for each outcome ( 16 ) . Role of the Funding Source Primary funding was provided by AHRQ . Neither the technical experts nor AHRQ representatives had a role in the literature search , data analysis , interpretation of the data , or decision to su bmi t the manuscript for publication . Results  We screened 10495 abstract s , evaluated 570 full-text articles , and included 200 articles representing 162 studies involving  28836 patients ( Figure 1 ) . Tables 1 to 6 of the Supplement provide details about these studies and their population s for each topic described here . Table 7 of the Supplement lists identified and potential limitations of the studies . The full AHRQ report highlights additional findings ( 12 ) . Figure 1 . Summary of evidence search and selection .  AAD = antiarrhythmic drug ; CRT  =  cardiac resynchronization therapy ;  RCT = r and omized , controlled trial . * Some studies were relevant to more than 1 topic . Supplement . Tables Rate- Versus Rhythm-Control Strategies We included  16 RCTs in this analysis : 13 compared  pharmacologic rhythm-control versus rate-control strategies  ( 1729 ) and 3  compared a  rhythm-control strategy with PVI versus a rate-control strategy that involved AVN ablation and implantation of a pacemaker in 1 study  ( 30 ) and  rate-controlling medications in the other  2 ( 31 , 32 ) .  Ten RCTs ( 17 , 18 , 2022 , 2428 )  provided information on outcomes of interest and were combined quantitatively ( Figure 2 ) . Of these ,  5 included only patients with persistent AF ( 2022 , 25 , 28 ) , 1 included only patients with paroxysmal AF ( 17 ) , and 4 included patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF ( 18 ,  24 , 26 , 27  ) .  Two studies ( 17 , 22 ) compared a  single-chamber pacemaker plus AVN ablation versus  a  dual-chamber pacemaker plus AVN ablation plus an antiarrhythmic medication ;  all others compared largely unspecified rate-control with rhythm-control strategies . Figure 2 . Meta- analysis forest plots .  AAD  =  antiarrhythmic drug  ; PVI = pulmonary vein isolation . A.  All-cause mortality  for rate- vs. rhythm-control strategies . B.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm  for PVI vs. AAD therapy . Figure 2 . Continued . Data from the included studies showed moderate SOE that pharmacologic  rate- and rhythm-control strategies  are of comparable efficacy with regard to their effect on  all-cause mortality  ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.34 [ 95 % CI , 0.89 to 2.02 ] ; Q= 21.71 ; P= 0.003 ) ( Figure 2 , A ) ( 18 , 2022 , 24 , 2628 ) ,  cardiac mortality  ( OR , 0.96 [ CI , 0.77 to 1.20 ] ; Q= 3.55 ; P= 0.47 ) ( Figure 2 , B ) ( 18 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 25 ) , and  stroke  ( OR , 0.99 [ CI , 0.76 to 1.30 ] ; Q= 7.02 ; P= 0.43 ) ( Figure 2 , C ) ( 17 , 18 , 2022 , 24 , 27 , 28 ) . Although the meta- analysis for  all-cause mortality  showed a potential benefit , it did not reach statistical significance and 6 of the  8 studies ( 6069 patients  [ 95 % ] ) had ORs that crossed 1 , result ing in a final moderate SOE . For  cardiac mortality  ( Figure 2 , B ) , point estimates were inconsistent and CIs were wide for 2 of the 5 studies ( 18 , 21 ) , but there was no evidence of heterogeneity ; therefore , our SOE rating was not affected . For the outcome  of stroke  , there was no evidence of heterogeneity , but the findings were mostly driven by 1 large , good- quality RCT (  4060 patients )  , which was inconsistent with several of the smaller studies , reducing our confidence in the finding and in the SOE . These  studies largely included older patients with mild AF symptoms .  Three RCTs compared  pharmacologic rate-control strategies with rhythm-control strategies using antiarrhythmic medications  ( 17 , 18 , 22 ) . These RCTs showed fewer  cardiovascular hospitalizations  with the rhythm-control strategies ( 17 , 18 , 22 ) . Although data from 5 RCTs suggest that there is no difference between pharmacologic rate- and rhythm-control strategies in their effect on  HF symptoms  ( 17 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 46 ) ( Table 1 ) , a prespecified sub study of the Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure study showed that a higher  proportion  of time spent  in sinus rhythm  was associated with a greater improvement in  New York Heart Association class  ( 29 ) . Table 1 . Summary of SOE and Effect Estimates for Rate- Versus Rhythm-Control Strategies Three studies compared a  rhythm-control strategy involving catheter ablation with a rate-control strategy involving rate-controlling medications ( 32 ) or AVN ablation combined with implantation of a pacemaker ( 30 ) or rate-controlling medications  ( 31 ) . One study showed that  catheter  ablation was better than pharmacologic rate control at  improving symptoms , neurohormonal status , and objective physiologic exercise capacity  ( 32 ) . Another study showed that PVI isolation was superior to AVN ablation and pacemaker implantation in  improving quality of life , 6-minute walk distance ,  and  ejection fraction  ( 30 ) . Another study showed that PVI result ed in long-term restoration."
"sThis study systematic ally assessed the effectiveness of  lifestyle interventions  on  glycemic indicators  among  adults ( ⩾18years ) without IGT or diabetes .  R and omized controlled trials  using physical activity ( PA ) , diet ( D ) , or their combined strategies ( PA+D )  with follow-up ⩾12months were systematic ally search ed from multiple electronic- data bases between inception and May 4 , 2016 . Outcome measures  included fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , fasting insulin ( FI ) , homeostasis model assessment -estimated insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , and bodyweight  . Included studies were divided into  low-range ( FPG < 5.5mmol/L or HbA1c < 5.5 % ) and high-range ( FPG ⩾5.5mmol/L  or  HbA1c  ⩾5.5  %  ) groups according to baseline glycemic levels .  Seventy-nine studies met inclusion criteria .  R and om-effect models demonstrated that compared with usual care , lifestyle interventions achieved  significant reductions in  FPG ( -0.14mmol/L [ 95%CI , -0.19 , -0.10 ]  )  , HbA1c ( -0.06 % [ -0.09 , -0.03 ] ) , FI ( % change : -15.18 % [ -20.01 ,  -10.35 ] ) , HOMA-IR  ( % change : -22.82 % [ -29.14 , -16.51 ] )  , and bodyweight  ( % change : -3.99 % [ -4.69 , -3.29 ] ) . The same effect sizes  in  FPG reduction ( 0.07 ) appeared among both low-range and high-range groups . Similar effects were observed among all groups regardless of lengths of follow-up  . D and PA+D   interventions had larger effects on glucose reduction   than  PA  alone  . Lifestyle   interventions  significantly improved FPG , HbA1c , FI , HOMA-IR , and bodyweight  among  adults without IGT or diabetes  , and might reduce progression of hyperglycemia to type 2 diabetes mellitus."
"yBariatric  surgery  is currently the most effective treatment for  morbid obesity .  These procedures change the gastrointestinal system with the aim of reducing dietary intake . Improving diet quality is essential in maintaining nutritional health and achieving long-term benefits from the surgery . The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between  bariatric surgery  and  diet quality  at least 1 year after surgery . A systematic search of five data bases was conducted . Studies were included that reported  diet quality , eating pattern , or quality of eating  in  adult patients who had undergone  laparoscopic-adjusted gastric b and ing  ( LAGB ) ,  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  (  RYGB )  , and  sleeve gastrectomy  ( SG ) procedures .  Data was extracted to determine the relationship between having had  bariatric  surgery   and subsequent  diet quality .  A  total  of  34 study articles ( described in 36 articles )  met the inclusion criteria . The majority of studies were observational in nature and showed a  reduction in energy intake  following surgery , as well as inadequate  intakes of micronutrients and protein  , and an  excessive intake of fats .  There was evidence of  nutrient imbalances  , suboptimal compliance with multivitamin and mineral supplementation , and limited follow-up of patients . The current evidence base suggests that despite being effective in reducing  energy intake  ,  bariatric surgery  can result in unbalanced  diets  , inadequate  micronutrient and protein intakes  , and  excessive intakes of fats .  In combination with suboptimal adherence to multivitamin and mineral supplementation , this may contribute to  nutritional deficiencies and weight regain .  There is a need for high- quality nutrition studies , to identify optimal dietary compositions following bariatric surgery."
"nPurpose of review In the past decade ,  food  allergy has been increasingly recognized as an important public health issue . The role of  maternal and infant diet  in the development of food allergy has been a major focus of research throughout this period . Recently , research in this area has moved from observational studies to intervention trials , and the findings from these trials have started to influence infant feeding guidelines . In this article , we review recent studies of  dietary interventions  for preventing food allergy , summarize current knowledge and discuss future research directions . Recent findings The latest result from an intervention trial shows that introduction of  peanut  in the first year of life reduces the  risk of peanut allergy  in  high-risk infants  . A systematic review and meta- analysis of intervention trials also suggests a  protective effect  of egg introduction from around 4 to 6 months of age for reducing the  risk of egg allergy  , with most studies conducted in high-risk infants . Despite several intervention trials involving modifications to the maternal diet , the effect of maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation in preventing  food  allergy remains unclear . Summary Earlier introduction of allergenic foods is a promising intervention to reduce the  risk of some food allergies  in  high-risk infants  . Further work is needed to improve knowledge of how to prevent  food allergy  in the general population."
"yBackground An immediate loss of  strength  follows virtually all types of muscle injury but there is debate whether the initial strength loss is maximal or if a secondary loss of strength occurs during the first 3 days post-injury . Objective The objective of this analysis was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of the research literature to determine if a secondary loss of  strength  occurs after an injurious initiating event . Methods Literature search es were performed using eight electronic data bases ( e.g. , PubMed , Cochrane Library ) . Search terms included skeletal muscle AND ( injur * OR damage * ) AND ( strength OR force OR torque ) . The extracted strength data were converted to a st and ard format by calculating the st and ardized mean difference , which is reported as the effect size ( ES ) along with its 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . The calculation of ES was design ed so that a negative ES that was statistically less than zero would be interpreted as indicating a secondary loss of strength . Results  A total of 223 studies with over 4000 human and animal subjects yielded data on 262 independent groups and a  total of  936 separate ESs  . Our overall meta- analysis yielded a small-to-medium , positive overall ES that was statistically greater than zero ( overall ES = + 0.34 , 95 % CI 0.27–0.40 ; P < 0.00000001 ) . Considerable variation in ES was observed among studies ( I2 = 86 % ) , which could be partially explained by the research group conducting the study , sex of the subject , day of post-injury strength assessment , whether fatigue was present immediately post-injury , and the muscle group injured . From the subgroup meta-analyses probing these variables , 36 subgroup ESs were calculated and none were statistically less than zero . Conclusion Overall , our findings do not support the presence of a  secondary loss of strength  following an acute muscle injury , and strongly suggest that  strength  , on average , recovers steadily over the first 3 days post-injury."
"CA growing body of evidence suggests that the consumption of foods rich in polyphenolic compounds , particularly  cocoa  , may have  cardioprotective effects  . No review , however , has yet examined the effect of  flavonoid-rich cocoa ( FRC )  on all major cardiovascular risk factors or has examined potential dose-response relationships for these effects . A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized , controlled trials was performed to evaluate the effect of  FRC  on cardiovascular risk factors and to assess a dose-response relationship . Inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as dependent and independent variables were determined a priori . Data were collected for :  blood pressure , pulse , total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , TG , BMI , C-reactive protein , flow-mediated vascular dilation ( FMD ) , fasting glucose , fasting insulin , serum isoprostane , and insulin sensitivity/resistance indices .   Twenty-four papers , with 1106 participants , met the criteria for final analysis  . In response to  FRC  consumption ,  systolic blood pressure  decreased by 1.63 mm Hg ( P = 0.033 ) ,  LDL cholesterol  decreased by 0.077 mmol/L ( P = 0.038 ) , and  HDL cholesterol  increased by 0.046 mmol/L ( P = 0.037 ) , whereas  total cholesterol , TG , and C-reactive protein  remained the same . Moreover ,  insulin resistance  decreased ( HOMA-IR : -0.94 points ; P < 0.001 ) , whereas  FMD  increased ( 1.53 % ; P < 0.001 ) . A nonlinear dose-response relationship was found between  FRC  and FMD ( P = 0.004 ) , with maximum effect observed at a flavonoid dose of 500 mg/d ; a similar relationship may exist with  HDL cholesterol levels  ( P = 0.06 ) .  FRC  consumption significantly improves  blood pressure , insulin resistance , lipid profiles , and FMD .  These short-term benefits warrant larger long-term investigations into the cardioprotective role of FRC."
" Our study indicates that ADHD and sleep deprivation share a common neural signature :  hypoactivation of executive function neuroanatomy .  In contrast , sleep loss , but not ADHD , was associated with thalamic hyperactivations , intimating a potential compensatory response in sleep loss not present in ADHD . By elucidating shared and distinct patterns of functional neuroanatomy , these data provide novel targets for future experimental investigations of sleep loss in ADHD."
"sAims There are two techniques widely used to determine the rotational alignment of the components in  total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) ;   gap balancing ( GB )  and  measured resection ( MR ) .  Which technique is the best remains controversial . We aim ed to investigate this in a systematic review and meta‐ analysis . Material s and Methods In accordance with the methods of Cochrane , data bases were search ed for all  r and omised controlled trials in the literature between January 1986 and June 2015  comparing radiographic and clinical outcomes between the use of these two tecniques . Meta‐ analysis involved the use of the Revman5.3 software provided by Cochrane collaboration . Results  A total of 1464 papers were initially identified ,  and after the application of rigourous inclusion and exclusion critera ,  eight were included  in  the study .  In  total they inolved 980 TKAs .  The meta‐ analysis showed that  GB  techniques result ed in statistically significant  improvements  in  the restoration of mechanical and rotational alignment and mean Knee Society Scores and Knee Society Function scores  two years post‐operatively , but result ed in  greater elevation of the position of the joint  line . There is no significant difference in the  other  radiographic data . Conclusion This study suggests that GB may  provide better radiographic and clinical outcomes  than MR when used to determine mechanical rotation in TKAs."

"  Parent training  may have a positive effect on  the behaviour  of  children with ADHD .  It may also  reduce parental stress and enhance parental confidence .  However , the poor method ological quality of the included studies increases the risk of bias in the results . Data concerning ADHD-specific behaviour are ambiguous . For many important outcomes ,  including school achievement and adverse effects  , data are lacking . Evidence from this review is not strong enough to form a basis for clinical practice guidelines . Future research should ensure better reporting of the study procedures and results."

"sOBJECTIVE To determine the proportion of  people with hip and knee osteoarthritis  that meet physical activity guidelines recommended for  adults and older adults .  METHOD Systematic review with meta- analysis of studies measuring  physical activity  of  participants with hip and knee osteoarthritis using an  activity monitor .    Physical activity levels  were calculated using the mean average [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ] weighted according to sample size . Meta-analyses determined the proportion of people meeting  physical  activity guidelines and recommendations of ( 1 )  ≥150 min per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA )  in bouts of ≥10 min ; ( 2 ) ≥150  min per week of MVPA  in absence of bouts ; ( 3 ) ≥10,000 steps per day and ≥7000  steps  per day . The Grade s of Research , Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach was used to determine the quality of the evidence . RESULTS For  knee osteoarthritis  ,  21 studies involving 3266 participants  averaged 50 min per week ( 95 %  CI  = 46 ,  55 ) of MVPA  when measured in bouts of ≥10 min , 131 min per week ( 95 % CI = 125 , 137 ) of MVPA , and 7753 daily steps ( 95 % CI = 7582 , 7924 ) . Proportion meta-analyses provided high quality evidence that 13 % ( 95 % CI = 7 , 20 ) completed  ≥150  min per week  of MVPA  in bouts of ≥10 min , low quality evidence that 41 % ( 95 % CI = 23 , 61 ) completed ≥150 min per week  of MVPA  in absence of bouts , moderate quality evidence that 19 % ( 95 % CI = 8 , 33 ) completed ≥10,000 steps per day , and low quality evidence that 48 % ( 95 % CI = 31 , 65 ) completed ≥7000 steps per day . For hip osteoarthritis , 11 studies involving 325 participants averaged 160 min per week ( 95 %  CI = 114 , 216 ) of MVPA  when measured in bouts of ≥10 min , 189 min per week ( 95 % CI = 166 , 212 ) of MVPA , and 8174 daily steps ( 95 % CI = 7670 , 8678 ) . Proportion meta-analyses provided low quality evidence that 58 % ( 95 % CI = 18 , 92 ) completed ≥150 min per week  of MVPA  in absence of bouts , low quality evidence that 30 % ( 95 % CI = 13 , 50 ) completed ≥10,000 steps per day , and low quality evidence that 60 % ( 95 % CI = 47 , 73 ) completed ≥7000 steps per day .  A small to moderate proportion of  people with knee and hip osteoarthritis  met physical activity guidelines and recommended daily steps . Future research should establish the effects of increasing physical activity in this population to meet the current physical activity guidelines."
"nBACKGROUND Low levels of  25-OH vitamin D  are associated with   respiratory tract infection ( RTI )  .  However , results from r and omized controlled trials are inconclusive . Therefore , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to assess the preventive effect of  vitamin D supplementation  on RTI  .  METHODS R and omized , controlled trials of   vitamin  D  for prevention  of  RTI   were used for the analysis . The risks of within-trial and publication bias were assessed .  Odds ratios of RTI  were pooled using a r and om-effects model . Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran 's Q and I(2 ) . Meta-regressions and subgroup analyses were used to assess the influence of various factors on trial outcome . The pre-defined review protocol was registered at the PROSPERO international prospect i ve register of systematic review s , registration number CRD42013003530 . FINDINGS Of  1137 citations retrieved , 11  placebo-controlled  studies of 5660 patients were included in the meta- analysis .  Overall ,  vitamin D  showed a  protective effect against RTI  ( OR , 0.64 ; 95 % CI , 0.49 to 0.84 ) . There was significant heterogeneity among studies ( Cohran 's Q p<0.0001 , I(2 ) = 72 % ) . The  protective effect  was larger in studies using once-daily dosing compared to bolus doses ( OR = 0.51 vs OR = 0.86 , p = 0.01 ) . There was some evidence that results may have been influenced by publication bias . INTERPRETATION Results indicate that  vitamin D  has a  protective effect against RTI  , and dosing once-daily seems most effective . Due to heterogeneity of included studies and possible publication bias in the field , these results should be interpreted with caution."
"iPURPOSE To provide evidence -based recommendations to oncologists and others on  potentially curative therapy  for  patients with localized pancreatic cancer .  METHODS ASCO convened a panel of medical oncology , radiation oncology , surgical oncology , palliative care , and advocacy experts and conducted a systematic review of literature from January 2002 to June 2015 . Outcomes included  overall survival , disease-free survival , progression-free survival , and adverse events .  RESULTS  Nine r and omized controlled trials  met the systematic review criteria . RECOMMENDATIONS A  multiphase computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis or magnetic resonance imaging  should be performed for all  patients  to assess the anatomic relationships of the primary tumor and for the presence of intra-abdominal metastases . Baseline performance status , comorbidity profile , and goals of care should be evaluated and established .  Primary surgical resection  is recommended for all patients who have  no metastases  ,  appropriate performance and comorbidity profiles  , and no radiographic interface between primary tumor and mesenteric vasculature .  Preoperative therapy  is recommended for patients who meet specific characteristics .  All patients with resected pancreatic cancer who did not receive preoperative therapy  should be offered 6 months of  adjuvant chemotherapy  in the absence of contraindications .  Adjuvant chemoradiation  may be offered to patients who did not receive preoperative therapy with microscopically positive margins ( R1 ) after resection and /or who had node-positive disease after completion of 4 to 6 months of  systemic adjuvant chemotherapy .  Patients should have a full assessment of  symptoms , psychological status , and social supports  and should receive palliative care early . Patients who have completed treatment and have no evidence of disease should be monitored . Additional information is available at www.asco.org/ guidelines /PCPC and www.asco.org/ guidelines wiki."
" No  superiority  of  bevelled restorations  was observed in the short-term follow-up of 1-year , although this conclusion was based on only two RCTs . There is not enough evidence to support the  bevelled technique  over  non-bevelled  for NCCLs over longer periods of time . Better st and ardization and reporting of RCTs of  enamel bevelling  are necessary in longer-term follow-ups . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The literature still lacks a body of evidence to support the benefits of  enamel bevel over non-bevelled  for longer-term follow-ups , and future r and omised clinical trials with low risk of bias should be conducted."
"sResearch into the basic effects and therapeutic applications of   psychedelic drugs   has grown considerably in recent years . Yet , pressing questions remain regarding the substances ' lasting  effects .  Although individual studies have begun monitoring sustained changes , no study to- date has synthesized this information . Therefore , this systematic review aims to fill this important gap in the literature by synthesizing results from  34 contemporary experimental studies which included classic  psychedelics  , human subjects , and follow-up latencies of at least two weeks .  The bulk of this work was published in the last five years , with  psilocybin  being the most frequently administered drug . Enduring changes in  personality/attitudes , depression , spirituality , anxiety , wellbeing , substance misuse , meditative practice s , and mindfulness  were documented .  Mystical experiences , connectedness , emotional breakthrough , and increased neural entropy  were related to these long-term changes in psychological functioning . Finally , with proper screening , preparation , supervision , and integration ,  limited aversive side effects  were noted by study participants . Future research ers should focus on including larger and more diverse sample s , lengthier longitudinal design s , stronger control conditions , and st and ardized dosages."

"sSurgical  resection  remains the best treatment option for  patients with early stage of non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .  However , it may be responsible of  postoperative complication and mortality  , especially in  patients with impaired pulmonary function .  Enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) programs have been focused mainly in minimal invasive surgery approach during lung resection and respiratory rehabilitation after surgery .  Preoperative exercise-based intervention ( prehabilitation )  has demonstrated reduction of morbi-mortality in other surgeries but in thoracic surgery continues to be under discussion .   Cardio-pulmonary exercise test  ( CPET  ) is the gold st and ard technique to predict postoperative morbi-mortality . The implementation of a preoperative  respiratory rehabilitation  could optimize patient 's physical capacity before surgery and improve outcomes and enhance recovery . The aim of this systematic review of the literature is to identify the  effectiveness and safety  of  prehabilitation programs  in thoracic surgery , the type of exercise and its duration , and the group of patients with best benefit .  Prehabilitation  is a safe intervention without side effects in patients . High-intensity interval training ( HIT ) with duration of 2 to 6 weeks seems to be the best exercise programme in a prehabilitation intervention but it exists heterogeneity in terms of intensity and duration . Prehabilitation increase  exercise capacity  and  significantly enhances pulmonary function .  But the reduction of  postoperative complication and mortality  has not been clearly demonstrated . Different criteria selection , type of intervention and small sample size , in addition to no r and omization , could justify disparate results . It seems that not all patients can benefit from  prehabilitation  and it could be indicated only in patients with impaired lung function . Further r and omized clinical trials with enough patients , correct duration of HIT ( 2 to 6 weeks ) and focused in  COPD patients  are needed to clarify the suitability of prehabilitation . Meanwhile ,  safety  of  prehabilitation  and good results of some studies support this intervention in high-risk patients."
"dThis study aim ed to summarize earlier studies on the effects of   RS  consumption  on  the serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers .  A comprehensive search was done in the electronic data bases that published from 1988 up to May 2019 . Two review ers independently performed screening , data extraction , and risk-of-bias assessment . We used from the effect size , as estimated by the mean difference to perform the fixed method meta- analysis . Overall ,  13 studies with 14 effect sizes met the inclusion criteria  and  were included  in the final analysis .  Sample size of these studies ranged from 15 to 75 and intervention duration ranged from 4 to 14 weeks .  Meta- analysis revealed that higher consumption of  resistant  starch caused a significant  reduction  in  the interleukin 6  ( weighted mean difference = − 1.11 pg/mL ; 95 % CI : − 1.72 , − 0.5 pg/mL ; P = < 0.001 )  and tumor necrosis factor alpha  ( weighted mean difference = − 2.19 pg/mL ; 95 % CI : − 3.49 , − 0.9 pg/mL ; P = 0.001 ) levels . However , no significant changes were  found in C-reactive protein concentration  ( weighted mean difference = − 0.21 mg/L ; 95 % CI : − 1.06 , 0.63 mg/L ; P = 0.61 ) . Moreover ,  the changes in interleukin 6 concentration  was dependent on study quality and intervention duration . The current meta- analysis indicated  that RS  intake  can improve some inflammatory biomarkers .  More research , with a large sample sizes and accurate design is recommended."

"aSTUDY DESIGN Systematic review . OBJECTIVES The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate  intra- and interrater reliability  research of  physical examination tests  used for the assessment of  scapular dyskinesis .  BACKGROUND  Scapular dyskinesis  , defined as alteration of normal scapular kinematics , is described as a non-specific response to different shoulder pathologies . METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in  MEDLINE , EMBASE , AMED and PEDro until March 20th , 2015 .  Method ological  quality  was assessed with the  Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies ( QAREL )  by two independent review ers . RESULTS The search strategy revealed  3259 articles , of which 15 met the inclusion criteria .  These studies evaluated the  reliability  of 41 test and test variations used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis .  This review identified a lack of high- quality studies evaluating  intra- as well as interrater reliability  of tests used for the assessment of scapular dyskinesis . In addition ,  reliability measures  differed between included studies hindering proper cross- study comparisons . The  effect  of manual correction of the scapula on  shoulder symptoms  was evaluated in only one study , which is striking , since  symptom alteration tests  are used in routine care to guide further treatment . Thus , there is a strong need for further research in this area . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnosis , level 3a."
"sThis report presents the results of a systematic review of the effectiveness of   worksite nutrition and physical activity programs   to  promote healthy weight among employees .  These results form the basis for the recommendation by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services on the use of these interventions .  Weight-related outcomes  ,  including weight in pounds or kilograms , BMI , and percentage body fat  were used to assess effectiveness of these programs . This review found that  worksite nutrition and physical activity programs  achieve modest improvements in  employee weight status  at the 6 - 12-month follow-up . A pooled effect estimate of -2.8 pounds ( 95 % CI=-4.6 , -1.0 ) was found based on nine RCTs , and a decrease in  BMI  of -0.5 ( 95 % CI=-0.8 , -0.2 ) was found based on six RCTs . The findings appear to be applicable to  both male and female employees  , across a range of worksite setting s. Most of the studies combined  informational and behavioral strategies  to influence  diet  and  physical activity ;  fewer studies modified the work environment ( e.g. , cafeteria , exercise facilities ) to promote healthy choices . Information about other effects , barriers to implementation , cost  and  cost  effectiveness  of interventions , and research gaps are also presented in this article . The findings of this systematic review can help inform decisions of employers , planners , research ers , and other public health decision makers."
"dAbstract The aim of the study was to assess the effect of timing of  preoperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis ( SAP )  on   surgical site infection ( SSI )   and compare the different timing intervals . The benefit of routine use of  SAP  prior to surgery has long been recognized . However , the optimal timing has not been defined . For the purpose of developing recommendations for the World Health Organization guideline for  SSI  prevention , a systematic review and meta- analysis of all relevant evidence was conducted . Major medical data bases were search ed  from 1990 to 2016 .  The primary outcome was  SSI  after preoperative-SAP comparing different timing intervals .  Adjusted odds ratios ( OR )  with  95 % confidence intervals ( CI )  were extracted and pooled for each comparison with a r and om effects model .  Fourteen papers with 54,552 patients were included in this review .  In a quantitative analysis , there was no significant difference when  SAP  was administered 120–60 minutes prior to incision compared to administration 60–0 minutes prior to incision . Studies investigating different timing intervals within the last 60 minutes time frame reported contradictive results .  The risk of SSI  almost doubled when  SAP  was administered after first incision ( OR:1.89 ; 95%CI:[1.05–3.40 ] ) and was 5 times higher when administered more than 120 minutes prior to incision ( OR5.26 ; 95%CI:[3.29–8.39 ] ) . Administration  of antibiotic prophylaxis  more than 120 minutes before incision or after incision is associated a  higher risk of surgical site infections  than administration less than 120 minutes before incision . Within this 120-minute time frame prior to incision , no differential effects could be identified . The broadly accepted recommendation to administer prophylaxis within a 60-minute time frame prior to incision could not be substantiated."
"eOBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the evidence of the use of  incentive spirometry ( IS )  for the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications and for the recovery of pulmonary  function  in  patients undergoing abdominal , cardiac and thoracic surgeries .  METHODS Search es were performed in the following data bases : Medline , Embase , Web of Science , PEDro and Scopus to select r and omized controlled trials which the  IS  was used in pre- and /or post-operative in order to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications and /or recover lung function after abdominal , cardiac and thoracic surgery . Two review ers independently assessed all studies . In addition , the studies quality was assessed using the PEDro scale . RESULTS  Thirty studies were included ( 14 abdominal , 13 cardiac and 3 thoracic surgery ; n=3,370 patients ) .  In the analysis of the method ological quality , studies achieved a  PEDro average score  of 5.6 , 4.7 and 4.8 points in abdominal , cardiac and thoracic surgeries , respectively . Five studies ( 3 abdominal , 1 cardiac and 1 thoracic surgery ) compared the  effect of the  IS   with  control group  ( no intervention ) and no difference was detected in the  evaluated outcomes .   There was no evidence to support the use of  incentive spirometry  in the management of  surgical patients .  Despite this , the use of  incentive spirometry  remains widely used without st and ardization in clinical practice."
"2Objective To compare the effects of  moderate intensity continuous training ( MICT ) and high intensity interval training ( HIIT )  on   adult lipid profiles ;   to identify training or participant characteristics that may determine exercise-induced  change in total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglycerides ( TRG ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) .  Design Systematic review and meta- analysis . Data sources English language search es of several data bases were conducted from inception until September 2019 . Eligibility criteria for excluding studies Inclusion :  ( 1 ) published r and omised controlled human trials with group population n≥5 ; ( 2 ) intervention duration ≥4 weeks ; ( 3 ) comparing   HIIT with MICT  ;  and ( 4 ) reporting pre – post intervention lipid measurements . Exclusion : subjects with chronic disease , < 18 years , pregnant/lactating , in elite athletic training ; and studies with a dietary or pharmaceutical intervention component .  Results  Twenty-nine data sets ( mmol/L ) of 823 participants were pooled  and  analysed  .  Neither HIIT nor MICT  was better in  decreasing TC  ( 0.10 ( −0.06 to 0.19 ) , p=0.12 , I2=0 %  ) , TRG  ( −0.05 ( −0.11 to 0.01 ) , p=0.10 , I2=0  % ) , LDL-C  ( 0.05 ( −0.06 to 0.17 ) , p=0.37 , I2=0  % ) , or TC/HDL-C  ( −0.03 ( −0.36 to 0.29 ) , p=0.85 , I2=0  % ) .  HIIT  significantly raised HDL-C  ( 0.07 ( 0.04 to 0.11 ) , p<0.0001 , I2=0 % ) compared  with MICT  . Conclusion  Neither HIIT  nor  MICT  is  superior for altering TC , TRG , or LDL-C , or TC-HDL-C ratio  .  Compared with MICT , HIIT  appeared to  significantly improve HDL-C.  Clinicians may prescribe either protocol to encourage  participation  in exercise and  reduce cardiovascular risk  . To  raise  HDL-C  ,  HIIT may result in a larger effect size  compared with MICT  . PROSPERO registration number CRD42019136722."

"rBackground : The effect of  soy products  on the  weight of  overweight  or obese  people   is controversial , so we aim ed to conduct a systematic review and a meta- analysis of published r and omized controlled trials to analyze whether supplementation with  soy products  can help them to  lose weight .  Methods : The relevant data before January 2019 in PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Library were search ed . A r and om-effect model was adopted to calculate the weighted average difference of net changes  of body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , body fat percentage , fat mass , waist circumference , etc .  Results :  A total of 22 trials ( 870 overweight or obese participants ) were reflected  in the present meta-  analysis  . Analysis showed that  soy products  significantly  reduced body weight , BMI , body fat percent and waist circumference  in  overweight or obese Asian population  s ( −0.37 kg , P = 0.010 ; −0.27 kg/m2 , P = 0.042 ; −0.36 % , P = 0.032 ; −0.35 cm , P = 0.049 ) and more significant effects were observed in non-menopausal women  reduced body weight  ( −0.59 kg , P = 0.041 ) , BMI ( −0.59 , P = 0.041 )  and waist circumference  ( −0.59 cm , P = 0.041 ) in overweight or obese population s. Conclusion : This meta- analysis showed  that soy products   have weight loss effects  , mainly due to soy protein , isoflavone and soy fiber."

"eR and omised trials reported up to Dec 31 , 2012 , did not confirm that  vitamin D supplementation  could protect from non-skeletal  health  conditions  affecting adults  , as was expected on the basis of data from observational studies . To examine whether the more recently published meta-analyses and trials would change past conclusions , we systematic ally review ed  meta-analyses of  vitamin D supplementation  and non-skeletal disorders published between Jan 1 , 2013 , and May 31 , 2017 , that included study participants of all ages , including pregnant women .  We also search ed for r and omised trials not included in meta-analyses . We identified  87 meta-analyses , of which 52 were excluded because they contained less recent literature or were of suboptimal quality .  We retrieved  202 articles on trials that were not included in meta-analyses .  Recent meta-analyses reinforce the finding that 10 - 20 μg per day of  vitamin D  can reduce all-cause  mortality and cancer mortality  in  middle-aged and older people  . Although  vitamin  D doses were greater than those assessed in the past , we found no new evidence that supplementation could have an effect on most non-skeletal conditions , including cardiovascular disease , adiposity , glucose metabolism , mood disorders , muscular function , tuberculosis , and colorectal adenomas , or on maternal and perinatal conditions . New data on  cancer outcomes  were scarce . The compilation of results from 83 trials showed  that vitamin D supplementation  had no significant effect  on biomarkers of systemic inflammation  . The main new finding highlighted by this systematic review is  that vitamin D supplementation  might help to  prevent common upper respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations .  There remains little evidence to suggest  that vitamin D supplementation  has an effect on most conditions , including  chronic  inflammation , despite use of increased doses of vitamin D , strengthening the hypothesis that low vitamin D status is a consequence of ill health , rather than its cause . We further hypothesise  that vitamin D supplementation  could exert  immunomodulatory effects  that strengthen resistance to acute infections , which would reduce  the risk of death  in debilitated individuals . We identified many meta-analyses of suboptimal quality , which is of concern . Future systematic review s on  vitamin D  should be based on data sharing so that data for participants with the same outcomes measured in the same way can be pooled to generate stronger evidence."

"lAIM To identify factors that promote a positive start to school for  children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .  METHODS Web of Science , MEDLINE , Scopus , and PsychINFO search es were conducted to identify  literature published after 1991 and  relevant to  school  transition processes in  children with ASD . Twenty studies were deemed eligible for inclusion .  These studies evaluated a range of factors including  school readiness , parent and teacher perspectives on transition practice s  ,  characteristics of  children with  ASD  that are associated with successful transition  to  school and the  impact of  school based intervention   programs  .  RESULTS A review of these studies showed that  children  with  ASD  are less  school ready emotionally  than their peers and those children with ASD appear to have more  externalising behaviours and self-regulation difficulties  that affect their school engagement and their relationships with their teachers . There was a paucity of research looking at interventions targeting school readiness . However ,  school-based behavioural interventions  appear to improve  cognitive , language and daily living skills  , but have less impact on  socialisation and peer inclusion .    Children with ASD  face more challenges transitioning to school , particularly with  social interaction .  Further development and implementation of specific  school-based interventions  is needed in order to assist  children with autism  to maximise their success in starting school."

"rAbstract Background Prevalence of  atrial fibrillation  ( AF ) in  patients with congenital heart disease ( CHD )  is on the rise .  Anti-arrhythmic  drugs are usually the first line of treatment in CHD , however , it is often ineffective and poorly tolerated . We aim ed to perform a systematic review to assess the  efficacy and safety  of  catheter ablation for AF  in CHD . Methods We performed a comprehensive search on  catheter ablation for   atrial  fibrillation  in congenital heart disease up until July 2019  through several  electronic  data bases . Results  Ablation of AF  in  patients with CHD  had a modest 12 months  AF freedom  ranging from 32.8 % to 63 % , which can be increased by subsequent/repeat ablation . The complexity of CHD appears to have a significant effect on a study but not in others .  Catheter ablation  in ASD and persistent left superior vena cava had a high  success rate .  Overall ,  catheter ablation  is  safe  whichever the type of CHD is . Conclusion  Catheter ablation for AF  in CHD had modest  efficacy  that can be increased by subsequent/repeat ablation and it also has an excellent  safety profile .  Ablation in complex CHD could also have similar  efficacy  , however , it is preferably done by experts in a high volume tertiary center."
"  Recombinant human growth hormone ( hGH )  doses between 0.3 to 0.375 mg/kg/wk increase  short-term  growth  in girls with Turner syndrome  by approximately three ( two ) cm in the first ( second ) year of treatment . Treatment in one trial increased  final height  by approximately six cm over an untreated control group . Despite this increase , the  final height  of treated women was still outside the normal range . Additional trials of the effects of  hGH  carried out with control groups until final height is achieved would allow better informed decisions about whether the benefits of  hGH  treatment outweigh the requirement of treatment over several years at considerable cost."
"sBackground  Atypical antipsychotics  are increasingly used for treatment of  mental illnesses  like  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  , and considered to have fewer extrapyramidal effects than older antipsychotics . Methods We examined  efficacy  in  r and omised trials of bipolar disorder where the presenting episode was either depression , or manic/mixed  , comparing  atypical antipsychotic with placebo or active comparator  , examined withdrawals for any cause , or due to lack of efficacy or adverse events , and combined all phases for adverse event analysis . Studies were found through systematic search ( PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library ) , and data combined for analysis where there was clinical homogeneity , with especial reference to trial duration . Results  In five trials ( 2,206 patients ) participants presented with a depressive episode  , and  in 25 trials ( 6,174 patients )  the presenting  episode was manic or mixed .  In 8-week studies presenting with depression ,  quetiapine and olanzapine  produced significantly  better rates of response and symptomatic remission  than  placebo  , with NNTs of 5–6 , but more  adverse event withdrawals  ( NNH 12 ) . With mania or mixed presentation atypical antipsychotics produced significantly better  rates of response and symptomatic remission  than placebo , with NNTs of about 5 up to six weeks , and 4 at 6–12 weeks , but more  adverse event withdrawals  ( NNH of about 22 ) in studies of 6–12 weeks . In comparisons with established treatments , atypical antipsychotics had  similar efficacy  ,  but  significantly  fewer adverse event withdrawals  ( NNT to prevent one withdrawal about 10 ) . In maintenance trials atypical antipsychotics had significantly  fewer relapses to depression or mania  than placebo or active comparator . In placebo-controlled trials , atypical antipsychotics were associated with  higher rates of weight  gain of ≥7 % ( mainly olanzapine trials ) , somnolence , and extrapyramidal symptoms . In active controlled trials , atypical antipsychotics were associated with  lower rates of extrapyramidal symptoms  , but  higher rates of weight gain and somnolence  . Conclusion Atypical antipsychotics are effective in treating both phases of bipolar disorder compared with placebo , and as effective as established drug therapies . Atypical antipsychotics produce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms , but  weight gain  is more common ( with olanzapine ) . There is insufficient data confidently to distinguish between different atypical antipsychotics."
"dQUESTIONS In  female patients with locally advanced breast cancer ( labc ) and good response to  neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( nact )  , including  endocrine therapy   , what is the role of  breast-conserving surgery ( bcs )  compared with  mastectomy?In   female patients with labc  , is  radiotherapy  ( rt ) indicated for those who have undergone mastectomy?does locoregional rt , compared with breast or chest wall rt alone , result in a higher  survival rate  and  lower recurrence rates?is  rt indicated for those achieving a pathologic complete response ( pcr ) to nact?In  female patients with labc who receive nact  , is the most appropriate axillary staging procedure sentinel lymph node  biopsy  ( slnb ) or axillary dissection ? Is slnb indicated before nact rather than at the time of surgery?How should  female patients with labc  that does not respond to initial nact be treated ? METHODS This guideline was developed by Cancer Care Ontario 's Program in Evidence -Based Care ( pebc ) and the Breast Cancer Disease Site Group ( dsg ) . A systematic review was prepared based on literature search es conducted using the medline and embase data bases for the period 1996 to December 11 , 2013 . Guidelines were located from that search and from the Web sites of major guideline organizations . The working group drafted recommendations based on the systemic review . The systematic review and recommendations were then circulated to the Breast Cancer dsg and the pebc Report Approval Panel for internal review ; the revised document underwent external review . The full three-part evidence series can be found on the Cancer Care Ontario Web site . RECOMMENDATIONS For most  patients with labc  , modified radical mastectomy should be considered the st and ard of care . For some  patients with noninflammatory labc  , bcs can be considered on a case-by-case basis when the surgeon deems that the disease can be fully resected and the patient expresses a strong preference for breast preservation . For patients with labc , rt after  mastectomy  is recommended . It is recommended that , after bcs or mastectomy , patients with labc receive locoregional rt encompassing the breast or chest wall and local node-bearing areas .It is recommended that postoperative rt remain the st and ard of care for patients with labc who achieve pcr to nact . It is recommended that axillary dissection remain the st and ard of care for axillary staging in labc , with the judicious use of slnb in patients who are advised of the limitations of the current data .Although slnb either before or after nact is technically feasible , the data are insufficient to make any recommendation about the optimal timing of slnb with respect to  nact .  Limited data suggest higher  sentinel lymph node identification rates  and lower  false negative identification rates  when slnb is conducted before  nact ;  however , those data must be balanced against the requirement for two operations if slnb is not performed at the time of resection of the main tumour . It is recommended that  patients receiving  neoadjuvant anthracycline-taxane-based therapy  ( or other sequential  regimens  )  whose tumours do not respond to the initial agent or agents , or who experience disease progression , be expedited to the next agent or agents of the regimen . For patients who , in the opinion of the treating physician , fail to respond or progress on first-line  nact  , several therapeutic options can be considered , including  second-line chemotherapy , hormonal therapy  ( if appropriate ) , rt , or  immediate surgery  ( if technically feasible ) . Treatment should be individualized through discussion at a multidisciplinary case conference , considering  tumour characteristics , patient factors and preferences , and risk of adverse effects .  It is recommended that prospect i ve r and omized clinical trials be design ed for  patients with labc  who fail  to respond to  nact   so that more definitive treatment recommendations can be developed."
"sBackground Research suggests that  individuals with musculoskeletal injury  may have difficulty negotiating physical tasks when they are combined with cognitive loads . Objective Our objective was to conduct a systematic review to underst and the effects of increased cognitive dem and on movement patterns among  individuals with musculoskeletal injuries .  Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed , MEDLINE , the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) , and SPORTD iscus was conducted to find research reports that included  a population that had previously experienced an ankle , knee , or low back injury , included an uninjured control group  , and assessed a  dual-task paradigm .  Results  Forty-five full-text research reports were assessed  ,  of which 28 studies ( six ankle injury , nine knee injury , and 13 low back pain studies ) were included in the review .  Included studies were assessed for method ological quality and the study design extracted for analysis including the participants , cognitive and physical tasks performed , as well as outcome measures ( e.g. ,  three-dimensional kinematics , center of pressure , etc  .  )  . All studies included were cross-sectional or case – control with method ological quality scores of 17.8 ± 2.2 out of a possible 22 . Twenty-five of the 28 studies found  changes in motor performance  with  dual-task conditions  compared  with single tasks .  Furthermore , 54 % of studies reported a significant group by task interaction effect , reporting at least one alteration in injured groups ’  motor performance  under dual-task conditions when compared with an uninjured group . Conclusion The results of this systematic review indicate that  motor performance  is further impaired by placing a cognitive load on  individuals in population s with musculoskeletal injury .  More dem and ing tasks such as gait appear to be more affected in injured individuals than simple balance tasks . Future investigators may want to consider the difficulty of the tasks included as well as the impact of  dual-task paradigms  on rehabilitation programs."

"sAIM To review  outcomes  of   surgical and  antibiotic management  of  acute appendicitis .  METHODS  11 prospect i ve studies  comparing  surgical versus  antibiotic management  of acute appendicitis over a 21-year period  were review ed . RESULTS  Antibiotic management  is  successful  in most cases of uncomplicated acute appendicitis . The need for  crossover  in management and recurrent  appendicitis  were low among all studies . For those patients who ultimately required surgery , no increased  complications  were observed .  The decision to use  antibiotics  to treat acute appendicitis should be held to the same st and ards of diagnostic rigor as surgical management .  Antibiotics  may be  safely  recommended in patients with high surgical risk , such as the elderly or those with multiple comorbidities."
"sRATIONALE Many types of   pain  assessment  are available to research ers carrying out clinical trials in  chronic pelvic pain ( CPP )  , ranging from a single-item scale to multidimensional inventories . AIM Our objective was to investigate which assessment s of  pain  are more commonly used in clinical trials on CPP . METHOD  We have review ed articles published between 1991 and 2014 .  A total of  74 studies out of 1299 original research articles review ed  met the selection criteria by containing at least one method of pain assessment . The selected studies were classified according to the dimensions of pain evaluated , the type of scale and the descriptors used . RESULTS The instruments most frequently used were  single-item VAS and Biberoglu and Behrman pain score  , while multidimensional inventories were used in few studies . The results of clinical studies in CPP are more frequently based on one-dimensional measurements . Valuable results from clinical studies in CPP might have been omitted because of incomplete outcome measurements .  We believe the authors of clinical studies should report their results in a comprehensive way including in the outcomes of the measurement of one-dimensional and multidimensional pain characteristics."

" The efficacy of  azapirones  is uncertain due to the lack of meta-analysable data for the primary outcome and low- quality evidence for secondary efficacy outcomes . A small amount of moderate- quality evidence suggested that the acceptability of  azapirones  for panic disorder was lower than for  placebo .  However , only trials of one  azapirone  ( namely  buspirone )  were included in this review ; this , combined with the small sample size , limits our conclusions .

Methylpheni date  is a first-line treatment for ADHD , however no previous meta- analysis has evaluated its overall efficacy for ADHD in  children with comorbid intellectual disability ( ID ) or borderline intellectual functioning .  The PubMed / MEDLINE , Cochrane CENTRAL and ScienceDirect data bases were systematic ally search ed from inception through 2018/7/15 for clinical studies that investigated the effects of  methylpheni date  in children with ADHD and ID . A r and om-effects model meta- analysis was used for data synthesis .  Eight studies ( average Jadad score = 2.5 ) enrolling 242 participants receiving  methylpheni date  and 181 participants receiving  placebo  were included .  The meta- analysis showed  that methylpheni  date led to a significant  improvement in ADHD symptoms  relative to  placebo  ( Hedges ’ g = 0.878 , p < 0.001 ) . Meta-regression analysis pointed to an association between the dose of  methylpheni  date and  overall improvement in ADHD severity  ( slope = 1.334 , p < 0.001 ) . Finally , there was no significant difference in  drop-out rate  [ odds ratio ( OR ) = 1.679 , p = 0.260 ] or  rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events  ( OR = 4.815 , p = 0.053 ) between subjects  receiving methylpheni  date and those taking  placebos .  Our study suggests  that methylpheni  date retains its  efficacy  in children with ADHD and borderline intellectual functioning or ID."

"aPURPOSE OF REVIEW The aim of this review is to summarize important publications in   enhanced recovery  during 2010 - 2011  and to highlight key themes . Specifically , we focus on up date d systematic review s of high- quality clinical trials of  enhanced recovery  in   colorectal surgery   , exemplar studies of  enhanced recovery  in other specialties , and exploration of which elements of the  enhanced recovery package  might be associated with improved patient outcome . RECENT FINDINGS An exp and ing evidence base of clinical trials and implementation evaluations supports the effectiveness of  enhanced recovery programmes  in improving outcome following  major elective surgery  . The majority of this literature derives from the study of  patients undergoing colorectal surgery  , but increasingly  enhanced  recovery is spreading to other surgical specialties . The combination of  reduced length of hospital stay ( a surrogate for morbidity  ) with  no increase in readmissions to hospital  suggests that  morbidity  is reduced with  enhanced recovery .  Inconsistency in  morbidity reporting  limits the value of pooling data between studies , but within study comparisons in general support this conclusion .  Patients adhering  to an   enhanced recovery programme    return to normal function  faster than those following traditional care pathways . SUMMARY  Enhanced recovery  adoption is likely to continue to grow ( range of specialties and penetration within specialties ) . This progression is supported by the available published data."
" This systematic review shows that  hydrochlorothiazide  has a dose-related  blood pressure-lowering effect .  The mean  blood pressure-lowering  effect over the dose range 6.25 mg , 12.5 mg , 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg , 6/3 mmHg , 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg , respectively . For other thiazide drugs , the lowest doses studied lowered  blood pressure  maximally and higher doses did not lower it more . Due to the greater effect on  systolic  than on  diastolic blood pressure  ,  thiazides  lower  pulse pressure  by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg . This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg  pulse pressure reduction  achieved by ACE inhibitors , ARBs and renin inhibitors , and the 2 mmHg  pulse pressure reduction  with non-selective  beta-blockers  as shown in other Cochrane review s , which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with  placebo  and used similar inclusion /exclusion criteria .Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse  effects  in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome . Thiazides reduced potassium , increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides."

"ePurpose Infection is a concern after all orthopedic procedures , including  shoulder  surgery . This systematic review of literature aim ed to determine risk factors for infection as well as the availability and effectiveness of measures utilized to prevent infection after  elective shoulder surgery .  Methods An electronic data base search was performed using MEDLINE ( 1950–October 2017 ) , EMBASE ( 1980–October 2017 ) , CINAHL ( 1982–October 2017 ) , and the Cochrane data base to identify studies reporting a risk factor or preventive measure for infection  after shoulder surgery .  Results  Fifty-one studies were eligible for inclusion  . Risk factors identified for infection were male sex , the presence of hair , receiving an intra-articular  cortisone  injection within the 3 months prior to surgery , smoking , obesity , and several comorbidities . The only preventive measure with level I evidence was for the use of  chlorhexidine  wipes   for cleansing  the  skin in the days prior to surgery and for the  use of ChloraPrep or DuraPrep over povodine and iodine  to prep the skin at the time of surgery . Level II – IV evidence was found for other infection prevention methods such as intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis . Conclusion There are many risk factors associated with developing an infection after  elective shoulder surgery .  Many preventive measures have been described which may decrease the  risk of infection  ; however , most lack a high level evidence to support them . The findings of this systematic review are clinical ly relevant as it has been shown that infection after shoulder surgery results in poor  patient-reported outcomes  and pose a significant financial burden . As surgeons the goal should be to prevent infections to avoid the  morbidity for patients  and the increased  cost  for society . Level of evidence IV systematic review of literature."

Greater st and ardization of the variables related to this test is required.
"nTo date , the predominant mechanism underlying   menstrual disturbances  in  exercising  women  supports an underlying energy deficiency-related aetiology , in which a failure to compensate dietary intake for the energy cost of exercise suppresses reproductive function . Increasing evidence demonstrates that energy deficiency plays a causal role in the induction of amenorrhoea in   exercising  women  , and consistent with this mechanism are findings of glucoregulatory perturbations such as low triiodothyronine , reduced insulin secretion and elevated cortisol , growth hormone and ghrelin levels . The menstrual disturbance that may differ in its energetic characteristics and , perhaps in its and rogenic and ovarian steroid environment , is oligomenorrhoea . We conducted a systematic review of the literature to begin to underst and whether oligomenorrhoea in   exercising  women  is a mild sub clinical phenotype of polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) in which  exercise  is conferring beneficial effects in protecting women from the classic PCOS phenotype , or whether oligomenorrhoea is part of the spectrum of menstrual disturbances caused by an energy deficiency that is often reported in  exercising women with menstrual disturbances .  We included observational , r and omized controlled trials and cross-sectional studies that reported  clinical , hormonal and metabolic profiles  in   exercising  women with amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea and in women with PCOS .  Previous studies examining the underlying mechanisms and consequences of  exercise-associated menstrual disturbances  have grouped  exercising amenorrhoeic and oligomenorrhoeic women  into a single group , and have relied primarily on self-reported menstrual history . Although scarce , the data available to date suggest that  hyper and rogenism  , such as that observed in PCOS , may likely be associated with oligomenorrhoea in  exercising women  , and may not always represent hypothalamic inhibition secondary to an energy deficiency . It is critical to closely examine the metabolic and endocrine status of  women  with menstrual disturbances because the treatment strategies for energy deficiency-related  menstrual disturbances  differ from that of disturbances traceable to  hyper and rogenaemia .  Further investigation is necessary to explore whether different endocrine aetiologies underly  menstrual disturbances  , particularly  oligomenorrhoea  , in physically active women."
"nPURPOSE OF REVIEW Whether  statins  may prevent   atrial fibrillation   remains a subject of debate . An up date d systematic review of r and omized controlled trials with  statins  that collected data on the incidence or recurrence of  atrial fibrillation  was performed . RECENT FINDINGS  Thirty-two published studies with 71 005 patients were included in the analysis  . Overall , the use of  statins  was significantly associated with a decreased  risk of atrial fibrillation  compared with controls [ odds ratio ( OR ) 0.69 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.57 - 0.83 , P < 0.0001 ] with heterogeneous results . The benefit of  statin therapy  appeared highly significant for the prevention  of postoperative atrial fibrillation  ( homogeneous OR 0.37 , 95 % CI 0.28 - 0.51 , P < 0.00001 ) . Benefit was not apparent for the  prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation  ( OR 1.00 , 95 % CI 0.86 - 1.15 , P = 0.95 ) but was significant for secondary  prevention of atrial fibrillation  ( OR 0.57 , 95 % CI 0.36 - 0.91 , P = 0.02 with significant heterogeneity ) . There was no reduction in the  risk of atrial fibrillation  with more intensive vs. st and ard statin regimens ( OR 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.77 - 1.32 , P = 0.96 ) . SUMMARY The use of  statins  was significantly associated with a decreased  risk of  atrial fibrillation  in patients with sinus rhythm .  The highest benefit was seen for the prevention of  postoperative atrial fibrillation  and in secondary prevention of  atrial fibrillation  , with a heterogeneity that deserves further clarification."
"lBACKGROUND Several studies suggest that weight loss reduces  C-reactive protein  ( CRP ) level ; however , the consistency and magnitude of this effect has not been well characterized . Our objective was to test the hypothesis that weight loss is directly related to a decline in CRP level . DATA SOURCES We search ed the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and MEDLINE data bases and conducted h and search es and review s of bibliographies to identify relevant weight loss intervention studies . STUDY SELECTION We  included all  weight loss intervention  studies that had at least 1 arm that was a  surgical , lifestyle , dietary , and /or exercise intervention .   Abstract s were independently selected by 2 review ers . DATA EXTRACTION Two review ers independently abstract ed data on the characteristics of each study population ,  weight  loss intervention , and  change in weight and CRP level  from each arm of all included studies . DATA SYNTHESIS We analyzed the  mean change in CRP level  ( milligrams per liter ) and the  mean weight change  ( kilograms ) , comparing the preintervention and postintervention values from each arm of 33 included studies using graphical displays of these data and weighted regression analyses to quantify the association . RESULTS  Weight loss  was associated with a decline in  CRP level .  Across all studies  ( lifestyle and surgical interventions )  , we found that for each 1 kg of weight loss , the  mean change in CRP level  was -0.13 mg/L ( weighted Pearson correlation , r = 0.85 ) . The weighted  correlation for weight and change in CRP level  in the  lifestyle interventions  alone was 0.30 ( slope , 0.06 ) . The association appeared roughly linear .  Our results suggest that weight loss may be an effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering CRP level."
"pIn recent years , questions have been raised regarding the  cardiovascular safety  of  testosterone replacement therapy ( TRT ) .  The objective of this study was to systematic ally review the available evidence on  TRT  safety  in men  , specifically with respect to the  risk of stroke .  We identified publications from MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2017 . Articles eligible for review included observational studies evaluating   TRT  and the  risk of stroke  among men aged 18 or older .  R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing  testosterone to placebo   in men  were also eligible , provided stroke was identified as an adverse event . Among  seven cohort studies of hypogonadal men  , one study reported that  TRT  was associated with a significant decrease in the  risk of ischemic stroke  ( hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.64 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.52 - 0.80 ) . Another reported a similar decrease in risk ( HR 0.64 ; 95 % CI 0.43 - 0.96 ) among treated men who achieved normalized  levels of testosterone  . Limitations in study design , including immortal time bias and residual confounding , may have influenced both of these results . The remaining observational studies did not report measures of association to estimate the  independent risk of stroke  associated with  TRT .  Among eight RCTs , a low  frequency of stroke events  ( < 5 ) was observed across both testosterone and control groups , thus precluding any definitive conclusions . Based on these findings , the association between  TRT  and the   risk of stroke  in men  remains unclear , and further large and method ologically robust studies are needed to establish this relationship."
"eNecrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is a major cause of  mortality ( 25  %  ) and morbidity including recurrent sepsis , dependence on parenteral nutrition , need for surgery , and survival with short bowel syndrome  in  preterm very low birth weight infants  .  Mortality  ( 45 - 100 % ) and  morbidity including the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment  are higher in extremely  preterm infants needing surgery  for NEC . Systematic review s of r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) indicate that  probiotics  significantly reduce  the risk of NEC  ( RR 0.39 ; 95 % CI 0.29 - 0.52 ; p < 0.00001 )  and all-cause mortality  ( RR 0.52 ; 95 % CI 0.40 - 0.69 ; p < 0.00001 ) while facilitating enteral feeds in preterm infants . At present , data from  25 RCT ( ∼5,000 neonates ) and reports on routine use ( ∼3,000 neonates )  indicates that  significant adverse effects  of probiotics are rare . Despite the robust evidence , there is still reluctance in incorporating  routine probiotic prophylaxis  in clinical practice . If the goal is to have zero tolerance for NEC , then probiotic  prophylaxis  must be adopted as soon as possible . Current gaps in knowledge can be addressed by continued research while providing  routine probiotic supplementation .  We believe that the concept of evidence -based practice of medicine has been stretched too far in this case . Trial sequential analysis has already shown that the evidence  for  probiotic supplementation was conclusive after 10 trials . Results of the ongoing trials are unlikely to change the conclusions of the systematic review s significantly . Currently we are at trial number 25 ; how many more trials do we need ? What will it take to change clinical practice."
"eThis systematic review analysed the literature comparing marginal adaptation of  mineral trioxide aggregate  ( MTA  )  with other  filling material  s  in root-end cavities .  The PubMed , Ovid , Web of Science , SCOPUS , and Cochrane library data bases were search ed using appropriate keywords related to  root-end filling material  s and adaptation . Of  38 articles assessed , 20 met the inclusion criteria .  No in vivo study was identified . In 10 studies ,  MTA  gave the best  marginal adaptation results  , but no significant differences were found between MTA and any of the tested filling material s in seven studies . There was great variability in the study design s including analysed surface , unit of gap measurement and magnification amount during analysis . On the basis of available evidence ,  MTA  presented good marginal adaptation to dentine walls . This review identified the need for the development of st and ardised methods to evaluate the  adaptation property  of root-end filling material s in ex vivo studies as well as in clinical studies evaluating outcome."
" Adding  antiplatelet therapy , either dipyridamole or low-dose aspirin  , to oral anticoagulation decreases the risk of  systemic embolism  or death among  patients with prosthetic heart valves .  The risk of  major bleeding  is increased with antiplatelet  therapy .  These results apply to  patients with mechanical prosthetic valves or those with biological valves  and indicators of  high  risk such as atrial fibrillation or prior thromboembolic events . The  effectiveness and safety  of low-dose  aspirin  ( 100 mg daily ) appears to be similar to higher-dose  aspirin and dipyridamole .  In general , the  quality of  the included trials tended to be low , possibly reflecting the era when the majority of the trials were conducted ( 1970s and 1980s when trial methodology was less advanced )."
" In general , evidence was of low quality due to lack of blinding , loss to follow-up , and uncertainty around the effect size . Few studies measured  clinical events  , and of those that did , a very small number  of  events were reported , and therefore no firm conclusions can be made . Similarly , there was no clear evidence of effect for  cardiovascular risk factors  , although again the number of studies reporting these was small . There was some evidence for beneficial effects on  HRQOL , dietary outcomes , and physical activity  , although firm conclusions can not yet be made . The effects on  healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness  are also inconclusive , and trials are yet to measure the impact of   Internet  interventions  on compliance with medication . The comparison groups differed across trials , and there were insufficient studies with usable data for subgroup analyses . We intend to study the intensity of comparison groups in future up date s of this review when more evidence is available . The completion of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base."

"tAim  Exercise  is one of the most important components in  frailty  prevention and treatment  .  Therefore , we systematic ally review ed the effect of  resistance training ( RT ) alone or combined with multimodal exercise intervention  on  muscle hypertrophy , maximal strength , power output , functional performance , and falls incidence  in  physically frail elderly .  Methods MEDLINE , Cochrane CENTRAL , PEDro , and SPORTD iscus data bases were search ed from 2005 to  2017  . Studies must have mentioned the effects of  RT  ( i.e. , included or not in multimodal training ) on at least one of the following parameters :  muscle mass , muscle strength , muscle power , functional capacity , and risk of falls  in frail elderly . Results The initial  search identified 371 studies and 16 were used  for  qualitative analysis  for describing the effect of strength training performed alone or in a multimodal  exercise intervention  . We observed  that RT  alone or in a multimodal training may induce increases of 6.6–37 % in  maximal strength ; 3.4–7.5  %  in muscle mass , 8.2 % in muscle power , 4.7–58.1 % in functional capacity and risk of falls  , although some studies did not show enhancements . Conclusion Frequency of 1–6 sessions per week , training volume of 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions and intensity of 30–70%1-RM promoted significant enhancements  on muscle strength , muscle power , and functional outcomes .  Therefore , in agreement with previous studies , we suggest that supervised and controlled  RT  represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment."

"sOBJECTIVES This study systematic ally review the literature to assess the  effectiveness  of  antibacterial monomers  incorporated into  dental adhesive systems against major oral bacteria ;  as well as the research advances and the future prospect s of this technology . METHODS The following seven data bases were screened : MedLine ( PubMed ) , Lilacs , Ibecs , Web of Science , Scopus , Scielo , and The Cochrane Library . Furthermore , the online system Questel Orbit ( Paris , France ) was accessed to obtain patent data . The inclusion criteria were articles and patents that investigated the  antimicrobial activity  of  antibacterial monomers  in   dental adhesive systems .  Only documents written in English , Spanish or Portuguese were included  . RESULTS After screening ,  33 studies and eight patents fulfilled  all the criteria and  were included  . Antibacterial agents , such as QA , MDPB , DMAHM and DMADDM were found in patents , which cl aim ed their incorporation into adhesive compositions , dental cements , composite resins . MDPB was the only antimicrobial monomer incorporated into a commercially available adhesive system ,  Clearfil Protect Bond  ™ ( Kuraray Co. Ltd. , Japan ) . All studies reported the inclusion of  antimicrobial monomers  in adhesive systems to be an effective dental treatment strategy . SIGNIFICANCE There are potential areas to be explored with  antibacterial monomers  for dentistry , and their use could have important implication s for future more conservative dental treatments . Although there is evidence of  antibacterial activity  from in vitro studies , clinical studies must be conducted to confirm the effectiveness of these material s in the prevention of dental pathologies."

"sAbstract Sarcopenia is a potentially modifiable risk factor for  falls and fractures  in  older adults  , but the strength of the association between sarcopenia , falls , and fractures is unclear . This study aims to systematic ally assess the literature and perform a meta‐ analysis of the association between sarcopenia with  falls and fractures among older adults .  A literature search was performed using MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane , and CINAHL from inception to May 2018 .  Inclusion criteria were the following : published in English , mean/median age ≥ 65 years , sarcopenia diagnosis ( based on definitions used by the original studies ' authors ) , falls and /or fractures outcomes , and any study population .  Pooled analyses were conducted of the associations of sarcopenia with  falls and  fractures , expressed in odds ratios ( OR ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) . Subgroup analyses were performed by study design , population , sex , sarcopenia definition , continent , and study quality . Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistics . The  search identified 2771 studies . Thirty‐six studies ( 52 838 individuals , 48.8 % females , and mean age of the study population s ranging from 65.0 to 86.7 years ) were included in the systematic review .  Four studies reported on  both falls and fractures  . Ten out of 22 studies reported a  significantly higher risk of falls  in sarcopenic compared with non‐sarcopenic individuals ; 11 out of 19 studies showed a significant positive  association with fractures  .  Thirty‐three studies ( 45 926 individuals ) were included in the meta‐ analysis . Sarcopenic individuals  had a  significant higher risk of falls  ( cross‐sectional studies : OR 1.60 ; 95 % CI 1.37–1.86 , P < 0.001 , I 2 = 34 % ; prospect i ve studies : OR 1.89 ; 95 % CI 1.33–2.68 , P < 0.001 , I 2 =  37 % ) and fractures  ( cross‐sectional studies : OR 1.84 ; 95 % CI 1.30–2.62 , P = 0.001 , I 2 = 91 % ; prospect i ve studies : OR 1.71 ; 95 % CI 1.44–2.03 , P = 0.011 , I 2 = 0 % ) compared with non‐sarcopenic individuals . This was independent of study design , population , sex , sarcopenia definition , continent , and study quality . The positive association between sarcopenia with  falls and  fractures in older adults strengthens the need to invest in  sarcopenia prevention and interventions  to evaluate its effect on falls and fractures."

"tStrengths  assessment s  focus on the individual 's talents , abilities , re sources , and strengths . No systematic review of  strengths assessment s  for use within  mental health population s  has been published . The aims of this study were to describe and evaluate  strengths assessment s   for use within mental health services .  A systematic review identified  12  strengths assessment  s ( 5 quantitative , 7 qualitative ) .  The  Strengths Assessment Worksheet ( SAW )  was the most widely utilized and evaluated qualitative assessment .  Psychometric properties  of the  assessment  s were assessed against set quality criteria . Data on  psychometric properties  were available for 4 measures . The Client  Assessment of Strengths , Interests and Goals  ( CASIG ) had the strongest psychometric evidence . The SAW and CASIG  assessment  s can be tentatively recommended within clinical practice , although the evidence for all strengths  assessment  s is currently limited . To describe the content of the  strengths assessment  , the items used to operationalize the concept of strengths in each  assessment  were extracted and themed . Twenty-four themes were identified and organized into 3 overarching categories : individual factors ,  environmental factors  , and  interpersonal factors  . These categories form the basis of an empirically based definition of  strengths  that could be used as a conceptual foundation for new clinical assessment."

"sThis systematic review and meta- analysis of intervention studies aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative  and /or post-operative support  for  adults who elect  bariatric surgery  delivered  by a multidisciplinary team ( MDT )   on post-operative body composition , mental health , co-morbidities , quality of life , and side effects . Six electronic data bases were search ed . Revman and GRADE were used to assess confidence in pooled effects . Included interventions ( N =  1533 participants in total )  focused on  lifestyle counselling  ( n = 4 studies ) ,  psychology  ( n = 4 studies ) , or  exercise  ( n = 10 studies ) ; comparator groups were  less intensive usual care . Intensive MDT interventions  increased  post-operative weight loss  ( SMD : -0.94 ; 95 % CI : -1.27 to -0.61 ) if delivered post-operatively . Preoperative and post-operative intensive interventions  improved symptoms of depression and anxiety , quality of life , diastolic blood pressure , and resting heart rate but not lipids or glycaemic measures .  Whilst usual MDT care is important preoperatively , this review conditionally recommends  intensive MDT interventions  for enhanced  post-operative weight loss  if delivered in the post-operative period , led by any health professional , based on moderate evidence . This review also conditionally recommends  preoperative and /or post-operative  lifestyle , nutrition  , or  psychology counselling  and /or  physical activity   for  improved mental and physical health .  Further r and omized controlled trials are required , which aim to specifically evaluate the best use of MDT re sources."

"hObjectives : Research on  labor pain  currently uses st and ard scores such as numerical scales as clinical outcomes , but no clear guidelines for such an assessment have appeared since a review published in 1998 . We aim ed to describe and estimate the quality of the methods used to assess and analyze such outcomes in a systematic review of  215 comparative studies published since then in 27 influential journals .  Methods : In addition to a complete description , we created for each study a composite  “ analysis quality score ” ( AQS )  on the basis of the methods of both  measurement of pain/analgesia  , and  statistical analysis  . AQS was tested against various factors , including a  “ design quality score ” ( DQS )  , created to estimate method ological quality ( regardless of the analysis of pain intensity ) . Results : Both the AQS and its “ measurement ” component increased with the year of publication , as well as the DQS . The  impact factor  correlated only with the statistical component of the AQS , and with the DQS . However , the  mean AQS and DQS  were , respectively , at 43 % and 75 % of their maximal possible value , and these 2 scores were not correlated . The  intensity of labor pain ( or pain relief )  was the primary outcome in 19 % of the studies . Although most of the studies actually used numerical scales , the methods of analysis were heterogeneous . When a cutoff point was determined to define  analgesia  , this was most often 30 % of the maximal value . Discussion : This review points out the need for a better st and ardization of the methods in this field of research."

"hBackground The aim of this study was to systematic ally review the content validity and measurement properties of all  physical function  (  PF  )  scales  which are currently vali date d for use with  patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .  Methods Systematic literature search es were performed in the Scopus and PubMed data bases to identify articles on the development or psychometric evaluation of  PF scales  for  patients with RA .  The content validity of included scales was evaluated by linking their items to the  International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health ( ICF )  . Furthermore , available evidence of the reliability , validity , responsiveness , and interpretability of the included scales was rated according to published quality criteria . Results The search identified 26 question naires with PF  scales  . Ten question naires were rated to have adequate content validity .  Construct validity , internal consistency , test-retest reliability and responsiveness  was rated favourably for respectively 15 , 11 , 5 , and 6 of the investigated scales . Information about the  absolute measurement error and minimal important change scores  were rarely reported . Conclusion Based on this literature review , the disease-specificHAQ and the generic SF-36 can currently be most confidently recommended to measure PF in RA for most research purpose s. The HAQ , however , was frequently associated with considerable ceiling effects while the SF-36 has limited content coverage . Alternative scales that might be better suited for specific research purpose s are identified along with future directions for research."

"4Background : Recent systematic review s have suggested that  pedometers  may be effective motivational tools to promote walking . However , studies tend to be of a relatively short duration , with small clinical based sample s. Further research is required to demonstrate their effectiveness in adequately powered , community based studies . Objective : Using a r and omized controlled trial design , this study assessed the impact of a 12-week  graduated pedometer-based walking intervention  on daily  step-counts  ,  self-reported physical activity  and  health outcomes  in a  Scottish community sample not meeting current physical activity recommendations .  Method :  Sixty-three women and 16 men ( 49.2 years ± 8.8 ) were r and omly  assigned to either an  intervention ( physical activity consultation and 12-week pedometer-based walking program ) or control ( no action ) group  . Measures  for step-counts , 7-day physical activity recall , affect , quality of life  ( n = 79 )  , body mass , BMI , % body fat , waist and hip circumference  ( n = 76 )  , systolic/diastolic blood pressure , total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol  ( n = 66 ) were taken at baseline and week 12 . Analyses were performed on an intention to treat basis using 2-way mixed factorial analyses of variance for parametric data and Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon tests for non-parametric data . Results : Significant increases were found in the intervention group  for step-counts  ( p < .001 ) ,  time spent in leisure walking  ( p = .02 ) and  positive  affect ( p = .027 ) . Significant decreases were found in this group  for time spent in weekday  ( p = .003 ) ,  weekend  ( p = .001 ) and  total sitting  ( p = .001 ) with no corresponding changes in the control group . No significant changes in any other  health outcomes  were found in either group . In comparison with the control group at week 12 , the intervention group reported a significantly  greater number of minutes spent in leisure time  ( p = Published : 5 September 2008 International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2008 , 5:44 doi:10.1186/1479 - 5868 - 5 - 44 Received : 18 January 2008 Accepted : 5 September 2008 This article is available from : http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/5/1/44 © 2008 Baker et al ; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

"sINTRODUCTION The increasing prevalence of  type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )  presents a significant burden on affected individuals and healthcare systems internationally . There is , however , no agreed vali date d measure to infer diabetes severity from  electronic health records  ( EHRs ) . We aim to quantify T2DM severity and vali date it using clinical adverse outcomes . METHODS AND ANALYSIS  Primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Data link , linked hospitalisation and mortality records between April 2007 and March 2017 for patients with T2DM in Engl and will  be  used  to develop a clinical algorithm to grade T2DM severity . The EHR-based algorithm will incorporate main risk factors ( severity domains ) for adverse outcomes to stratify T2DM cohorts by baseline and longitudinal severity scores . Provisionally , T2DM severity domains , identified through a systematic review and expert opinion , are :  diabetes duration , glycated haemoglobin , microvascular complications , comorbidities  and coprescribed  treatments  . Severity scores will be developed by two approaches : ( 1 ) calculating a count score of severity domains ; ( 2 ) through hierarchical stratification of complications . Regression models estimates will be used to calculate domains weights .  Survival analyses  for the association between weighted severity scores and future  outcomes -cardiovascular events , hospitalisation ( diabetes-related , cardiovascular ) and mortality ( diabetes-related , cardiovascular , all-cause mortality)-will  be performed as statistical validation . The proposed EHR-based approach will quantify the T2DM severity for primary care performance management and inform the methodology for measuring severity of other primary care-managed chronic conditions . We anticipate that the developed algorithm will be a practical tool for practitioners , aid clinical management decision-making , inform stratified medicine , support future clinical trials and contribute to more effective service planning and policy-making . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study protocol was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee . Some data were presented at the National Institute for Health Research School for Primary Care Research Showcase , September 2017 , Oxford , UK and the Diabetes UK Professional Conference March 2018 , London , UK . The study findings will be disseminated in relevant academic conferences and peer- review ed journals."
"sBackground  Overactive bladder (OAB)/ storage lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS )  have a high prevalence affecting up to 90 % of  men over 80 years  . The role of sufficient therapies appears crucial . In the present review , we analyzed the mechanism of action of  tolterodine extended-release ( ER )  with the aim to clarify its  efficacy  and safety profile , as compared to other active treatments of OAB/storage LUTS . Methods A wide Medline search was performed including the combination of following words :  “ LUTS ”  ,  “ BPH ”  ,  “ OAB ”  ,   “  antimuscarinic   ” , “ tolterodine ” , “ tolterodine ER ”  .  IPSS , IPSS storage sub-score  and  IPSS QoL ( International Prostate Symptom Score )  were the vali date d efficacy outcomes . In addition , the numbers of urgency episodes/24 h , urgency incontinence episodes/24 h , incontinence episodes/24 h and pad use were considered . We also evaluated the most common  adverse events ( AEs )  reported for  tolterodine ER .  Results Of  128 retrieved articles , 109 were excluded .  The  efficacy and tolerability  of  tolterodine ER Vs . tolterodine IR  have been evaluated in a multicenter , double-blind , r and omized  placebo  controlled study in  1529 patients with OAB .  A 71 % mean  reduction in urgency incontinence episodes  was found in the  tolterodine  ER group compared to a 60 % reduction in the  tolterodine  IR ( p < 0.05 ) . Few studies evaluated the  clinical efficacy  of  α-blocker/tolterodine  combination therapy . In  patients with large prostates  ( prostate volume > 29 cc ) only the combination therapy significantly  reduced 24-h voiding frequency  ( 2.8 vs. 1.7  with tamsulosin  , 1.4  with tolterodine  , or 1.6  with placebo  ) . A recent meta- analysis evaluating  tolterodine  in comparison with other antimuscarinic drugs demonstrated that  tolterodine ER  was significantly more effective than  placebo  in  reducing micturition/24 h , urinary leakage episodes/24 h , urgency episodes/24 h , and urgency incontinence episodes/24 h.  With regard to adverse  events , tolterodine ER  was associated with a good adverse event profile result ing in the third most favorable antimuscarinic  . Antimuscarinic drugs  are the mainstay of pharmacological therapy for OAB / storage LUTS ; several studies have demonstrated  that tolterodine  ER is an effective and well tolerated formulation of this class of treatment . Conclusion  Tolterodine  ER result ed effective in reducing  frequency urgency and nocturia  and  urinary leakage  in  male patients with OAB/storage LUTS .   Dry mouth and constipation  are the most frequently reported adverse events."
"eBackground / Aims : Treatment adherence is a major problem in numerous medical conditions , and is a particular challenge in  patients with Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .  Methods : This non- systematic review summarises the current literature on factors that affect adherence to  cholinesterase inhibitors  , the mainstay of AD treatment . Articles listed on PubMed and published during the last 10 years were included . Results : Intentional factors affecting adherence include patient , caregiver and prescriber beliefs about therapies and the disease itself . Unintentional factors include  tolerability , physical limitations of the patient and caregiver burden .  Interventions aim ing to improve adherence include  educational programmes and new drug delivery methods .  Conclusion : Due to the high level of  caregiver  involvement in the  care  of  patients with AD  , strategies that address caregiver concerns may improve adherence."
"eThis study aims to review the obesity literature in order to assess the impact of  bariatric surgery  on  quality of life  and the between- study variation by examining the st and ardized mean magnitude of effect in change in the levels of quality of life . The following data bases EMBASE , PubMed , PsycINFO , CINAHL , the Cochrane Library and Web of Science were systematic ally search ed for studies examining change in  quality of life  in  adults receiving  bariatric surgery  for obesity . Seventy-two studies were included with a total of 9,433 participants treated for obesity with  bariatric surgery .   The average impact of  bariatric surgery  on  quality of life  corresponded to an effect size of 0.88 ( 95 % CI : 0.80 - 0.96 ) , indicating that  bariatric surgery  has a significant positive influence on  quality of life  in general . The impact varied considerably across studies with  bariatric surgery  showing a significantly greater positive influence on  physical quality of life compared  to  mental quality of life .   Bariatric surgery  is effective in improving  quality of life  , especially when looking at physical well-being . Greater focus on the psychological well-being of the person undergoing surgery for obesity may lead to a better post-surgery prognosis for more people."
" The meta- analysis showed a significant increase  in plasma adiponectin  levels  following statin therapy . Although statins  are known to increase the risk for new onset diabetes mellitus , our data might suggest that the mechanism for this is unlikely to be due to a reduction in adiponectin expression."
"tPycnogenol is a st and ardized extract from the bark of the  French maritime pine .  The aim of the present systematic review and meta- analysis was to clarify the effect of  Pycnogenol supplementation  on  C-reactive protein ( CRP ) concentration .  To identify eligible studies in order to find clinical trials which examined the effect of  Pycnogenol supplementation  on the  level of  CRP  in adult participants  , PubMed , Scopus , and Google Scholar were systematic ally search ed until December 2017 .  Mean of CRP  was collected to estimate the effect size of the supplementation . Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis .  Five trials including 324 participants were included in this meta- analysis .  Pooled effect size showed significant effect of  Pycnogenol supplementation  on  CRP  ( -1.22 mg/dL , 95 % confidence interval , -2.43 , -0.003 ; I2 = 99 % , pheterogeneity < 0.001 ) . When the meta- analysis was subgrouped by dose  of Pycnogenol  , heterogeneity was attenuated in > 150 mg/d category ( I2 = 0.0 % , p = 0.42 ) . There was significant difference between-subgroup  heterogeneity  ( p < 0.001 ) . Furthermore , no evidence of  publication bias for CRP  ( p = 0.27 , Begg 's test and p = 0.62 , Egger 's test ) was seen . Present systematic review and meta- analysis  suggested Pycnogenol  consumption can  decrease the level of CRP and have anti-inflammatory effect .  So ,  Pycnogenol  as an anti-inflammatory agent might be a priority in interventions . Further studies with large-scale and better design are needed to confirm this result."
"yDespite intensive efforts to underst and the extent to which skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity changes in  older humans  , the answer to this important question remains unclear . To determine what the preponderance of evidence from in vivo studies suggests , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of the effects of age on muscle oxidative capacity as measured noninvasively by  magnetic resonance spectroscopy .  A secondary aim was to examine potential moderators contributing to differences in results across studies , including muscle group , physical activity status , and sex . C and i date papers were identified from PubMed  search es ( n = 3561 papers )  and the reference lists of relevant papers .  St  and ardized  effects ( Hedges ' g )  were calculated for age and each moderator using data from the  22 studies that met the inclusion criteria  ( n  = 28 effects  ) . Effects were coded as positive when older ( age , ≥55 years ) adults had  higher muscle oxidative capacity  than younger ( age , 20 - 45 years ) adults . The  overall effect of age on oxidative capacity  was positive ( g = 0.171 , p < 0.001 ) , indicating modestly greater  oxidative  capacity in old . Notably , there was significant heterogeneity in this result ( Q = 245.8 , p < 0.001 ; I2 = ∼70%-90 % )  . Muscle group , physical activity , and sex  were all significant moderators  of oxidative capacity  ( p ≤ 0.029 ) . This analysis indicates that the current body of literature does not support a de facto decrease  of in vivo muscle oxidative capacity  in old age . The heterogeneity of study results and identification of significant moderators provide clarity regarding apparent discrepancies in the literature , and indicate the importance of accounting for these variables when examining purported age-related differences in muscle oxidative capacity."
"yOBJECTIVE To compare  surgical versus medical  treatment   of   type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) remission  and comorbidities in patients with a body mass index ( BMI ) less than 35 kg/m2 .  BACKGROUND  Obesity surgery  can achieve  remission  of  T2DM  and its comorbidities .  Metabolic surgery  has been proposed as a treatment option for  diabetic patients with BMI less than 35 kg/m2  but the  efficacy  of  metabolic surgery  has not been conclusively determined . METHODS A systematic literature search identified  r and omized ( RCT ) and nonr and omized  comparative   observational  clinical studies   ( OCS )  evaluating  surgical versus medical T2DM treatment  in  patients with BMI less than 35 kg/m2 .  The primary outcome was  T2DM remission .  Additional analyses comprised  glycemic control , BMI , HbA1c level , remission of comorbidities , and safety .  R and om effects meta-analyses were calculated and presented as weighted odds ratio ( OR ) or mean difference ( MD ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) . RESULTS  Five  RCTs  and 6 OCSs ( 706 total T2DM patients )  were included . Follow-up ranged from 12 to 36 months .  Metabolic surgery  was associated with a  higher T2DM remission rate  ( OR : 14.1 , 95 % CI : 6.7 - 29.9 , P < 0.001 ) ,  higher rate of glycemic control  ( OR : 8.0 , 95 % CI : 4.2 - 15.2 , P < 0.001 ) and  lower HbA1c level  ( MD : -1.4 % , 95 % CI -1.9 % to -0.9 % , P < 0.001 ) than medical  treatment . BMI  ( MD -5.5 kg/m2 , 95 % CI : -6.7 to -4.3 kg/m2 , P < 0.001 ) ,  rate of arterial hypertension  ( OR : 0.25 , 95 % CI : 0.12 - 0.50 , P < 0.001 ) and  dyslipidemia  ( OR : 0.21 , 95 % CI : 0.10 - 0.44 , P < 0.001 ) were lower after surgery .   Metabolic surgery  is superior to medical treatment for  short-term remission of T2DM and comorbidities  . Further RCTs should address the long-term effects  on T2DM  complications and mortality."
"tIt is commonly assumed that a person identifying that they are  '  overweight ' is an important prerequisite to successful weight management . However , there has been no systematic evaluation of evidence supporting this proposition . The aim of the present research was to systematic ally review evidence on the relationship between perceived overweight and ( i )  weight loss attempts  , ( ii )   weight control strategies ( healthy and unhealthy )   , ( iii )  weight-related behaviours ( physical activity and eating habits )  , ( iv )  disordered eating  and ( v )  weight change .  We synthesized evidence from  78 eligible studies  and evaluated evidence linking perceived overweight with outcome variables separately according to the  gender , age and objective weight status of study participants .  Results indicated that perceived overweight was associated with an increased likelihood of  attempting weight loss  and with  healthy and unhealthy weight control strategies  in some participant groups . However , perceived overweight was not reliably associated with  physical activity or healthy eating  and was associated with  greater disordered eating  in some groups . Rather than being associated with  improved weight management  , there was consistent evidence that perceived overweight was predictive of increased  weight gain  over time .  Individuals who perceive their weight status as overweight  are more likely to report attempting  weight loss  but over time gain more weight."
" This systematic and meta-analyses indicates that  functional  outcomes for  patients undergoing  active robotic total hip  and  knee  arthroplasty  were comparable to conventional surgery .  Whether semi-active or active robotic hip or knee arthroplasty  is effective in improving  post-operative pain , quality of life and satisfaction  with surgery is unclear .

"lModern   TKR  prostheses  are design ed to restore healthy kinematics including high flexion . Kneeling is a dem and ing high-flexion activity . There have been many studies of  kneeling kinematics  using a plethora of implant design s but no comprehensive comparisons . Visualisation of contact patterns allows for quantification and comparison of  knee kinematics .  The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether there are any differences in the  kinematics of kneeling  as a function of  TKR  design . A search of the published literature identified  26 articles  which were  assessed  for method ologic quality using the MINORS instrument .  Contact patterns  for different implant design s were compared at 90 ° and maximal flexion using quality -effects meta- analysis models .  Twenty-five different implants using six design s were reported .  Most of the included studies had  small- sample sizes  , were non-consecutive , and did not have a direct comparison group . Only  posterior-stabilised fixed-bearing and cruciate-retaining fixed-bearing design s   had data for more than 200 participants .  Meta-analyses revealed that bicruciate-stabilised fixed-bearing design s appeared to achieve  more flexion  and the cruciate-retaining rotating-platform design achieved the least , but both included single studies only . All design s  demonstrated posterior – femoral translation and external rotation  in  kneeling  , but posterior-stabilised design s were  more posterior  at maximal flexion when compared to cruciate retaining . However , the heterogeneity of the mean estimates was substantial , and therefore , firm conclusions about relative behaviour can not be drawn . The high heterogeneity may be due to a combination of variability in the kneeling activity and variations in implant geometry within each design category . There remains a need for a high- quality prospect i ve comparative studies to directly compare design s using a common method . Systematic review and meta- analysis Level."
"sBACKGROUND Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by the clinical presentation of identifiable physical alterations and decreased physiological reserve . The assessment of frailty syndrome has been recently related with  post-surgical outcomes and overall mortality  in  older individuals .  DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES We performed search es in Pubmed , Embase , Scopus , SCIELO and IME ( Spanish medical index ) data bases from their start date s to February 2014 for original papers about the identification of the relationship between frailty and  pre-operative risk evaluation  in  people aged 65 and over .  REVIEW METHODS We followed criteria of systematic PRISMA guidelines . Two independent review ers extracted descriptive information on frailty criteria and outcomes from the selected papers : of  the 77 articles retrieved from the search es , 32 met the study inclusion criteria .  RESULTS  Severity of frailty syndrome significantly correlated with post-surgical mortality rates and with many although not all post-surgical complications .  These relationships emerge in different type of surgical procedures and patients ' features . The comparison of diagnostic tools to assess frailty in pre-operative  risk  evaluation are very few and to date , no recommendation can be made about the best scale to measure it .  Assessment of frailty syndrome should be added in the pre-operative risk assessment in older individuals."
"nDifferent  early intervention programs  , developed predominantly in the US , for  preschool aged children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD )  have been published . Several systematic review articles including a German Health Technology Assessment on  behavioural and skill-based early interventions  in  children with ASD  reported insufficient evidence and a substantial problem of generalisability to the German context . In Germany , approx . 2–5 h  early intervention  is supported by social services . Here , we report the results of a 1 year pre – post pilot study on a  developmentally based social pragmatic approach  , the  Frankfurt Early Intervention program FFIP  . In FFIP , individual 2:1 ,  behaviourally and developmentally based therapy with the child  is combined with  parent training and training of kindergarten teachers .  Treatment frequency is 2 h/week . Outcome measures were the  Vinel and Adaptive Behaviour Scales II ( VABS ) , mental age and the ADOS severity score .  Improvements after 1 year were observed for  the VABS socialisation scale and the mental age quotient/IQ  ( medium effect sizes ) . Results are comparable with several other studies with a similar or slightly higher therapeutic intensity implementing comparable or different early intervention methods or programs . Compared to most high-intensity programs ( 30–40 h/week  )  ,  lower cognitive gains  were observed . Results have to be replicated and assessed by a r and omized-controlled study before any final conclusions can be drawn."

"hBACKGROUND A wide array of instruments are available for non-invasive  thoracic kyphosis  measurement . Guidelines for selecting outcome measures for use in clinical and research practice recommend that properties such as validity and reliability are considered . This systematic review reports on the reliability and validity of  non-invasive methods  for measuring   thoracic kyphosis  .  METHODS A systematic search of  11 electronic data bases located studies assessing reliability and /or validity of  non-invasive thoracic kyphosis measurement techniques .   Two independent review ers used a critical appraisal tool to assess the quality of retrieved studies . Data was extracted by the primary review er . The results were synthesized qualitatively using a level of evidence approach . RESULTS  27 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria and were included in the review .   The reliability , validity and both reliability and validity  were investigated by sixteen , two and nine studies respectively . 17/27 studies were deemed to be of high quality . In total , 15 methods of thoracic kyphosis were evaluated in retrieved studies . All investigated methods showed  high ( ICC ≥ .7 )  to  very high ( ICC ≥  .9  ) levels of reliability . The validity  of the methods ranged from low to very high .  The strongest levels of evidence for reliability exists in support of the Debrunner kyphometer , Spinal Mouse and Flexicurve index , and for validity supports the arcometer and Flexicurve index . Further reliability and validity studies are required to strengthen the level of evidence for the remaining methods of measurement . This should be addressed by future research."
"sBACKGROUND  Children and adolescents with congenital heart disease  often have alterations in their exercise capacity that can be evaluated by various functional testing . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the functional  capacity  of  children and adolescents with congenital heart disease ( CHD )  with systematic review and meta-analyses . METHODS The review included observational studies , data from the first evaluation of r and omized clinical trials or observational follow-up periods after clinical trials which evaluated functional  capacity  by  cardiopulmonary exercise test , stress testing , six-minute walk test or step test  , in  children and adolescents with CHD , aged between six and 18 years , and comparisons with healthy controls in the same age group .  The quantitative assessment was performed by meta- analysis , by comparing the  maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max )  of children and adolescents with CHD and respective control groups . RESULTS  Twenty-five of 2.683 studies identified in the search met  the inclusion criteria . The  VO2max measurement  showed that patients with CHD have a decrease of 9.31 ml/Kg/min ( 95 % CI . -12.48 to -6.13 ; I2 , 94.3 % , P for heterogeneity < 0.001 ) compared with the control group . The meta- analysis of the data of  maximum heart rate ( HR )  reached during cardiopulmonary test and stress testing , retrieved from 18 studies , showed a  HR value  of -15.14 bpm ( 95 % CI . -20.97 to -9.31 ; I2 , 94.3 % , P for heterogeneity < 0.001 ) compared with the control group .   Children and adolescents with CHD  have lower  VO2max and HR  compared to controls."
"sBACKGROUND The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology ( OMERACT ) initiative developed a core outcome set ( COS ) of domains to assess effectiveness of interventions for  knee osteoarthritis .  These domains ( pain , physical function , patient global assessment , imaging at 1 year ) should be assessed in every trial to make research evidence meaningful and comparable . We systematic ally evaluated and critically appraised the use of  measurement instruments  and  outcome domains  in prospect i ve studies evaluating  patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing total knee arthroplasty ( TKA )  and assessed their accordance with the OMERACT COS . METHODS Literature search was performed until August  26  ,  2014  , in Medline and Embase  .  Clinical trials and prospect i  ve observational studies with ≥50 participants and a follow-up of ≥1 year  were included . We collected general study characteristics , comprehensive information on measurement instruments , and corresponding domains used . RESULTS This systematic review identified low accordance of used outcome domains with the OMERACT COS of domains published in 1997 . Only  4 of 100 included studies  included all recommended core domains .  Pain  ( 85 % of studies )  and physical function  ( 86 % ) were assessed frequently ,  whereas patient global assessment  ( 21 % )  and joint imaging  ( ≥1 year ; 27 % ) were rarely assessed . There was substantial heterogeneity in the use of measurement instruments ( n = 111 ) investigating TKA .  More efforts are required to implement the existing COS . In addition , a more consistent use of adequate measurement instruments is important to make research evidence on TKA more relevant , better comparable , and thus more useful for guideline developers and clinical decision makers."
" In this network meta- analysis , we demonstrated that SeR did not show clinical ly meaningful improvement in LUTS and PF . PATIENT SUMMARY In the present study , we found no clinical ly meaningful improvement of  Serenoa repens  for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic enlargement . The analysis showed that the benefit over placebo was minimal and may not justify its clinical use before higher level of evidence will be available."
"tOBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of  probiotic therapies  on  body weight  and BMI   using a meta- analysis of r and omized , controlled trials . METHODS  Twenty studies with 25 trials ( 1931 participants with age over 18 years ) were included .  The pooled WMD was calculated by r and om effects model .  RESULTS Probiotic consumption  significantly  reduced body weight  by 0.59 kg ( 95 % CI , 0.30 - 0.87 )  and BMI  by 0.49 kg/m(2 ) ( 95 % CI , 0.24 - 0.74 ) . A greater  reduction in BMI  was found with multiple species of probiotics . Subgroup analysis of trials with intervention duration ≥8 weeks found a more significant  reduction in BMI  . Limiting analysis to trials with a baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m(2 ) showed a greater  reduction in BMI  .   Consuming probiotics   could reduce body weight and BMI  , with a potentially greater effect when multiple species of probiotics were consumed , the duration of intervention was ≥8 weeks , or the objects were overweight."
"  PSI  for TKA has not reliably demonstrated improvement of postoperative limb or component alignment when compared with st and  ard instrumentation  . Although decisive evidence exists to support that  PSI  requires fewer surgical trays ,  PSI  has not clearly been shown to improve overall  surgical efficiency  or the  cost-effectiveness  of TKA . Mid- and long-term data regarding  PSI  ’s effect on  functional outcomes  and  component survivorship  do not exist and short-term data are scarce . Limited available literature does not clearly support any improvement of  postoperative pain , activity , function , or ROM  when  PSI  is compared with traditional instrumentation."
" Study -level data from this systemic review establish that different lipid lowering agents can lead to discordance between  LDL-P  and  LDL-C  , therefore , basing LDL-lowering therapy only on the achievement of cholesterol goals may result in a treatment gap . Therefore , the use of LDL-P for monitoring lipid-lowering therapy , particularly for  statins  , can provide a more accurate assessment of residual cardiovascular risk."
" : Several specialized  psychotherapeutic interventions  have been developed and can be recommended for AN . However ,  adult and adolescent patients  should be distinguished , as groups differ in terms of treatment approaches considered suitable as well as treatment response . Future trials should replicate previous findings and be multi-center trials with large sample sizes to allow for subgroup analyses . Patient assessment should include variables that can be considered relevant moderators of treatment outcome . It is desirable to explore  adaptive treatment strategies  for subgroups of patients with AN . Identifying and addressing maintaining factors in AN remains a major challenge."
" Overall , this review found low quality evidence that neither supported nor refuted the benefits of any specific WI for pain relief and moderate quality evidence that a multiple-component  intervention  reduced  sickness absence  in the intermediate-term , which was not sustained over time . Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate . There is an urgent need for high quality RCTs with well design ed WIs."
" The evidence available from r and omised controlled trials suggested that delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds beyond four days after birth did not reduce the risk of developing NEC in very preterm or VLBW infants , including growth-restricted infants . Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds result ed in a few days ' delay in  establishing full enteral feeds  but the clinical importance of this effect was unclear . The applicability of these findings to extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight was uncertain . Further r and omised controlled trials in this population may be warranted."
"hPURPOSE To summarize  measurement  instruments used to evaluate activity limitations and participation restrictions in  patients with chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS )  and review the psychometric properties of these instruments . METHOD General information of all included measurement instruments was extracted . The method ological quality was evaluated using the COSMIN checklist . Results of the measurement properties were rated based on the quality criteria of Terwee et al. Finally , overall quality was defined per psychometric property and measurement instrument by use of the quality criteria by Schellingerhout et al. RESULTS  A total of 68 articles were identified  of  which  eight evaluated the psychometric properties of a  measurement instrument assessing  activity  limitations and participation restrictions  .    One disease-specific  and 37 generic measurement instruments were found . Limited evidence was found for the  psychometric properties  and  clinical usability  of these instruments . However , the CFS-activities and participation  question naire  ( APQ ) is a disease-specific instrument with moderate content and construct validity .  The psychometric properties of the review ed measurement instruments to evaluate activity limitations and participation restrictions are not sufficiently evaluated . Future research is needed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measurement instruments , including the other properties of the CFS-APQ . If it is necessary to use a measurement instrument , the CFS-APQ is recommended . IMPLICATION S FOR REHABILITATION Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) . Chronic fatigue syndrome causes  activity limitations and participation restrictions  in one or more areas of life . St and ardized , reliable and valid measurement instruments are necessary to identify these limitations and restrictions . Currently , no measurement instrument is sufficiently evaluated with  persons with CFS .  If a measurement instrument is needed to identify  activity limitations and participation restrictions  with  persons  with CFS , it is recommended to use the CFS-APQ in clinical practice and scientific research."
"nTo the Editor : The same patient outcome data from  clinical  trial results , when presented as absolute or relative changes , may appear different in magnitude . Recommendations are to report both absolute and relative , or at least baseline , data from which to calculate absolute values [ 1 , 2 ] . A systematic review of efficacy trials demonstrated that only relative values were reported in most study abstract s ( 88 % ) and the main text ( 75 % ) [ 3 ] . To inform clinical practice , outcome improvements , whether relative or absolute , must be statistically significant and clinical ly meaningful . A minimal clinical ly important difference ( MCID ) should inform sample size calculations for clinical trials . Two main methods identify an MCID ( distribution and anchor-based methods ) ; ideally used together to interpret one in the context of the other [ 4 ] . The distribution method is a statistical calculation based on the baseline variability of the measure in the population studied . This gives an  effect size  ( change after intervention divided by st and ard deviation of baseline scores ) , the magnitude of which relates to a small , moderate or large clinical effect [ 5 ] . Thus the distribution method can only be used to calculate an  absolute MCID  as there is no st and ard deviation of baseline score for a relative measure . The anchor-based method relates the change in."
" Ezetimibe  monotherapy ( 10 mg/day ) showed a small ( 7.06 % ) but statistically significant reduction in  the plasma levels of Lp(a )  in  patients with primary hypercholesterolemia .  According to current literature , this magnitude of reduction seems to have no clinical relevance . However , further studies are warranted to clarify the mechanism mediating this effect  of ezetimibe  and to investigate its efficacy in combination with other drugs that have shown promise in lowering Lp(a ) levels."
"surgical  site  infections  (  SSIs ) continue to cause significant patient harm despite many advances in Sinfection prevention . The negative effects of SSIs on  morbidity , mortality , and the cost of care  has kept SSI reduction a top priority for health care organizations worldwide . A 2011 systematic review found that approximately 55 % of SSIs in the United States may be preventable by using evidence -based guidelines . Each SSI is associated with approximately 7 to 11 additional  postoperative hospital days  , and  patients  with an SSI have a 2 to 11 times higher  risk of death  compared with surgical  patients  without an SSI . In addition , 77 % of  deaths  in patients with SSIs are directly attributable to the SSI . From the patient ’s perspective , an  infection delays healing  , can  increase time away from work or family  , and can  cause additional pain and complications ( eg  ,  sepsis , long-term disabilities , death ) .   Evidence -based strategies to reduce   SSIs  have been available for years and must be implemented in more health care facilities."
"nBackground :  Stainless steel crowns ( SSCs )  are unique coronal restorative material s used commonly in the management of  primary teeth with extensive caries .  Aim : The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review to evaluate the  retentive strength  of  luting cements  for SSCs . Material s and Methods :  Two review ers  performed a data base search  of the studies published from 2004 till date . The inclusion criteria were papers published in the English language and in vitro studies on retentive strength of SSC on primary molars .  All potentially relevant studies were identified by the title and the abstract . After the full-text analysis , the selected studies were included in the systematic review . Results :  Sixteen nonduplicated studies were  found . However , after review ing the articles , only seven  were  included .  Risk bias  was assessed . Out of seven studies included in the systematic review , five studies presented medium  risk of  bias and two studies showed high  risk of bias .  Conclusion : Within the limitations of this study , thein vitro literature seems to suggest that the use of  self-adhesive resin cements  shows higher  retentive strength  , followed by  resin-modified glass-ionomer cement  ( RM-GIC ) and conventional GIC . However , RM-GIC can be a preferred luting agent due to its clinical advantages over resin cements . Thus , it can be concluded that choice of cement will depend on individual patient needs and clinical situation."
"nDifferent adipokines secreted from adipose tissue , exert a range of physiological effects . The aim of present systematic review and meta- analysis was to critically investigate the consequence of   bariatric  surgery  on circulating adipokines , that is ,  adiponectin , leptin , visfatin , resistin , plasminogen activator inhibitor  , and  chemerin  . After systematic ally checking the following electronic data bases : ISI web of Science , Scopus and PubMed without limitation in time and language up to February 2019 , a pool based on a r and om effect model was established .  Eighty-five eligible studies were entered for quantitative analysis  . Our meta- analysis revealed that  circulating adiponectin  increased significantly after  bariatric surgery  [ St and ardized mean difference (SMD)=1.401 , 95 % CI : 1.101 , 1.701 , p<0.001 ] ; whilst  leptin  ( SMD=-2.178 , 95 % CI : -2.433 , -1.923 , p<0.001 ) , PAI-1 ( -14.928 ng/ml 95 % CI : -21.794 , -8.063 , p<0.001 ) , and  chemerin  ( -50.238 ng/ml 95 % CI : -85.708 , -14.768 , p<0.001 ) decreased . However ,  serum visfatin  ( 2.05 ng/ml , 95 % CI : -5.07 , 9.17 , p=0.573 ) and  resistin  ( -2.080 ng/ml , 95 % CI : -5.352 , 1.192 , p=0.21 ) were unchanged . In conclusion ,  bariatric surgery  is associated with a reduction in  specific adipokines including leptin , chemerin , and PAI-1  , whereas adiponectin is raised , adaptations that could be indicative of improved  fat  mass and function."
" Our findings imply that studies of high method ological quality are needed to properly assess the measurement properties of the currently available question naires . Until high quality studies are available , we recommend using these question naires with caution . There is no need for the development of new neck-specific question naires until the current question naires have been adequately assessed."
"yPurpose The objective of this systematic review is to compare results concerning the properties of  adhesion , roughness , and hardness  of  dental liners obtained in the last ten years .  Methods Search es on the data bases LILACS , PubMed / Medline , Web of Science , and Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s were supplemented with manual search es conducted between February and April of 2018 . The inclusion criteria included experimental in vitro and in vivo , clinical , and laboratory studies on  resilient and /or hard liners  , assessment of hardness , roughness , and /or adhesion to the denture base , and physical/mechanical changes result ing from the disinfection process and changes in liners ' composition or application . Results  A total of 406 articles were identified and  , from  those  ,  44  are  discussed .  Twenty-four studies examined the  bond strength , 13 surface roughness , and 19 the hardness .  Of these 44 studies , 12 evaluated more than one property . Different substances were used in the attempt to improve  adhesion .  Considering roughness and hardness , the benefits of sealants have been tested , and the changes result ing from antimicrobial agents ' incorporation have been assessed . Conclusion  Adhesion  to the prosthesis base is improved with surface treatments . Rough surfaces and changes in  hardness  compromise the material 's serviceability."
 The  combination of PI and PDE5-Is  is a promising strategy for a favorable outcome in ED and can be considered as a first-choice option for  ED patients .  Stronger RCTs are required to confirm this initial finding.

"kThis review aims to assess by meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) changes in  pain and function  when  overweight patients with knee osteoarthritis ( OA )  achieve a  weight loss  . Systematic search es were performed and reference lists from the retrieved trials were search ed . RCTs were enclosed in the systematic review if they explicitly stated diagnosis of  knee OA  and reported a weight change as the only difference in intervention from the control group . Outcome  Measures for Arthritis Clinical Trials III  outcome variables were considered for analysis .  Effect size ( ES )  was calculated using RevMan , and meta-regression analyses were performed using weighted estimates from the r and om effects analyses .  Among 35 potential trials identified , four RCTs  including five intervention/control groups  met  our  inclusion criteria and provided data from 454 patients .   Pooled ES for pain and physical disability  were 0.20 ( 95 % CI 0 to 0.39 ) and 0.23 ( 0.04 to 0.42 ) at a weight reduction of 6.1 kg ( 4.7 to 7.6 kg ) . Meta-regression analysis showed that  disability  could be significantly improved when weight was reduced over 5.1 % , or at the rate of > 0.24 % reduction per week . Clinical efficacy on  pain reduction  was present , although not predictable after weight loss . Meta-regression analysis indicated that  physical disability  of  patients with knee OA and overweight  diminished after a moderate weight reduction regime . The analysis supported that a  weight loss  of > 5 % should be achieved within a 20-week period -- that is , 0.25 % per week."
"dTo systematic ally search for the availability of evidence for  exercise  impacting on  sleep  for  people who have rheumatoid arthritis .  Two review ers independently search ed  seven electronic data  bases , identified and extracted relevant studies by applying eligibility criteria . Sources of bias were assessed independently by two review ers using the Cochrane bias assessment tool for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and Newcastle – Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for non- RCTs . Data were synthesized using a level of evidence approach . Meta-analyses were deemed to be inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of study design s , measurement tools and interventions . Five studies were included : one RCT ; two pilot RCTs and two sample s of convenience .  A total of 262 people with RA were included .  Interventions used were difficult to assess due to the heterogeneity of study design s and the inclusion of two using different types of  yoga  as an intervention . Different  sleep outcome measures  were used thus , it was not feasible to pool results . Studies had a high risk of bias . This review could find no consistent or conclusive evidence on whether  exercise  impacts  on sleep  in  people who have rheumatoid arthritis  , therefore no firm conclusions can be made . However , there is some indication that  exercise  may have positive  benefits on sleep  in  people who have rheumatoid arthritis .  Further studies with improved study design s , using subjective and objective measures , are needed."
"dBACKGROUND Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of stroke . It is well known that lowering blood pressure decreases the risk of stroke in  people with  moderate  to  severe  hypertension .  However , the specific  effects  of  calcium channel blockers ( CCBs )  against stroke in  patients with hypertension  as compared to no treatment and other antihypertensive drug classes are not known . METHODS AND FINDINGS This systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluated  CCBs  effect on stroke in  patients with hypertension  in studies of  CCBs versus placebo , angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors ( ACEIs ) , β-adrenergic blockers , and diuretics .  The PUBMED , MEDLINE , EMBASE , OVID , CNKI , MEDCH , and WANFANG data bases were search ed for trials published in English  or  Chinese during the period January 1 , 1996 to July 31 , 2012 . A total  of 177 reports were collected  , among them  31 RCTs with 273,543 participants ( including 130,466 experimental subjects and 143,077 controls ) met the inclusion criteria .  In these trials a total of 9,550  stroke  events ( 4,145 in experimental group and 5,405 in control group ) were reported   . CCBs  significantly decreased the incidence of stroke  compared with  placebo  ( OR = 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.61 - 0.75 , p<1 × 10(-5 ) ) , β-adrenergic blockers combined with diuretics ( OR = 0.89 , 95 % CI 0.83 - 0.95 , p = 7 × 10(-5 ) ) and β-adrenergic blockers ( OR = 0.79 , 95 % CI 0.72 - 0.87 , p<1 × 10(-5 ) ) , statistically significant difference was not found  between CCBs  and ACEIs ( OR = 0.92 , 95 % CI 0.8 - 1.02 , p = 0.12 ) or diuretics ( OR = 0.95 , 95 % CI 0.84 - 1.07 , p = 0.39 ) .  In a pooled analysis of data of 31 RCTs measuring the effect  of CCBs   on stroke   , CCBs   reduced  stroke more  than placebo  and  β-adrenergic  blockers , but were not different  than ACEIs and diuretics  . More head to head RCTs are warranted."

 We observed statistically significantly better  AT recurrence-free survival  with  CPVA  than with  ADT .  These results highlight the need for larger trials to determine the appropriate role for  CPVA  in the management of AF . Ongoing clinical trials may provide further guidance on these treatment options for AF.
"nVitamin D deficiency is common and there exists a huge gap between recommended dietary  vitamin D  intakes and the poor  vitamin D  supply in the general population . While  vitamin D  is important for musculoskeletal health , there are accumulating data suggesting that  vitamin D  may also be important for fertility , pregnancy outcomes and lactation . Significant changes in  vitamin D  metabolism during pregnancy such as increased production of the "" active vitamin D hormone "" calcitriol support the important role of  vitamin D  in this setting . Observational studies show that  vitamin D  deficiency is a risk marker for reduced fertility and various adverse pregnancy outcomes and is associated with a low vitamin D content of breast milk . Meta-analyses of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) document that  physiological vitamin D supplementation  during pregnancy is safe and improves  vitamin D and calcium status  , thereby protecting  skeletal health .  Although certain RCTs and /or meta-analyses reported some other beneficial effects , it is still not clear whether  vitamin D supplementation   improves fertility or  decreases  the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes  such as  low birth weight , pre-eclampsia and neonatal mortality , or reduces wheeze/asthma  in the infants . Nevertheless ,  vitamin D supplementation  in  pregnant women  is frequently required to achieve a sufficient  vitamin D  status as recommended by nutritional vitamin D guidelines . In this review , we provide an overview of systematic review s , meta-analyses and large trials reporting clinical data on the role of  vitamin D  for fertility , pregnancy and lactation."
"nObjectives This meta- analysis aim ed to demonstrate the impact of  preoperative exercise therapy  on  surgical outcomes  in  patients with lung cancer and COPD .  Pulmonary function and muscle capacity were investigated to explore their potential links with outcome improvements after exercise . Methods Articles were search ed from PubMed , Embase , and the Cochrane Library with criteria of  lung cancer patients with or without COPD , undergoing  resection  , and receiving  preoperative exercise training .   Key outcomes were analyzed using meta- analysis . Results  Seven studies containing 404 participants were included .  Patients receiving  preoperative exercise training  had a lower  incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications ( PPCs ;  OR 0.44 , 95 % CI 0.27 - 0.71 ) and  shorter length of hospital stay  ( st and ardized mean difference -4.23 days , 95 % CI -6.14 to -2.32 days ) . Exceptionally ,  pneumonia incidence  remained unchanged .  Patients with COPD  could not obviously benefit from  exercise training  to reduce  PPCs  ( OR 0.44 , 95 % CI 0.18 - 1.08 ) , but still might achieve faster recovery .  No significant difference in pulmonary function  was observed between the two groups . However ,  6MWD and VO2 peak  were significantly improved after  exercise training .  Conclusion  Preoperative exercise training  may reduce  PPCs  for  lung cancer patients .  However , for  patients with COPD undergoing lung cancer resection  , the role of exercise is uncertain , due to limited data , which calls for more prospect i ve trials on this topic .  Rehabilitation exercise  strengthens muscle capacity , but does not improve  impaired pulmonary function  , which emphasizes the possible mechanism of the protocol design."
"tGastric cancer is the fifth malignancy and the third cause of cancer death worldwide , according to the global cancer statistics presented in 2018 . Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification , which took effect in 2018 . Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing . The cornerstone of GC treatment is  surgical  , in a context of  multimodal therapy .  Surgical treatment is being st and ardized , and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments . This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of  mini-invasive techniques  . Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view , with better  short-term outcomes  . The persecution of better  short-term  outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management , which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles . In the era of precision medicine , multimodal treatment is also evolving . The long-time-awaited results of many trials investigating the role for preoperative and postoperative management have been published , changing the clinical practice . Novel investigations focused both on  traditional chemotherapeutic regimens  and  targeted therapies  are currently ongoing . Modern platforms increase the possibility for further st and ardization of the different treatments , promote the use of big data and open new possibilities for surgical learning . This systematic review in two parts assesses all the current up date s in GC treatment."
"yAfter more than three decades of clinical trials testing various  st and ard-dose chemotherapy regimens  , the disease course of  patients with multiple myeloma  has not changed appreciably .  Conventional chemotherapy  can provide effective palliation but is not curative ( 1 ) . Case series have described encouraging results in  patients with myeloma undergoing allogeneic or autologous  bone marrow  or  peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation  (  2 ) . Other studies of transplantation , including r and omized trials , have been reported in the past 6 years ( 3 , 4 ) . To facilitate decisions about treatment options , practice guidelines have been developed for use by health care providers and consumers . In  Ontario  , Canada , cancer treatments and policies are led by a state-funded organization ,  Cancer Care Ontario .  To help derive treatment options , Cancer  Care Ontario  has developed the Program in  Evidence -Based Care  , which includes the Practice Guidelines Initiative . Disease Site Groups ( DSGs ) , which comprise physicians , epidemiologists , and consumers , develop guidelines through a systematic process that involves assessment of evidence , consensus , and a validation process involving practitioners from across  the province  . Guideline topics are chosen through a prioritization process that includes the burden of illness , availability of evidence , perceived variation in practice , the potential to affect treatment decisions , and re source utilization . The Hematology DSG noted that the use of transplantation for  patients with myeloma  varied among practice s across the province . Variability in practice and emerging evidence of higher quality made this a priority topic for guideline development . To approach this topic , the DSG addressed the following questions : What is  optimal st and ard-dose chemotherapy  for  patients with myeloma  ? In terms of survival , is   peripheral blood stem-cell   or   marrow  transplantation  better than  conventional chemotherapy  ? What is the  relative efficacy of autologous  versus  allogeneic transplantation  ? What specifics of  the transplantation process  can be recommended ? When should  transplantation  be  performed  ? Who should ( or should not ) receive a  transplant  ? Methods Overview of Guideline Development This guideline was developed by the Cancer Care Ontario Practice Guidelines Initiative ( CCOPGI ) using the methods of the Practice Guidelines Development Cycle ( 5 ) . Members of the  CCOPGI 's Hematology DSG  selected , review ed , and interpreted the evidence . This DSG comprises  25 members , including hematologists , medical and radiation oncologists , an epidemiologist , and 2 lay representatives .  Several of the  physician members  have background training in epidemiology ; 8  hematologists  regularly perform stem-cell transplantation in clinical practice . The DSG 's draft recommendations were circulated through a mailed survey to  hematologists and medical or radiation oncologists in Ontario  for feedback and involvement in a consensus process . Responses were used to guide the reformatting of the draft into the final guideline recommendations . The Practice Guidelines Co-ordinating Committee ( PGCC ) , which ensures consistency of guideline development across the  DSGs  of various  tumor sites  , approved the guideline . The CCOPGI has a st and ardized process to up date each guideline report ; the current guideline was up date d and review ed by the PGCC in October 2000 . Literature Search Strategy We search ed the  MEDLINE , CANCERLIT , and Cochrane Library data bases for literature published from 1992 to December 1997 and subsequently up date d the search in October 1998 , June 1999 , and April 2000 .  For the search es , we combined multiple myeloma ( as a Medical Subject Heading [ MeSH ] and text word ) with bone marrow transplantation ( MeSH and text word ) and  drug therapy  ( MeSH ) . Then , we combined these terms with the search terms for the following study design s : practice guidelines ; systematic review s or meta-analyses ; review s ; r and omized , controlled trials ; controlled clinical trials ; and comparative studies . In addition , we search ed the PubMed and Physician Data Query ( PDQ ) ( www.cancer.gov/ search / clinical _ trials/ ) data bases and review ed relevant conference proceedings ( American Society of Hematology , 1997 to 1999 , and American Society of Clinical Oncology , 1999 to 2000 ) , article bibliographies , and personal files . To address the issue of optimal chemotherapy , we performed an additional search of the same data bases using the term multiple myeloma ( MeSH ) combined with r and omized , controlled trials ( MeSH ) and the text word r and om in the title . Inclusion Criteria We selected study reports meeting one of the three following criteria : r and omized trial or meta- analysis of therapy for  patients with myeloma  that reported  survival or quality -of-life outcomes ;  nonr and omized comparative trial that addressed transplantation strategy , including a contemporaneous control group , and that reported  survival or quality -of-life outcomes ; or economic evaluation  that addressed  transplantation strategy  . Because of insufficient data on the specifics of the transplantation process and the patients who would be most likely to benefit from transplantation , we performed a second search , which identified data from noncomparative case-series studies . Data Extraction and Interpretative Summary Three members of the DSG , including an epidemiologist , determined eligibility of the articles and abstract s obtained from the literature search . The lead DSG member for this guideline extracted and summarized relevant data according to the guideline question addressed . The DSG members then review ed the summarized data and key articles . The DSG met formally three to four times annually ; at these meetings , the members method ologically assessed the articles , interpreted the data , and debated specific points in an attempt to reach a consensus . Synthesizing the Evidence Because all of the nine  r and omized trials  on  transplantation  addressed different questions , we did not statistically pool the data . DSG Consensus Process Through an iterative process that included debate at formal meetings and circulation of draft recommendations , we considered the implication s of the appraised data for each guideline question . With this process , attempts were made to reach consensus ; when this was impossible , minority opinions were recorded . Approval by each member of the DSG was required before circulation of the draft version for practitioner feedback and su bmi ssion of the final guideline to the PGCC . Practitioner Feedback To obtain practitioner feedback , we mailed a survey to  211 practitioners in Ontario ( 94 hematologists , 93 medical oncologists , and 24 radiation oncologists ) .  The survey consisted of st and ardized items asking the practitioner to rate the quality of each draft guideline and to judge whether the draft recommendations should serve as a practice guideline . Written comments were invited . Follow-up reminders were sent at 2 weeks ( by postcard ) and 4 weeks ( entire package ) . After exclusion of  18 retired practitioners  , 137 of  193 practitioners  ( 71 % ) responded  ;  90 of  137 respondents  ( 66 % ) indicated that the guideline was relevant to their practice . Approval of the draft guideline was strong among these 90 practitioners : 91 % agreed or strongly agreed that the  summary of the evidence  was acceptable , 87 % agreed with the draft recommendations , and 81 % approved of the recommendations as a practice guideline . Thirty-nine respondents provided written comments ; these comments were , like the other responses , incorporated in the final guideline . Results Sixty-six reports met the criteria for inclusion and are categorized in Table 1 . In each section below , we describe the studies , summarize results , and describe the guideline development . Table 1 . Evidence Included in This Practice Guideline Report What Is  Optimal St and ard-Dose  Chemotherapy   for Patients with Multiple Myeloma ? To properly compare transplantation with conventional chemotherapy , we must define optimal  conventional chemotherapy  . We identified 30 r and omized trials comparing therapies in previously untreated patients . Four meta-analyses ( 6 - 9 ) evaluated these data . The Myeloma Trialists ' Collaborative Group ( 7 ) compared  combination chemotherapy with melphalan plus prednisone  in a  meta-  analysis of  27 trials  . Twenty of these trials supplied individual-patient data . No difference  in survival  was detected . The proportional reduction in the annual odds  of death  was 1.5 % in favor of  combination chemotherapy  ( 95 % CI , 8 % to 5 % ; P > 0.2 ) , with an odds ratio ( OR ) of 0.99 ( CI , 0.93 to 1.05 ) . An earlier literature -based meta- analysis ( 6 ) of  18  trials also failed to detect a  survival difference  between groups ( OR , 1.04 [ CI , 0.90 to 1.19 ] ; P > 0.2 ) . Two meta-analyses evaluated  interferon  for multiple  myeloma .  An overview of  24 r and omized trials  published in abstract form ( 8) demonstrated that  interferon  improved  recurrence-free survival  by 6 months and improved  3-year overall survival  by 4 % . Another meta- analysis ( 9 ) measured  survival  by a unique measure called the  mean lifetime survival .  This meta- analysis found no difference  in survival rate  between the group receiving interferon and the group not receiving  interferon  ( 3.9 vs. 3.4 years , respectively ; P = 0.095 ) . Guideline Recommendation  Multiagent chemotherapy or melphalan plus prednisone  is appropriate therapy for a control group in a comparison of transplantation versus st and ard-dose therapy . The addition of  interferon  is unlikely to influence outcomes in the control group . In Terms of Survival , Is Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem-Cell or Bone Marrow Transplantation Better than Conventional Chemotherapy ? We review ed two r and omized and three nonr and omized comparisons ( Table 2 ) . Attal and colleagues ( 3 ) r and omly assigned  200 previously untreated patients younger than 65 years of age with stage II or III ( 40 ) myeloma  to conventional chemotherapy or to a strategy that included  autologous bone marrow transplantation .  Patients were r and omly."
" This review shows that physical frailty indicators can predict  ADL disability  in community-dwelling elderly people . Slow  gait speed  and  low physical activity/exercise  seem to be the most powerful predictors followed by  weight loss , lower extremity function , balance , muscle strength , and other indicators .  These findings should be interpreted with caution because the data of the different studies could not be pooled due to large variations in operationalization of the indicators and  ADL disability  across the included studies . Nevertheless , our study suggests that  monitoring physical frailty  indicators in community-dwelling elderly people might be useful to identify elderly people who could benefit from disability prevention programs."
"EAbstract Objective To review the evidence and provide recommendations on  antibiotic prophylaxis  for  gynaecologic procedures .  Outcomes Outcomes evaluated include  need and effectiveness of  antibiotics  to prevent infections  in  gynaecologic procedures .  Evidence Medline and The Cochrane Library were search ed for  articles published between January 1978 and January 2011 on the topic of antibiotic prophylaxis in gynaecologic procedures .  Results were restricted to systematic review s , r and omized control trials/ controlled clinical trials , and observational studies . Search es were up date d on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2011  .  Grey ( unpublished ) literature was identified through search ing the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment -related agencies , clinical practice guideline collection s , clinical trial registries , and national and international medical specialty societies . Values The quality of evidence obtained was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care ( Table 1 ) . Benefits  , harms  , and costs Guideline implementation should result in a reduction of  cost  and  related harm  of administering antibiotics when not required and a reduction of  infection and related morbidities  when antibiotics have demonstrated a proven benefit . Recommendations 1 . All  women undergoing an abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy  should receive  antibiotic prophylaxis  . ( I-A ) 2 . All  women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy  should receive  prophylactic antibiotics  . ( III-B ) 3 . The choice of antibiotic for hysterectomy should be a single dose of a  first-generation cephalosporin .  If patients are allergic to cephalosporin , then  clindamycin , erythromycin  , or  metronidazole  should be used . ( I-A ) 4 .  Prophylactic antibiotics  should be administered 15 to 60 minutes prior to skin incision . No additional doses are recommended . ( I-A ) 5 . If an open abdominal procedure is lengthy ( e.g. , > 3 hours ) , or if the estimated  blood loss  is > 1500 mL , an additional dose of the prophylactic  antibiotic  may be given 3 to 4 hours after the initial dose . ( III-C ) 6 . Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for laparoscopic procedures that involve no direct access from the abdominal cavity to the uterine cavity or vagina . ( l-E ) 7 . All  women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and /or stress urinary incontinence  should receive a single dose of firstgeneration  cephalosporin .  ( III-B ) 8 . Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for hysteroscopic surgery . ( II-2D ) 9 . All women undergoing an induced ( therapeutic ) surgical abortion should receive  prophylactic antibiotics  to reduce the  risk of postabortal infection .  ( I-A ) 10 .  Prophylactic antibiotics  are not suggested to reduce  infectious morbidity  following surgery for a missed or incomplete abortion . ( I-E ) 11 .  Antibiotic  prophylaxis is not recommended for insertion of an intrauterine device . ( I-E ) However , health care professionals could consider screening for sexually transmitted infections in  high-risk  population s. ( III-C ) 12 . There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for an endometrial biopsy . ( III-L ) 13 . The best method to prevent infection after hysterosalpingography is unknown .  Women with dilated tubes found at the time of hysterosalpingography  are at highest risk , and  prophylactic antibiotics (  e.g. ,  doxycycline )  should be given . ( II-3B ) 14 .  Antibiotic prophylaxis  is not recommended for urodynamic studies in women at low risk , unless the incidence of  urinary tract infection post-urodynamics  is > 10 % . ( 1-E ) 15 . In  patients with morbid obesity ( BMI > 35 kg/m2 )  , doubling the antibiotic dose may be considered . ( III-B ) 16 Administration of  antibiotics  solely to prevent endocarditis is not recommended for  patients who undergo a genitourinary procedure .  ( III-E."
"yBACKGROUND Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of  disability .  Nonsurgical treatment is a key first step . PURPOSE Systematic literature review of  physical therapy ( PT ) interventions  for  community-dwelling adults with knee osteoarthritis .  DATA SOURCES MEDLINE , the Cochrane Library , the Physiotherapy Evidence Data base , Scirus , Allied and Complementary Medicine , and the Health and Psychosocial Instruments bibliography data base . STUDY SELECTION  193 r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) published in English from 1970 to 29 February 2012 .  DATA EXTRACTION Means of outcomes , PT interventions , and risk of bias were extracted to pool st and ardized mean differences . Disagreements between review ers abstract ing and checking data were resolved through discussion . DATA SYNTHESIS Meta-analyses of  84  RCTs provided evidence for 13  PT interventions   on pain  ( 58 RCTs )  , physical function  ( 36 RCTs )  , and disability  ( 29 RCTs ) . Meta-analyses provided low-strength evidence that  aerobic  ( 11 RCTs ) and  aquatic  ( 3 RCTs ) exercise  improved disability  and that  aerobic exercise  ( 19 RCTs ) ,  strengthening exercise  ( 17 RCTs ) , and  ultrasonography  ( 6 RCTs )  reduced pain and improved function .  Several individual RCTs demonstrated clinical ly important  improvements  in  pain and disability  with  aerobic exercise  . Other  PT  interventions demonstrated no sustained  benefit  . Individual RCTs showed similar benefits with  aerobic , aquatic , and strengthening exercise .  Adverse events were uncommon and did not deter participants from continuing treatment . LIMITATION Variability in  PT  interventions and outcomes measures hampered synthesis of evidence .  Low-strength evidence suggested that only a few  PT interventions  were effective . Future studies should compare  combined PT interventions  ( which is how  PT  is generally administered for pain associated with knee osteoarthritis ) .

"tGastric cancer ( GC ) is the fifth malignancy and the third cause of cancer death worldwide , according to the global cancer statistics presented in 2018 . Its definition and staging have been revised in the eight edition of the AJCC/TNM classification , which took effect in 2018 . Novel molecular classifications for GC have been recently established and the process of translating these classifications into clinical practice is ongoing . The cornerstone of GC treatment is  surgical  , in a context of  multimodal therapy .  Surgical treatment is being st and ardized , and is evolving according to new anatomical concepts and to the recent technological developments . This is leading to a massive improvement in the use of mini-invasive  techniques  . Mini-invasive techniques aim to be equivalent to open surgery from an oncologic point of view , with better  short-term outcomes  . The persecution of better  short-term  outcomes also includes the optimization of the perioperative management , which is being implemented on large scale according to the enhanced recovery after surgery principles . In the era of precision medicine , multimodal treatment is also evolving . The long-time-awaited results of many trials investigating the role for preoperative and postoperative management have been published , changing the clinical practice . Novel investigations focused both on traditional  chemotherapeutic  regimens and targeted  therapies  are currently ongoing . Modern platforms increase the possibility for further st and ardization of the different treatments , promote the use of big data , and open new possibilities for surgical learning . This systematic review in two parts assesses all the current up date s in GC treatment."
"eThe presence of residues within the  root canal  after post-space preparation can influence the bond strength between resin cement and root dentin when using  fiberglass posts ( FGPs ) .  Currently , there is no consensus in the literature regarding what is the best solution for the removal of debris after post-space preparation . This systematic review involved "" in vitro "" studies to investigate if  cleaning methods of the  root canal  after  post-space  preparation  can increase the  retention of FGPs  evaluated by the push-out test . Search es were carried out in PubMed ( MEDLINE ) and Scopus data bases up to July2017 .  English language studies published from 2007 to July 2017 were selected . 475 studies were found , and 9 were included in this review .  Information from the 9 studies were collected regarding the number of sample s , storage method after extraction , root canal preparation , method of post-space preparation , endodontic sealer , resin cement , cleaning methods after post-space and presence of irrigant activation . Five studies presented the best results for the association of  sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl ) and ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ( EDTA )  , while in the other 4 studies , the solutions that showed improved  retention of FGPs  were photon-induced photoacoustic streaming ( PIPS ) , Qmix , Sikko and EDTA . The results showed heterogeneity in all comparisons due to a high variety of information about cleaning methods , different concentrations , application time , type of adhesive system and resin cements used . In conclusion , this review suggests that the use of  NaOCl/EDTA  results in the  retention of FGPs  and may thus be recommended as a post-space cleaning method influencing the luting procedure."

"sOBJECTIVE  Home telemonitoring  represents a patient management approach combining various information technologies for monitoring  patients  at distance . This study presents a systematic review of the nature and magnitude of outcomes associated with  telemonitoring  of  four types of chronic illnesses : pulmonary conditions , diabetes , hypertension , and cardiovascular diseases .  METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted on Medline and the Cochrane Library to identify  relevant articles published between 1990 and 2006 .  A  total  of  65 empirical studies were obtained ( 18 pulmonary conditions , 17 diabetes , 16 cardiac diseases , 14 hypertension ) mostly conducted in the United States and Europe .  RESULTS The magnitude and significance of the telemonitoring effects on patients ' conditions ( e.g. ,  early detection of symptoms , decrease in blood pressure , adequate medication , reduced mortality )  still remain inconclusive for all four chronic illnesses . However , the results of this study suggest that regardless of their nationality , socioeconomic status , or age , patients comply with  telemonitoring  programs and the use of technologies . Importantly , the telemonitoring effects on  clinical effectiveness outcomes  ( e.g. ,  decrease in the emergency visits , hospital admissions , average hospital length of stay )  are more consistent in pulmonary and cardiac studies than diabetes and hypertension . Lastly ,  economic viability  of telemonitoring was observed in very few studies and , in most cases , no in-depth cost-minimization analyses were performed .   Home telemonitoring  of chronic diseases seems to be a promising patient management approach that produces accurate and reliable data , empowers patients , influences their attitudes and behaviors , and potentially improves their medical conditions . Future studies need to build evidence related to its clinical effects , cost effectiveness , impacts on services utilization , and acceptance by health care providers."
"nThe evidence on the association between  baseline vitamin D  status and risk of   incident hypertension  in general population s  is limited and has not been reliably quantified . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of published prospect i ve studies evaluating the associations of baseline  vitamin D  status  ( circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ] levels and dietary vitamin D intake )  with risk of   hypertension   . Eligible studies were identified in a literature search  of MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Web of Science up to November 2012 .   Pooled relative risks ( RRs )  with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using r and om effects models . Generalized least-squares trend estimation was used to assess dose – response relationships .  Of the 2,432 articles review ed for eligibility , eight unique prospect i ve cohorts with aggregate data on 283,537 non-overlapping participants and 55,816 incident hypertension cases were included .  The RRs ( 95 % CIs ) for  hypertension  in a comparison of extreme thirds of baseline levels of  vitamin  D were 0.70 ( 0.58 , 0.86 ) for seven studies that measured  blood 25(OH ) D levels  and 1.00 ( 0.95 , 1.05 ) for four studies that assessed dietary vitamin D intake . The  pooled RR of incident hypertension  per 10 ng/mL increment in  baseline 25(OH)D levels  was 0.88 ( 0.81 , 0.97 ) in dose – response analysis . Evidence was lacking of heterogeneity among studies that measured  blood 25(OH ) D levels  and those that assessed dietary vitamin D status . Studies are needed to determine whether the association of  vitamin D  with hypertension represents a causal association and also to determine whether  vitamin D therapy  may be beneficial in the prevention or the treatment of hypertension."
" Overall , the evidence base for treating  PBS/IC  using intravesical preparations is limited and the potential for meta- analysis reduced by variation in the outcome measures used . The quality of trial reports was mixed and in some cases this precluded any meaningful data extraction .  BCG and oxybutin  are reasonably  well-tolerated  and evidence is most promising for these . Resiniferatoxin showed no evidence of effect for most outcomes and caused  pain  , which reduced treatment compliance . There is little evidence for the other treatments included in this review . R and omised controlled trials are still needed and study design should incorporate outcomes that are most relevant to these with PBS/IC and should be st and ardised."

"dHighlightsImpulsive  aggression  and dysfunctional response inhibition are present in  ADHD and DBDs .  Broad fronto‐striatal‐cerebellar dysfunctions have been implicated in ADHD and DBDs . Prefrontal and cingulate cortical deficits are associated with IA in ADHD.Severe widespread cortico‐subcortical breakdowns are associated with IA in DBDs . RI deficits have been attributed to hypoactivity in the lateral PFC , insula , and amygdala . Whether reduced gray matter volumes relate to ADHD and DBDs or if present as an IA epiphenomenon remains debatable . Background : Although impulsive aggression ( IA ) and dysfunctional  response inhibition  ( RI ) are hallmarks of attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and disrupted behavioral disorders ( DBDs ) , little is known about their shared and distinct deviant neural mechanisms . Aims and Methods : Here , we selectively review  ed s/fMRI  ADHD   and DBD studies to identify disorder‐specific and shared IA and RI aberrant neural mechanisms . Results : In ADHD , deviant prefrontal and cingulate functional activity was associated with increased IA  . Structural alterations  were most pronounced in the cingulate cortex .  Subjects with DBDs  showed marked cortico‐subcortical dysfunctions . ADHD and DBDs share similar cortico‐limbic structural and functional alterations .  RI deficits  in ADHD highlighted  hypoactivity  in the dorso/ventro‐lateral PFC , insula , and striatum , while the paralimbic system was primarily dysfunctional in DBDs . Across disorders , extensively altered cortico‐limbic dysfunctions underlie IA ,  while RI  was mostly associated with aberrant prefrontal activity . Conclusion : Control network deficits were evidence d across clinical phenotypes in  IA  and  RI  . Dysfunctions at any level within these cortico‐subcortical projections lead to  deficient cognitive‐affective control  by ascribing emotional salience to otherwise irrelevant stimuli . The clinical implication s of these findings are discussed."
"gHighlightsCognitive  deficits  are present in up to 70 % of  people with multiple sclerosis (MS).There  are no approved treatments for these difficulties . We examined whether adjunctive  pharmacotherapies  can improve cognition in MS.Acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors  offered no significant benefits over  placebo . Stimulant‐based medications  offered no significant benefits over  placebo .  & NA ; We sought to examine the effectiveness of  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEIs )  and  stimulant‐based medications  for improving  cognitive performance  in  patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .  An electronic data base search was conducted on 25th March 2017 . Eligible studies were double‐blind ,  r and omised  ,  placebo‐controlled  trials that examined the efficacy of compounds that act primarily as  AChEIs  or  stimulants  ( administered daily for ≥1 week ) on  cognitive  outcome measures in  patients with MS .  Where suitable data was reported , we generated effect sizes and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals and performed meta‐analyses using r and om‐effects models to investigate the effectiveness of these drug types across cognitive domains .  Sixteen trials  were included in the systematic review , with  eleven trials ( N = 734 MS patients )  providing sufficient data for meta‐ analysis . Whilst there was only a limited pool of relatively small trials and a number of different compounds , we found that collectively , both AChEIs  (  donepezil and rivastigmine  )  and stimulants  ( methylpheni date , modafinil , l‐amphetamine sulfate and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate )  offered no significant benefits  over  placebo on measures of processing speed , working memory , verbal fluency , verbal memory , visuospatial memory or executive functioning."
" This systematic review suggests a benefit of  individual education  on glycaemic  control  when compared with  usual care  in a subgroup of those with a baseline HbA1c greater than  8  % . However , overall there did not appear to be a significant difference between  individual education  and  usual care .  In the small number of studies comparing group and individual education , there was an equal impact on HbA1c at 12 to 18 months . Additional studies are needed to delineate these findings further."
"nProponents of evidence -based medicine ( EBM ) emphasize that conclusions about medical interventions should be based on controlled trials with clinical ly relevant outcomes , so that the greatest weight should be given to the systematic review s of the trials . One of the most comprehensive EBM data bases is the Cochrane Library , which contains thous and s of systematic review s on medical interventions . The Cochrane review on   vitamin  C  and the  common cold analyzed 29 trial comparisons on the preventive effects of  vitamin C  , 29 comparisons on the effect of  regular vitamin C  on common cold duration and severity , and 7 comparisons on the therapeutic effect of  vitamin C.   The review concludes : ‘ ‘ Implication s for practice : The prophylaxis trials found a reduction in  common cold duration  of 8 % in adults and 13 % in children . . . . So far , therapeutic supplementation has not been shown to be effective . Nevertheless , given the consistent effect of  vitamin C  on duration and severity in the regular supplementation studies , and the low cost and safety , it may be worthwhile for  common cold patients  to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic  vitamin C  is beneficial for them . ’ ’ In their review discussing the effect of  dietary supplements  on the common cold , Mathes and Bellanger refer to  9 papers  and state that ‘ ‘ various trials have shown no difference in  either duration , or severity of symptoms  , when  vitamin C  was compared to  placebo .  In addition , numerous trials have shown no difference regarding the most commonly studied endpoint :  frequency of symptoms .  ’ ’ Since the conclusions of the Cochrane review diverge considerably from the conclusions of Mathes and Bellanger , it is useful to look at the findings of the studies they refer to . Some of the findings are inconsistent with their statements . Pitt and Costrini found statistically significant ( P[2-tail]1⁄4 .024 ) yet small reduction  in common cold severity  among  US Marines who were administered  2 g/day  vitamin C.  Van Straten and Joslin reported a highly significant reduction in the  number of participants who had 2 colds  during their trial ( 2/84 vs 16/84 ; P 1⁄4 .0004 ) by 1 g/day  vitamin C.  Ludvigsson et al found a 14 % reduction ( P 1⁄4 .016 ) in  the duration of ‘ ‘ absence from school because of upper respiratory tract infection ’ ’  in their main trial , and a 39 % reduction ( P 1⁄4 .004 ) in the  duration of ‘ ‘ upper respiratory tract infection ’ ’  in their smaller trial when  schoolchildren  were administered 1 g/day of  vitamin C.  Terrence And erson carried out 3   vitamin C  trials in Canada  in the  1970s .  In their first trial , And erson et al administered 1  g/day vitamin C regularly  and 3 g/day extra when a participant caught the common cold . They found a 30 % ( P 1⁄4 .01 ) decrease in  the number of days confined indoors  in the  vitamin C  group . Furthermore ,  staying free of illness  during the study period is also a relevant measure of effect and And erson et al found 8 percentage point increase in the proportion of  participants  who  were ‘ ‘ not ill during the trial  , ’ ’ ‘ ‘ not  confined  to the house , ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ not off work ’ ’ in the  vitamin C  group ( P 1⁄4 .01 ) . In their second trial , And erson et al were ambitious and they had 2  placebo  arms and 6  vitamin C  arms with different dosages . There were technical problems such as the mislabeling of bottles of tablets , and therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn from the second trial . Nevertheless , in the  vitamin C  arm which was administered 8 g of  vitamin C  only on the first day , 6.6 percentage points ( P 1⁄4 .046 ) more participants  had colds lasting for only 1 day  , compared with the arm administered 4 g of  vitamin C  , which suggests dose dependency . In their third trial , And erson et al administered 1 to 1.5  g/day of vitamin C therapeutically  so that  supplementation  was initiated when a person caught a cold . They found a  reduction in ‘ ‘ days spent indoors per subject ’ ’  by 25 % ( P 1⁄4 .048 ) among the  vitamin C  participants . These 7 controlled trials described above do not support Mathes and Bellanger ’s statements although the studies are provided as references . Furthermore , Mathes and Bellanger do not describe their rationalization to select the 9 references out of several dozens . In systematic review s , it is important to describe the selection criteria , in order to prevent bias caused by selecting studies that are consistent with the review ers ’ preconceptions . If Mathes and Bellanger were not ready to carry out their own systematic review , they should have taken a look at the Cochrane review which used explicit selection criteria and included all studies fulfilling those criteria . The main findings of the Cochrane review are as follows . In  5 trials with participants under heavy acute physical stress ( 3 with marathon runners )   , vitamin C   reduced the incidence of colds  by 52 % ( 95 % CI : 36 % to 65 % ) , but there is no evidence that  vitamin C  prevents  colds  in the general  population  .

"sThere is no consensus on the most effective operation for  primary Dupuytren ’s contracture .  This systematic review evaluates the reported rates of recurrence and complications , as well as the strength of evidence , for individual procedures . The PubMed and EMBASE data bases were search ed for  papers in English containing ‘ Dupuytren ’ in the citation .  The initial  search produced 2155 references , of which 69 papers met the study inclusion criteria .  There was wide disparity in  scoring systems , definition of recurrence  and  recording of complications .  Follow-up ranged from 3 weeks to 13 years , and  recurrence  from 0 to 71 % . There are only three Level I studies comparing  surgical techniques  for the treatment of  primary Dupuytren ’s contracture  , and the evidence does not support one procedure above another , other than to show a particularly high  recurrence rate  after  needle fasciotomy .  We propose a minimum data set for future studies."
"9Atrial   fibrillation  ( AF )  is the most common arrhythmia in the  elderly  , currently affecting more than 2.7 million Americans ( 1 ) , with a projected prevalence of 5.6 to 12.1 million by 2050 ( 2 , 3 ) .  Patients with AF  have not only a 4- to 5-fold increase in the  risk for stroke  ( 4 ) but also larger  brain infa rct ions  and  worse poststroke outcomes  than patients without AF ( 57 ) . A recent meta- analysis demonstrated that AF is associated with a 40 % increase in the  risk for cognitive impairment  ( relative risk [ RR ] , 1.40 [ 95 % CI , 1.19 to 1.64 ] ) ( 8) . This association was independent of a history of  symptomatic stroke  ( RR , 1.34 [ CI , 1.13 to 1.58 ] ) ( 8) and other comorbid conditions , such as advanced age , hypertension , heart failure , and diabetes ( 9 , 10 ) . These findings highlight the elusiveness of the mechanisms underlying this association and suggest pathways other than  symptomatic  stroke and shared risk factors listed previously as the underlying cause of this association . One such mechanism may be  silent cerebral infa rct ions ( SCIs ) .  Several studies showed a significant association  between AF  and  SCIs  in  patients without  a history  of  clinical ly overt stroke ( 11 , 12 ) ; however , the few studies that attempted to reproduce similar results did not demonstrate an association ( 13 , 14 ) . There is a significant variability in the reported prevalence of  SCIs  in  patients with AF  ( 11 , 12 ) . One source of this heterogeneity may lie in the different methods of diagnosing  SCIs .  Whereas earlier studies used  autopsy  ( 15 , 16 ) or  computed tomography  ( CT ) scans ( 1719 ) to identify  SCIs  , recent studies have used  magnetic resonance imaging  (  MRI  ) ( 12 , 13 ) , a more sensitive method , to detect such lesions . It is critical to underst and the association between  AF and SCIs  , not only because it may be a mediating factor in the link between  AF  and  cognitive impairment  but also because  SCIs  may predict  future symptomatic strokes and death  ( 2023 ) . No study has attempted to gather all of the available data in the literature on the association between  AF and SCIs  and on the prevalence  of SCIs  in  patients with AF .  Therefore , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of the literature to estimate the association  between AF and SCIs  and the prevalence  of SCIs   in patients with AF and no history of symptomatic stroke .  Methods An internal study protocol was developed at the  Cardiac Arrhythmia Service ( Boston , Massachusetts )  to perform this review ; the protocol was not registered in any data base . Data Sources Five leading bibliographic data bases of biomedical science ( MEDLINE [ Ovid interface ] , PsycINFO , Cochrane Library [ Ovid SP ] , CINAHL , and EMBASE ) were search ed electronically from their  inception  to  8 May 2014  , using text and explosion of medical subject headings ( Supplement ) . One of the investigators design ed the search strategies with the help of a trained librarian . In addition , bibliographies of pertinent articles as well as review papers were manually search ed . No language restriction was applied . Authors of the included studies were contacted when required data were missing or ambiguous . Supplement . Literature Search Through 8 May 2014 Study Selection Prospect i ve and non prospect i ve studies reporting the prevalence or  incidence of SCIs  in  patients with AF  , as well as prospect i ve and non prospect i ve studies in which a risk estimate for the association between AF and SCIs was reported or could be calculated , were included in this meta- analysis . Magnetic resonance imaging studies were only included if they acknowledged the exclusion of leukoaraiosis from their analyses , used diffusion-weighted images , or used either hypodensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images or prominent hypodensity on T1-weighted images as an additional criterion to separate leukoaraiosis from SCIs . Exclusion criteria included inappropriate study design ( such as review s , editorials , letters , case series , case reports , and conference proceedings ) ;  studies  evaluating  SCIs  after a procedure , such as  catheter ablation  ,  coronary artery bypass graft surgery  , or cardioversion , in  patients with AF ; studies  with conflicting and inconsistent data in which discrepancies between text and tables could not be resolved by contacting authors or consensus  ; studies of patients with prosthetic heart valves ; studies restricted to patients with mitral stenosis or rheumatic valve disease ; studies  using  transcranial Doppler sonography  or  electroencephalography  for diagnosis of SCIs ; and  studies of patients with acute  stroke  or a history of symptomatic stroke .  Data Extraction Following MOOSE ( Meta- analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ) guidelines ( 24 ) , studies were initially screened on the basis of titles and abstract s. The full texts of potentially relevant papers were later review ed . The reference lists of the review papers and studies that met the inclusion criteria were manually search ed . Data from individual studies were extracted by 2 independent observers . Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or a third review er . The data extraction sheet included the first author ; year ; study design ( prospect i ve vs. non prospect i ve ) ; study setting and comparison groups ; follow-up period ( when applicable ) ; population characteristics ( age ; sex ; country ; comorbid conditions , particularly history of symptomatic stroke ; and medication , particularly anticoagulants ) ; inclusion and exclusion criteria ;  AF type ( paroxysmal vs. persistent  ) ; and methods of AF ascertainment (  electrocardiography  vs.  others )  . The data extraction sheet also included the method of outcome ascertainment  ( CT , MRI , or autopsy ) ; CT , MRI , or autopsy  specifications ( such as section thickness or number and thickness of gaps between the slices ) ;  categories  of  SCI size ; definition of SCI ; total  sample size  ; number of  patients with and without AF  ; number of  patients with SCIs  within each group ;   type of RR estimate ( odds ratio [ OR ] , risk ratio , or hazard ratio )  ; point estimate and  95  %  CI  ; list of variables in the multivariate model ; and level of adjustment . We considered adjustment for confounding either at the study design stage ( such as restriction and matching ) or at the analyses stage ( such as stratification or multivariate analyses ) to be acceptable . Studies that used an acceptable method to control for at least 5 of the following 6 variables were considered to be at minimal risk of confounding bias : age , sex , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus , and significant carotid stenosis . Studies that did not control for 2 or more of these variables were considered at moderate risk of confounding bias , and those with no adjustment for any of the variables were considered at high risk of confounding bias and were excluded from analysis of pooled OR . Quality Assessment Because there are no st and ard criteria to assess the quality of observational studies , we used an adaptation of 2 published checklists ( 25 , 26 ) and criteria that were applicable and relevant to the eligible studies . Risk for misclassification of AF and SCIs , as well as risk of confounding and selection bias , were assessed using 15 questions ( Appendix Table 1 ) . Not all of the quality criteria were applicable to each study ; therefore , to make valid comparisons among studies , we used the ratio of estimated quality score to maximum possible score ( Appendix Table 2 ) . The total score was calculated and a sensitivity analysis was performed , including only studies that met at least 70 % of the total possible quality score . Appendix Table 1 . Fifteen Questions to Assess the Quality of Included Studies Appendix Table 2 . Assessing the Quality of Included Studies Using 15 Criteria Data Synthesis and Analysis Silent cerebral infa rct ions were broadly defined as evidence of brain infa rct ions on imaging or autopsy with no attributable clinical symptoms ( such as neurologic deficits ) . When possible , SCIs were stratified according to their location as cortical versus noncortical . Cortical infa rct ions were defined as infa rct ions in the cerebral cortex with or without extension into the subcortical white matter . In the presence of heterogeneity , we used r and om-effects models and the profile likelihood method ( 27 ) to perform the meta- analysis of the association between AF and SCIs . In the absence of heterogeneity , results from fixed-effects models were reported . Forest plots were used to display and summarize the  association between AF and SCIs  according to SCI diagnosis methods . The Q statistic was used to test for  heterogeneity  . The degree of heterogeneity was quantified by I 2 statistics with an I 2 value of 30 % to 60 % representing a moderate level of heterogeneity ( 28 ) . We estimated the  prevalence of SCIs  in patients with AF for each study using binomial distribution . The PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS , version 9.1 , was used to estimate  pooled prevalence of SCIs  in  patients with AF  according to the method of SCI diagnosis . PROC GLIMMIX is able to fit generalized linear mixed models to correlated data with nonconstant variability where the response is not necessarily normally distributed ( response distribution for the prevalence was specified as binomial ) . Stata/IC , version 12 , was used to perform the remainder of the analyses . The significance level was defined as a P value less than 0.05 for all analyses . Role of the Funding Source This review was funded by the Deane Institute for Integrative Research in Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke , Massachusetts General Hospital . The funding source had no role in the design or conduct of the study ; collection or analysis of the data ; or the decision to su bmi t the manuscript for publication . Results  Of 1723 titles and abstract s , 105 papers met the criteria for full-text screening . One German ( 29 ) and 2 Japanese ( 30 , 31 ) articles  were translated into  English . Sixteen  papers from the electronic search and 1 from the manual search met the inclusion criteria ( Appendix Figure ) . The  prevalence of SCIs  was extracted or calculated from 17 studies ( 9."
"rClinical practice guidelines state that the tissue source of  low back  pain can not be specified in the majority of patients . However , there has been no systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic tests used to identify the source of low back pain . The aim of this systematic review was therefore to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests available to clinicians to identify the disc , facet joint or sacroiliac joint ( SIJ ) as the source of low back pain . MEDLINE , EMBASE and CINAHL were search ed up to February 2006 with citation tracking of eligible studies . Eligible studies compared index tests with an appropriate reference test  ( discography , facet joint or SIJ blocks or medial branch blocks )  in  patients with low back pain .  Positive likelihood ratios ( + LR ) > 2 or negative likelihood ratios ( -LR ) < 0.5 were considered informative .  Forty-one studies of moderate quality were included ; 28 investigated the disc , 8 the facet joint and 7 the SIJ .  Various features observed on  MRI  ( high intensity zone , endplate changes and disc degeneration ) produced  informative  + LR ( > 2 ) in the majority of studies increasing the probability of the disc being the low back pain source . However , heterogeneity of the data prevented pooling . + LR ranged from 1.5 to 5.9 , 1.6 to 4.0 , and 0.6 to 5.9 for high intensity zone , disc degeneration and endplate changes , respectively . Central isation was the only clinical feature found to increase the  likelihood  of  the  disc as the  source of pain  : + LR = 2.8 ( 95%CI 1.4–5.3 ) .  Absence of degeneration on MRI  was the only test found to reduce the likelihood of the disc as the  source of pain  : −LR = 0.21 ( 95%CI 0.12–0.35 ) . While single manual tests of the SIJ were uninformative , their use in combination was informative with + LR of 3.2 ( 95%CI 2.3–4.4 ) and −LR of 0.29 ( 95%CI 0.12–0.35 ) . None of the tests for  facet joint pain  were found to be informative . The results of this review demonstrate that tests do exist that change  the probability of the disc or SIJ  ( but not  the facet joint  ) as the source  of low back pain  . However , the changes in probability are usually small and at best moderate . The usefulness of these tests in clinical practice , particularly for guiding treatment selection , remains unclear."

">OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized ,  placebo-controlled  trials to assess the effect of  vitamin K supplementation  on  insulin sensitivity .  DATA SOURCES MEDLINE , the Cochrane Library , CINAHL , Web of Science , Scopus , clinical trials.gov , and clinical trial results .org were search ed up to January 2017 . Reference lists of related papers were also scanned . STUDY SELECTION R and omized controlled trials were selected if they compared  vitamin K supplementation with placebo or no treatment  and reported  homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin , C-reactive protein , adiponectin , leptin , or interleukin-6 levels  . DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction and study quality assessment were performed independently by two investigators using a st and ardized data extraction form . Any inconsistencies were resolved by a third review er . Effect estimates were pooled using inverse-variance weighted method . Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 and Q statistic . RESULTS  A total of eight trials involving 1,077 participants met  the inclusion criteria .  A wide variety of participants were enrolled , including older men , postmenopausal women , prediabetic premenopausal women , and participants with a history of diabetes , hypertension , or vascular disease .   Vitamin K1 and vitamin K2  ( MK-4 and MK-7 subtypes ) were assessed . Supplementation period ranged from 4 weeks to 3 years .  Vitamin K supplementation  did not affect  insulin sensitivity  as measured by homeostasis model assessment  of insulin resistance , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin , C-reactive protein , adiponectin , leptin , and interleukin-6 levels  .  Our analysis suggests no effect of  vitamin K supplementation  on  insulin sensitivity ."

High- quality controlled studies measuring relevant long-term outcomes are needed to address which biomarker is the most appropriate for assessing iodine intake in some  population groups and setting ."
"sThe number of  people with diabetes and pre-diabetes  are exponentially increasing . Studies on humans have shown the beneficial effects of  Zinc supplementation  in  patients with diabetes .  The present study aims to systematic ally evaluate the literature and meta-analyze the effects of  Zinc supplementation  on diabetes . A systematic review of published studies reporting the effects of  Zinc supplementations  on diabetes mellitus was undertaken . The literature search was conducted in the following data bases ; PubMed , Web of Science and SciVerse Scopus . A meta- analysis of studies examining the effects of  Zinc supplementation  on clinical and biochemical parameters in  patients with diabetes  was performed . The  total number of articles included in the present review is 25 , which included 3 studies on type-1 diabetes and 22 studies on type-2 diabetes .  There were 12 studies comparing the effects of  Zinc supplementation  on  fasting blood glucose  in  patients with type-2 diabetes .  The pooled mean  difference in fasting blood glucose  between Zinc supplemented and placebo groups was 18.13mg/dl ( 95%CI:33.85,2.41 ; p<0.05 ) .  2-h post-pr and ial blood sugar  also shows a similar distinct reduction in ( 34.87mg/dl [ 95%CI:75.44 ; 5.69 ] ) the Zinc treated group . The  reduction in HbA1c  was 0.54 % ( 95%CI:0.86;0.21 ) in the Zinc treated group . There were 8 studies comparing the effects of  Zinc supplementation  on  lipid parameters  in  patients with type-2 diabetes .  The  pooled mean difference for total cholesterol  between Zinc supplemented and placebo groups was 32.37mg/dl ( 95%CI:57.39,7.35 ; p<0.05 )  . Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  also showed a similar distinct  reduction  in the Zinc treated group , the pooled mean difference from r and om effects analysis was 11.19mg/dl ( 95%CI:21.14,1.25 ; p<0.05 ) . Studies have also shown a significant  reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures  after Zinc supplementation . This first comprehensive systematic review and meta- analysis on the effects of  Zinc supplementation  in patients with diabetes demonstrates that  Zinc supplementation   has beneficial effects on glycaemic control and promotes healthy lipid parameters .  Further studies are required to identify the exact biological mechanisms responsible for these results."
"VPurpose Two design concepts are currently used for  unicondylar knee arthroplasty ( UKA ) prostheses :   fixed bearing ( FB )  and  mobile bearing ( MB ) .  While  MB prostheses  have theoretical advantages over their  FB  counterparts , it is not clear whether they are associated with better outcomes . A systematic review was conducted to examine  survivorship differences  and  differences in failure modes  of between  FB and MB design s.  Methods PubMed , Scirus and Cochrane library data bases were search ed for  medial UKA outcome studies .  A  total of 44 papers , involving 9,463 knees , were eligible .  Outcomes examined included  knee function , survivorship and the reasons for , and incidence of , revision  for  FB and MB  prostheses . R and om effects meta- analysis was employed to obtain  pooled revision rate estimates  . Where available ,  cause-specific time to revision  was extracted . Results Mean follow-up was 8.7 years for FB and 5.9 years for  MB  prostheses . There were no other relevant baseline differences . The  overall crude revision rate  for FB and for  MB  prostheses was 0.90 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.65–1.21 ) and 1.51 ( 95 % CI 1.11–1.93 ) per 100 component years , respectively . After stratification on follow-up time and age , the  revision rates  were not substantially different , aside for younger patients in short term from studies with short-term follow-up . Conclusion No essential differences between the two design s were observed .  MB  and  FB  UKA design s have comparable  revision rates .  As our study is based on predominantly observational data , with large variations in reporting st and ards , inferences should be drawn with caution .Level of evidence IV."
"eBACKGROUND  Free provision of tangible goods  that may improve health is one approach to addressing discrepancies in health outcomes related to income , yet it is unclear whether providing goods for free improves health . We systematic ally review ed the literature that reported the association between the  free provision of tangible goods  and health outcomes . METHODS A search was performed for relevant literature  in all language s from 1995-May 2017 . Eligible studies were observational and experimental which had at least one tangible item provided for free and had at least one quantitative measure of health . Studies were excluded if the intervention was primarily  a  service and the free good was relatively unimportant ; if the good was a medication ; or if the data  in a  study was duplicated  in another  study  . Covidence screening software was used to manage articles for two levels of screening . Data was extracted using an adaption of the Cochrane data collection template . Health outcomes , those  that affect the quality or duration of life  , are the outcomes of interest . The study was registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42017069463 ) . FINDINGS The initial search identified  3370 articles and 59 were included in the final set with a range of 20 to 252 246 participants .  The  risk  of bias assessment revealed that overall , the studies were of medium to high quality . Among the studies included in this review , 80  health outcomes  were statistically significant favouring the intervention , 19  health outcomes  were statistically significant favouring the control , 141  health  outcomes were not significant and significance was unknown for 28 health outcomes . INTERPRETATION The results of this systematic review provide evidence that free goods can improve  health outcomes  in certain circumstances , although there were important gaps and limitations in the existing literature."
"lContext Is  radiofrequency catheter ablation  a better alternative than  medical therapy  for  patients with atrial fibrillation  ? Contribution This systematic review found that  radiofrequency ablation  after a failed drug course maintained sinus rhythm more often than continuation of drug therapy alone . Some studies found that ablation improved  quality of life  but did not necessarily reduce  stroke rates  compared with  medical therapy .  Fewer than 5 % of patients undergoing  ablation  reportedly experienced major adverse events , such as  pulmonary-vein stenosis or cardiac tamponade .  Caution Most available evidence was obtained in  middle-age adults with preserved left ventricular function and involved follow-up periods of 1 year or less .  The Editors Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice ( 1 ) . Its prevalence increases with age , from 0.1 % in  people younger than 55 years  to more than 9 %  by 80 years of age  ( 2 ) . The heavy burden of atrial fibrillation on morbidity , mortality , and health care re sources creates a pressing need for novel approaches to management . In some patients , adequate pharmacologic slowing of the ventricular response rate ( a rate-control strategy ) is sufficient to control symptoms . However , many patients remain symptomatic from the lack of organized atrial contraction and the persistent irregularity of the  ventricular response  in atrial fibrillation . In such patients , the appropriate treatment is restoration of normal sinus rhythm , achieved electrically or chemically ( a rhythm-control strategy ) ( 2 ) . Overall , a rhythm-control strategy with antiarrhythmic drugs offered no  survival advantage  over a rate-control strategy in 1 large trial ( 3 ) . An on-treatment analysis , however , suggested that sinus rhythm was associated with a considerable reduction in the  risk for death  , although antiarrhythmic drugs result ed in increased  mortality  ( 4 ) . The benefits of maintaining sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic  drugs  appeared to be offset by the serious adverse  effects  of the drugs .  Radiofrequency catheter ablation  is a promising approach that offers the benefits of maintaining  sinus rhythm  without the adverse effects of antiarrhythmic drugs .  Catheter ablation  for atrial fibrillation is based on the underst and ing that electrical activity emanating from the pulmonary veins frequently serves as a trigger for atrial fibrillation . In the late 1990s , Hassaguerre and colleagues ( 5 ) observed that elimination of local electrograms at these foci with radiofrequency energy reduced the  risk for recurrence of atrial fibrillation .  Currently , the foundation of most atrial fibrillation ablation procedures is to target and electrically isolate the pulmonary veins ( 6 ) . This may be achieved by delivering lesions immediately outside the ostia of the pulmonary veins or along a wider area in the left atrium encircling the veins . Additional lesion sets have been used to ablate nonpulmonary vein triggers of  atrial fibrillation  and to target atrial areas thought to be responsible for maintaining atrial fibrillation ( 6 ) . These linear lesions may be created in the posterior left atrium , the roof of the left atrium , the interatrial septum , and the isthmus formed between the mitral annulus and the pulmonary vein or left atrial appendage . The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality commissioned this report to review the evidence for the clinical effects and safety of  radiofrequency catheter ablation  for the management of atrial fibrillation . At present , the Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation , put forth by the Heart Rhythm Society and endorsed by several professional organizations , states that the foundation of most atrial fibrillation ablation procedures is to target the pulmonary veins , pulmonary vein antra , or both ( 6 ) . After discussion with a technical expert panel convened for this comparative effectiveness review and in accordance with the Heart Rhythm Society 's consensus statement , we review ed only studies that included the targeting of the pulmonary veins or pulmonary vein antra , with or without the addition of other strategies . Methods We developed and followed a st and ard protocol for all steps of the review . A technical report that describes our methods in detail , including the literature search strategies , results , and conclusions , is published elsewhere ( 7 ) . Key Questions Key questions on the effectiveness of  radiofrequency catheter ablation  compared with other available treatments ( for example , medical treatment or surgery ) were refined with input from the technical expert panel . The panel advised us that  8-mmtip and irrigated-tip catheters  are now the catheters of choice for radiofrequency ablation of  atrial fibrillation  in the  United States  . The conventional 4-mmtip  catheter  is rapidly being phased out of use for this indication . Thus , we limited our review to studies that used 8-mmtip or irrigated-tip  catheters  as a comparator . The following 3 key questions were formulated : 1 . What is the  effect  of  radiofrequency catheter ablation  on short-term ( 6 to 12 months ) and long-term ( > 12 months )  rhythm control ; rates of congestive heart failure ; changes in the size of the left atrium and ventricle ; rates of stroke ; quality of life ; avoiding anticoagulation ; and readmissions for paroxysmal , persistent , and long-st and ing persistent ( chronic ) atrial fibrillation  ? 2 . How does the  effect  of  radiofrequency ablation   on rhythm control  differ among the various techniques used ? 3 . What are the short- and long-term  complications and harms  associated with  radiofrequency ablation  ? Data Sources and Selection We search ed MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 2000 to December 2008 for studies of  adults with atrial fibrillation who underwent  radiofrequency catheter ablation .   We combined keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms for atrial fibrillation , pulmonary vein , radiofrequency  ablation  , and  catheter ablation .  We limited the search to  English-  language reports  of primary studies in adults that were published in peer- review ed journals .  We did not include unpublished data .  Six review  ers screened titles and abstract s to identify potentially relevant articles . They also examined the full-text articles of the potentially relevant abstract s for inclusion eligibility . We accepted longitudinal studies and excluded case series . We included r and omized trials of any sample size . For pragmatic reasons , we restricted the sample sizes in nonr and omized studies . For nonr and omized comparative studies and casecontrol studies , we included only  those with at least 10 patients per intervention group  . Noncomparative prospect i ve cohort studies had to have at least  50 patients receiving  radiofrequency catheter  ablation  , and retrospective cohort studies must have had at least  100 patients  . We included studies of  adults ( 18 years of age ) with paroxysmal , persistent , or permanent or chronic atrial fibrillation .  We accepted the definitions of the various types of atrial fibrillation used by the study authors , using the terms permanent and chronic atrial fibrillation as reported in the individual studies , even though the definitions varied . Notably , the consensus statement on  radiofrequency catheter ablation  for the treatment of atrial fibrillation published by the Heart Rhythm Society in 2007 no longer used the term chronic , instead adopting the term long-st and ing persistent for continuous atrial fibrillation lasting more than 1 year ( 6 ) . For a study to be included , at least 80 % of the patients had to be treated with first-time  radiofrequency ablation  for atrial fibrillation . We excluded  studies that were limited to patients with congenital heart disease , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , or the WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome .  The intervention of interest was  catheter-directed radiofrequency ablation  of the left atrium to prevent atrial fibrillation by using an 8-mmtip or irrigated-tip catheter . We included studies that compared 4-mmtip catheters to other catheters , but not studies that evaluated only 4-mmtip catheters .  Radiofrequency ablation  could be used as first- or second-line treatment ( that is , before or after a course of antiarrhythmic drugs ) and with or without concurrent antiarrhythmic drugs . We included studies of  radiofrequency ablation strategies  in which the explicit or intended goal was targeting of the pulmonary veins or pulmonary vein antra , with or without additional ablation . We did not evaluate  cryoablation or microwave ablation .  We included only studies that reported outcomes of interest at 6 months or more after the initial intervention or that reported adverse events at any time . Outcomes of interest included  rhythm control , congestive heart failure , changes in the size of the left atrium or ventricle , stroke , quality -of-life measures , avoidance of anticoagulation , readmissions , and re interventions for atrial fibrillation .  We excluded arrhythmia outcomes that occurred during the blanking period , which is defined as a postprocedure period ( typically between 1 and 3 months ) during which an episode of atrial fibrillation was not considered a recurrence . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data from each study were extracted by  1 of 4 review ers  and were confirmed by a clinical cardiac electrophysiologist author . The extracted data included information on  patient characteristics , ablation characteristics  ( for example , type of  catheter  tip ,  verification  of  electrical isolation  , and  ablation techniques  )  , other interventions , outcomes , study design , and quality .  For most outcomes , 6-month , 12-month , and last-reported-time-point data were included . All  mortality and adverse event data  were extracted . We used predefined criteria to grade study quality as good , fair , or poor . We also rated the strength of the overall body of evidence for each key question as high , moderate , low , or insufficient ( Appendix Table ) . The quality assessment and strength of the overall."
"dThe aim of this systematic review was to compare the clinical performance and failure modes of  teeth restored with  intra-radicular retainers .   A search was performed on PubMed / Medline , Central and Clinical Trials data bases for r and omized clinical trials comparing clinical behavior and failures of at least two types of retainers .  From 341 detected papers , 16 were selected for full-text analysis , of which 9 met the eligibility criteria .  A manual search added 2 more studies , totalizing 11 studies that were included in this review . Evaluated  retainers were  fiber ( prefabricated and customized ) and metal ( prefabricated and cast ) posts   , and follow-up ranged from 6 months to 10 years . Most studies showed good  clinical behavior  for evaluated intra-radicular retainers . Reported  survival rates  varied from 71 to 100 % for  fiber posts  and 50 to 97.1 % for  metal posts .  Studies found no difference in the  survival  among different  metal posts  and most studies found no difference between  fiber and metal posts .  Two studies also showed that  remaining dentine height , number of walls and ferrule increased the longevity of the  restored  teeth  .  Failures  of  fiber posts  were mainly due to  post loss of retention  , while  metal post  failures were mostly related to  root fracture , post fracture and crown and /or post loss of retention .  In conclusion ,  metal and fiber posts  present similar  clinical behavior  at short to medium term follow-up . Remaining dental structure and ferrule increase the  survival  of restored pulpless teeth . Studies with longer follow-up are needed."

"yBACKGROUND Large gaps in lipid treatment and medication adherence persist in  high-risk out patients in the United States .   Health information technology ( HIT )  is being applied to close quality gaps in chronic illness care , but its utility for lipid management has not been widely studied . OBJECTIVE To perform a qualitative review of the impact of  HIT interventions  on lipid management processes of care ( screening or testing ; drug initiation , titration or adherence ; or referrals ) or clinical outcomes ( percent at low density lipoprotein cholesterol goal ; absolute lipid levels ; absolute  risk scores  ; or  cardiac hospitalizations  ) in  out patients with coronary heart disease or at increased risk .  METHODS PubMed and Google Scholar data bases were search ed using Medical Subject Headings related to clinical informatics and cholesterol or lipid management . English language articles that described a r and omized controlled design , tested at least one HIT tool in  high risk out patients  , and reported at least 1 lipid management process measure or clinical outcome , were included . RESULTS  Thirty-four studies that enrolled 87,874 persons were identified .   Study ratings , outcomes , and magnitude of effects  varied widely . Twenty-three trials reported a significant  positive effect  from a  HIT  tool on  lipid management  , but only 14 showed evidence that HIT interventions  improve clinical outcomes .  There was mixed evidence that provider-level computerized decision support  improves outcomes .  There was more evidence in support of patient-level tools that provide connectivity to the healthcare system , as well as system-level interventions that involve data base monitoring and outreach by central ized care teams .  R and omized controlled trials show wide variability in the effects of  HIT on lipid management outcomes .  Evidence suggests that multilevel HIT approaches that target not only providers but include patients and systems approaches will be needed to improve lipid treatment , adherence and quality."
"yBackground  Resveratrol  as a polyphenolic compound might be able to reduce inflammatory mediators . Change in inflammatory state is identified by the measurement of inflammatory mediators such as  interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) , and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) .  The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis on r and omized controlled trials that assessed the effect of  resveratrol  on  concentration of serum inflammatory mediators .  MethodS ystematic search was performed up to October 2017 using ISI web of science , PubMed , Scopus , EMBASE , and Google scholar . Weighted mean difference was estimated either by subtracting baseline values from post-intervention value or as the post-intervention values . Fixed effect model was applied to analyze data where heterogeneity was < 25 % ; otherwise , r and om effects models were applied . The protocol was registered with PROSPERO ( No. CRD42018085098 ) . Results The meta- analysis and systematic review considered  15 trials , involving 658 adults aged 18–75 years  .  Resveratrol   significantly reduced serum CRP levels  ( WMD = −0.54 ; 95 % CI : −0.78 , −0.30 ; I2 = 77.7 % ; P < 0.0001 ) , but it had  no significant effect on serum IL-6  ( WMD = −0.06 ; 95 % CI : −0.27 , 0.14 ; I2 = 62.0 % ;  P = 0.005 ) and TNF-α levels  ( WMD = −0.20 ; 95 % CI : −0.55 , 0.16 ; I2 = 87.2 % ; P  < 0.0001  ) . Resveratrol   intake  reduced TNF-α  in young subjects ( WMD = −0.34 ; 95 % CI : −0.57 , −0.12 ; I2 = 60.5 % ; P = 0.038 ) and obese individuals ( WMD = −1.52 ; 95 % CI : −2.87 , −0.16 ; I2 = 74.1 % ; P = 0.004 ) . Conclusion The analysis indicated possible decreasing effect  of  resveratrol  on CRP  , but it might not be able to  change IL-6 and TNF-α concentrations  . More studies , separately on  males and females with obesity , and varied age  , are necessary."

"iPURPOSE To provide guidance to clinicians regarding the use of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreduction  among  women with stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer .  METHODS The Society of Gynecologic Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the literature . RESULTS Four phase III clinical trials form the primary evidence base for the recommendations . The published studies suggest that for  selected women with stage IIIC or IV epithelial ovarian cancer  ,  neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval cytoreduction  are non-inferior to  primary cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy  with respect to overall and progression-free survival and are associated with less perioperative morbidity and mortality . RECOMMENDATIONS All  women with suspected stage IIIC or IV invasive epithelial ovarian cancer  should be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist prior to initiation of therapy . The primary clinical evaluation should include a   CT  of the abdomen and pelvis  , and   chest  imaging  ( CT preferred ) . Women with a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to < 1 cm of residual disease ( ideally to no visible disease ) should receive  neoadjuvant chemotherapy .  Women who are fit for primary cytoreductive surgery , and with potentially resectable disease , may receive either  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  or  primary cytoreductive surgery .  However , primary  cytoreductive surgery  is preferred if there is a high likelihood of achieving  cytoreduction  to < 1 cm ( ideally to no visible disease ) with  acceptable morbidity .  Before  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  is delivered , all patients should have confirmation of an invasive  ovarian , fallopian  tube , or  peritoneal  cancer .

"6Background  Infantile colic  is a distressing condition characterised by excessive crying in the first few months of life . The aim of this research was to up date the synthesis of evidence of  complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM )  research literature on  infantile colic  and establish what evidence is currently available . Methods Medline , Embase and AMED ( via Ovid ) , Web of Science and Central via Cochrane library were search ed from their inception to September 2018 . Google Scholar and OpenGrey were search ed for grey literature and PROSPERO for ongoing review s. Published systematic review s that included r  and omised  controlled trials ( RCTs  ) of infants aged up to 1 year , diagnosed with infantile colic using st and ard diagnostic criteria  , were eligible . Review s of RCTs that assessed the  effectiveness  of any individual  CAM therapy  were included . Three review ers were involved in data extraction and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 scale and risk of bias using the ROBIS tool . Results Sixteen systematic review s were identified .   Probiotics , fennel extract   and   spinal manipulation   show promise to  alleviate symptoms of colic  , although some concerns remain .  Acupuncture and soy  are currently not recommended . The majority of the review s were assessed as having high or unclear risk of bias and low confidence in the findings . Conclusion There is clearly a need for larger and more method ologically sound RCTs to be conducted on the effectiveness of some  CAM therapies  for IC . Particular focus on probiotics in non-breastfed infants is pertinent . Systematic review registration PROSPERO : CRD42018092966."

"eAbstract Although several treatment options for  panic disorder ( PD )  are available , the best intervention for each individual patient remains uncertain and the use of a more  personalized therapeutic approach  in PD is required . In clinical practice , clinicians combine general scientific information and personal experience in the decision-making process to choose a tailored treatment for each patient . In this sense , clinicians already use a somehow personalized medicine strategy . However , the influence of their interpretative personal models may lead to bias related to personal convictions , not sufficiently grounded on scientific evidence . Hence , an effort to give some advice based on the science of personalized medicine could have positive effects on clinicians ’ decisions . Based on a narrative review of meta-analyses , systematic review s , and experimental studies , we proposed a first-step attempt of  evidence -based personalized therapy  for PD . We focused on some phenomenological profiles , encompassing symptoms during/outside panic attacks , related patterns of physiological functions , and some aspects of physical health , which might be worth considering when developing treatment plans for  patients with PD .  We considered  respiratory , cardiac , vestibular , and derealization/depersonalization  profiles , with related implication s for treatment . Given the extensiveness of the topic , we considered only medications and some somatic interventions . Our proposal should be considered neither exhaustive nor conclusive , as it is meant as a very preliminary step toward a future , robust evidence -based  personalized therapy  for PD . Clearly much more work is needed to achieve this goal , and recent technological advances , such as wearable devices , big data platforms , and the application of machine learning techniques , may help obtain reliable findings . We believe that combining the efforts of different research groups in this work in progress can lead to largely shared conclusions in the near future."
"sOBJECTIVES In-vitro experiments on   ormocers  (  ORganically MOdified CERamics )   have provided controversial results . Consequently , the objectives of this meta- analysis were to ( 1 ) compare clinical performances of  first generation ormocers versus conventional  composite restorations   , ( 2 ) explore the influence of various clinical factors and the impact of the quality of studies on published results . METHODS The following data bases were explored until 2017/01/08 : Ovid MEDLINE In-Process , Pubmed , CENTRAL , HTA , DARE , LILACS and Google Scholar .  Studies of more than two years  with quantitative comparisons between  ormocers  and control groups  were selected  . Outcome was the  failure of a restoration ( need to repair , remove or replace ) .  Multivariate r and om-effects Poisson 's regression was used to obtain a summary estimate . RESULTS 75 % of the 8 included trials concerned Class I/II restorations . Although non-significant , the  global failures  were higher for  ormocers  ( 0.22 [ -0.16 ; 0.61 ] ) . For Class I/II restorations , a significantly  higher sensitivity  was observed for  ormocer-based  material s compared to other composites ( 0.75 [ 0.01 ; 1.50 ] ) . An  increase of the number of restorations per patient  was associated with  higher marginal adaptation failures  for  ormocers  in Class I/II obturations ( 0.59 [ 0.11 ; 1.08 ] ) . SIGNIFICANCE This study did not identify clear advantages of using the first generation of  ormocer-based fillings  rather than conventional  composites  . Given the recent development of new , dimethacrylate-diluent-free  ormocer  matrices , potentially more stable and resistant , new r and omized clinical trials should be developed comparing this new family of  pure ormocers  with current composites."

"hConcerns are growing regarding the role of  dietary sugars  in the development of obesity and  cardiometabolic  diseases , including diabetes .  High-fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) and sucrose  are the most important  dietary sweeteners  . Both  HFCS  and sucrose have overlapping metabolic actions with adverse effects attributed to their fructose moiety . Ecological studies have linked the rise in fructose availability with the increases in obesity and  diabetes  worldwide . This link has been largely underpinned by animal models and select human trials of  fructose  overfeeding at high levels of exposure . Although  prospect i ve cohort  studies have shown significant associations comparing the highest with the lowest levels of intake  sugar-sweetened beverages  , these associations are small , do not hold at moderate levels of intake and are subject to collinearity effects from related dietary and lifestyle factors . Most systematic review s and meta-analyses from controlled feeding trials have shown that  fructose-containing sugars  in isocaloric exchange for other carbohydrates do not show evidence of harm and , in the case of  fructose  , may even have advantages for glycaemic control , especially at small doses . Nevertheless , trials in which  fructose-containing sugars  supplement diets with excess energy have shown  adverse effects ,  effects that appear more attributable to the excess energy than the sugar . There is no unequivocal evidence that  fructose  intake at moderate doses is directly related with  adverse metabolic effects  , although there is potentially cause for concern where  fructose  is provided at high doses or contributes excess energy to diets . Further investigation is warranted due to the significant knowledge gaps and weaknesses in existing research."
"l• STUDY DESIGN : Systematic review with meta‐ analysis . • BACKGROUND : The addition of  hip strengthening to knee strengthening  for  persons with patellofemoral pain  has the potential to optimize treatment effects . There is a need to systematic ally review and pool the current evidence in this area . • OBJECTIVE : To examine the efficacy of  hip strengthening  , associated or not with  knee strengthening  , to  increase strength , reduce pain , and improve activity  in  individuals with patellofemoral pain .  • METHODS : A systematic review of r and omized and /or controlled trials was performed . Participants in the review  ed studies were individuals with patellofemoral pain , and  the  experimental intervention was  hip and knee strengthening  .   Outcome data related to muscle strength , pain , and activity  were extracted from the eligible trials and combined in a meta‐ analysis . • RESULTS : The review included  14 trials involving 673 participants .  R and om‐effects meta‐analyses revealed that  hip and knee strengthening   decreased pain  ( mean difference , ‐3.3 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : ‐5.6 , ‐1.1 )  and improved activity  ( st and ardized mean difference , 1.4 ; 95 % CI : 0.03 , 2.8 ) compared to  no  training/placebo . In addition  , hip and knee strengthening  was  superior to knee strengthening  alone  for decreasing pain  ( mean difference , ‐1.5 ; 95 % CI : ‐2.3 , ‐0.8 )  and improving activity  ( st and ardized mean difference , 0.7 ; 95 % CI : 0.2 , 1.3 ) . Results were maintained beyond the intervention period . Meta‐analyses showed no significant changes  in  strength for any of the interventions . •   : Hip and knee strengthening  is effective and  superior to knee strengthening  alone  for decreasing pain and improving activity  in  persons with patellofemoral pain ;  however , these outcomes were achieved without a concurrent change in strength . • LEVEL OF EVIDENCE : Therapy , level."
"sWe have conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature concerning  outcome and clinical effectiveness  of   prostheses  used for primary total hip replacement ( THR ) in Norway .  The study is based on two Health Technology Assessment reports from the UK ( Faulkner et al. 1998 , Fitzpatrick et al. 1998 ) , review ing the literature from 1980 to 1995 . Using a similar search strategy , we have evaluated the  literature from 1996 through 2000 .  We included  129 scientific and medical publications  which were assessed according to a specific appraisal protocol . The majority ( 72 % ) were observational studies , whereas only 9 % were r and omized studies . We could not retrieve any peer- review ed documentation for one third of the  implants .  The Charnley prosthesis had by far the best and most comprehensive evidence base with better than 90 %  implant survival  after about 10 years .  Survival of the Charnley prosthesis  declines by about 10 % during each of the two following decades . Except for the Charnley and Lubinus IP , no other prosthesis on the market in Norway has given long-term results ( > 15 years ) . 5 other  cemented implants  have given comparable results at about 10 years of follow-up . Some uncemented stems have shown promising  medium-term outcome  , but no combination of uncemented cup and stem fulfilled the benchmark criterion of > or = 90 %  implant survival  at 10 years , which we propose as a minimum requirement for unrestricted clinical use for prostheses used in primary THR . New or undocumented  implants  should be introduced through a four-step model including pre clinical testing , small series evaluated by radiosterometry , r and omized clinical trial involving comparison with a well-documented prosthesis , and finally , surveillance of clinical use through registers."
"yClinical practice guidelines identify  lithium  as a first line treatment for  mood stabilization and reduction of suicidality  in  bipolar disorders ( BD ) ;  however , most individuals show sub-optimal response . Identifying biomarkers for  lithium  response could enable personalization of treatment and refine criteria for stratification of BD cases into treatment-relevant subgroups . Existing systematic review s identify potential biomarkers of  lithium  response , but none directly address the conceptual issues that need to be addressed to enhance translation of research into precision prescribing of  lithium .  For example , although clinical syndrome subtyping of BD has not led to customized individual treatments , we emphasize the importance of assessing clinical response phenotypes in biomarker research . Also , we highlight the need to give greater consideration to the quality of prospect i ve longitudinal monitoring of illness activity and the differentiation of non-response from partial or non-adherence with medication . It is unlikely that there is a single biomarker for   lithium  response  or  tolerability  , so this review argues that more research should be directed toward the exploration of biosignatures . Importantly , we emphasize that an integrative science approach may improve the likelihood of discovering the optimal combination of clinical factors and multimodal biomarkers ( e.g. , blood omics , neuroimaging , and actigraphy derived-markers ) . This strategy could uncover a valid   lithium  response phenotype  and facilitate development of a composite prediction algorithm . Lastly , this narrative review discusses how these strategies could improve eligibility criteria for  lithium  treatment in BD , and highlights barriers to translation to clinical practice including the often-overlooked issue of the cost-effectiveness of introducing biomarker tests in psychiatry."
 This systematic review demonstrates that body weight is an important predictor of variation in  circulating  25OHD in cohorts  on vitamin D  supplements . Our model provides an estimate of the  daily vitamin D  dose that is necessary for achieving adequate circulating 25OHD levels in  vitamin D-insufficient or vitamin D-deficient individuals/cohorts  with different  body weights  and ages.
"tESTRO , the European Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology , or with its new name European Society for Radiation Oncology , is a scientific society . It means that the prime aim of ESTRO is to bring to bring people together on an individual basis who have a common interest in improving the scientific  conduct  of radiotherapy and cancer treatment in Europe by ensuring that proper radiotherapy is available in the multidisciplinary treatment of cancer and applied with the right indication and with the most optimal technique . One of the main aims of this endeavour was to create a platform for scientific exchange through meetings and through the establishment of a scientific journal [ 1 ] . Thus Radiotherapy and Oncology was launched shortly after the foundation of ESTRO and has become the society ’s prime vehicle for scientific communication by serving  ESTRO members  through almost the entire 30 years of the society ’s existence . The aim was to create a peer review ed high quality international journal and that aim has indeed been fulfilled . ‘ ‘ The green journal ’ ’ is today , together with ‘ ‘ the red journal ’ ’ , the prime international platform for scientific communication within radiotherapy . Both journals are anchored in large scientific societies and serve basically the same medical , physical and biological community and at the same scientific level ; the two journals are in the most recent  Impact Factor list  ranked almost back to back , indicating an equal importance and contribution to science . Radiotherapy and Oncology is more than a scientific journal , it also serves other purpose s such as facilitate  education  through  ( educational ) review  s and improving  the st and ard of care  by bringing forward guidelines for conduct of radiotherapy . Finally , the journal also tries to maintain a communication platform between the science produced by the membership of ESTRO and therefore it brings papers frommembers in the different European countries , sometimes at the expense of ultimate scientific quality , but with the underst and ing that it is important that the entire ESTRO membership gets access and opportunity to publish in a high ranked journal . Knowing that the weakest link is the most important to strengthen , the Journal has increasingly focussed on publishing guidelines , often produced by ESTRO committees or European consensus panels together with meta-analyses and review s. The focus on systematic review s is thus another example of the wish to bring forward evidence based refinement."
"hINTRODUCTION Pain is a frequent clinical symptom with significant impact on the patient 's well-being . Therefore , adequate pain management is of utmost importance . While cannabinoids have become a more popular alternative to traditional types of pain medication among patients , the quality of evidence supporting the use of cannabinoids has been question ed . The beneficial and harmful effects of cannabinoids in patients with pain is unknown . Accordingly , we aim to assess the  efﬁcacy , tolerability and safety  of  cannabinoids ( herbal , plant-derived extracts and synthetic )  compared with  placebo  or  no  intervention for any type of pain . METHODS AND ANALYSES We will conduct a systematic review of r and omised clinical trials with meta- analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of cannabinoids in any dose , formulation and duration . We will accept  placebo or no treatment  as  control interventions .  We will include  participants with any type of pain ( acute and chronic pain , cancer-related pain , headache , neuropathic pain or any other types of pain ) .  We will systematic ally search The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , Embase , Science Citation Index and BIOSIS for relevant literature . We will follow the recommendations by Cochrane and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis statement . The risk of systematic errors ( bias ) and r and om errors ( play of chance ) will be assessed . The overall certainty of evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation approach . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not a requirement since no primary data will be collected . The findings of this systematic review will be su bmi tted for peer- review ed publication and disseminated in national and international conferences . DISCUSSION Although cannabinoids are now being used to manage different pain conditions , the evidence for the clinical effects are unclear . The present review will systematic ally assess the current evidence for the benefits and harms of cannabinoids to inform practice and future research."
" There is a continually exp and ing literature on PD ; the Panel notes that this document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly . The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient in the context of that patient 's history , values , and goals for treatment . As the science relevant to PD evolves and improves , the strategies presented here will be amended to remain consistent with the highest st and ards of clinical care."
"dI n the wake of serious health concerns raised by the Women ’s Health Initiative and Heart and Estrogen/ progestin Replacement Study clinical trials , prescriptions for  hormone therapy  have declined dramatically , leaving many women without effective treatment for menopausal  symptoms  . Several  nonhormonal pharmacologic therapies  have shown promise for reducing  vasomotor symptoms  , including  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , gabapentin , and clonidine .  However , most are only modestly effective , and all have side effects that may limit their use . A number of  herbal therapies  are marketed to women as being safe and effective in reducing menopausal symptoms , including  phytoestrogens , black cohosh , dong quai , evening primrose oil , and red clover .  Yet , systematic review s of r and omized , controlled trials found that most were ineffective and these review s raised several concerns about the inadequacy of safety data on botanical supplements . Still , interest in  nonhormonal  and particularly in  complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) therapies  for menopausal symptoms remains strong . A recent cross-sectional analysis in the multiethnic Study of  Women ’s  Health Across the Nation found that 53 % of the participants used some form of  CAM  ( excluding diet ,  vitamins  ,  exercise  , and  prayer  ) and that rates of use generally did not vary by menopausal status or by presence of vasomotor symptoms . In a survey  of 1,296 Australian women with menopausal symptoms  , 54 % reported using  CAM  within the past year for the treatment of menopausal symptoms . In the continued search for a safe and effective  CAM therapy  for menopausal symptoms , behavioral interventions , such as yoga or  paced  breathing , are attractive options because they would not carry the potential risks of pharmacologic or botanical therapies . Yoga is an ancient Indian practice that involves the use of movement , postures , breathing techniques , and meditation . The term yoga is derived from the Sanskrit term yuj , meaning Bto yoke^ or Bto unite,^ and the goal of yoga has been described as uniting the body and mind to achieve enlightenment . Yoga has become increasingly popular outside of India , with a 2008  survey of 5,050 people estimating  that  7  %  of US adults  practice yoga . Clinical trials have also demonstrated many potential health benefits of yoga , including reductions in  blood pressure , dyslipidemia , and insulin resistance .  Although the exact mechanisms of  hot flashes  remain unknown , physiologic studies have demonstrated that heightened  sympathetic nervous system activity  plays an important role . Small uncontrolled studies have shown that yoga increases heart  rate variability  and  decreases oxygen consumption , heart rate , and blood pressure  , all indicative of decreased sympathetic activity . In addition to its biological effects ,  yoga  may also have beneficial psychological effects that could lead women to find physical symptoms less bothersome and /or help them to cope better with changes during menopause . In this issue of Menopause , Chattha and colleagues report results from one of the largest published trials of  yoga  for menopausal symptoms . The authors  r and omized 120 Indian women with menopausal symptoms to  an   integrated  yoga program or a physical activity control intervention  for five 60-minute sessions per week over 8 weeks . The  yoga program  involved  physical postures , breathing techniques , meditation , and lectures  , and the  control intervention included simple physical exercises ( stretching , brisk walking ) and lectures .  The authors found significant improvements in the yoga versus control group in  vasomotor symptoms  ( P G 0.05 ) and a trend toward improvement in  psychological symptoms  ( P = 0.06 ) , both measured with the  Greene Climacteric Scale .  The yoga group also had significantly reduced  perceived stress  ( P G 0.001 ) and  neuroticism  ( P G 0.05 ) compared with the control group . Strengths of the study include its relatively large sample size and the carefully design ed control intervention . Limitations include concerns about reproducibility and feasibility outside the study setting . Despite the increasing popularity of yoga , a  yoga intervention  requiring 60 minutes of supervised instruction five times per week may not be practical for many Western women . The racial/ethnic homogeneity of the sample and the exclusion of  women with hypertension , diabetes , and thyroid disease  , which are common  conditions in peri and postmenopausal women  , also limit the generalizability of the study findings . In addition , participants could not be blinded to intervention assignment , and the main outcomes were question naires rather than hot flash diaries or objective measures . Thus , some of the self-reported improvements may have been due to biased outcome reporting . Previous published studies of  yoga  for menopausal symptoms include two uncontrolled pilot trials and one three-arm , r and omized , controlled trial . A pilot trial of an 8-week  restorative yoga intervention  ( weekly 90-minute classes plus recommended home practice ) in  14 women with moderate to severe hot flashes  found approximately 30 % reductions in  hot flash frequency  ( P = 0.003 ) and  severity  ( P = 0.02 ) as measured by 7-day diaries . Significant improvements were also found in  sleep quality  ( P = 0.02 ) and."
 Certain types of  nutrient supplementation  are beneficial in  preventing AD development and reducing its severity .  Future research elucidating the mechanisms underlying the actions of nutritional supplementation on AD is necessary.
" : Four clinical features ( prior stroke/TIA , advancing age , hypertension , diabetes ) are consistent independent risk factors for stroke in  atrial fibrillation patients .  Prior stroke/TIA is the most powerful risk factor and reliably confers a  high stroke risk  ( > 5 % per year , averaging 10 % per year ) .  Absolute stroke rates  associated with other individual risk factors are difficult to precisely estimate from available data."
" Almost three-fifths ( 59 % ) of all PPP patients had  involvement of both palms and soles  , while exclusive palmar or plantar involvement was seen in 21 % and 20 % of patients , respectively . Future research should be performed to eluci date basic epidemiological and clinical characteristics of PPP , which would be helpful for proper consideration of this condition."
"nIntroduction Iron deficiency is the most prevalent nutrient deficiency in the world , particularly during pregnancy . According to the literature , anemia , particularly severe anemia , is associated with increased risk of maternal mortality . It also puts mothers at risk of multiple perinatal complications . Numerous studies in the past have evaluated the impact of supplementation with  iron and iron-folate  but data regarding the efficacy and quality of evidence of these interventions are lacking . This article aims to address the impact of  iron with and without folate supplementation  on  maternal anemia  and provides outcome specific quality according to the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group ( CHERG ) guidelines . Methods We conducted a systematic review of published r and omized and quasi-r and omized trials on PubMed and the Cochrane Library as per the CHERG guidelines . The studies selected employed  daily supplementation of iron with or without folate compared  with  no intervention/placebo  , and also compared  intermittent supplementation with the daily regimen .  The studies were abstract ed and grade d according to study design , limitations , intervention specifics and outcome effects . CHERG rules were then applied to evaluate the impact of these interventions on iron  deficiency anemia  during  pregnancy  . Recommendations were made for the Lives Saved Tool ( LiST ) . Results After  screening 3550 titles , 31 studies were selected  for assessment using CHERG criteria . Daily  iron  supplementation result ed in 73 % reduction in the  incidence of anemia  at term ( RR = 0.27 ; 95 % CI : 0.17 – 0.42 ; r and om effects model ) and 67 % reduction in  iron deficiency anemia  at term ( RR = 0.33 ; 95 % CI : 0.16 – 0.69 ; r and om model ) compared to no intervention/placebo  .  For this intervention , both these outcomes were grade d as ‘ moderate ’ quality evidence .  Daily supplementation with iron-folate  was associated with 73 % reduction  in anemia  at term ( RR = 0.27 ; 95 % CI : 0.12 – 0.56 ; r and om model ) with a quality grade of ‘ moderate ’ . The effect of the same intervention on  iron deficiency anemia  was non-significant ( RR = 0.43 ; 95 % CI : 0.17 – 1.09 ; r and om model ) and was grade d as ‘ low ’ quality evidence . There was no difference in  rates of anemia  at term with  intermittent iron-folate vs. daily iron-folate supplementation  ( RR = 1.61 ; 95 % CI : 0.82 –3.14 ; r and om model ) . Conclusion Applying the CHERG rules , we recommend a 73 % reduction in  anemia  at term with daily  iron ( alone ) supplementation or iron/folate ( combined ) vs. no intervention or placebo ;  for inclusion in the LiST model . Given the paucity of studies of  intermittent iron or iron-folate supplementation  , especially in developing countries , we recommend further evaluation of this intervention in comparison with daily supplementation regimen."
"sThis systematic review up date s the current state of evidence on the effectiveness of  softer flooring and cushioned shoe insoles  on reducing   musculoskeletal discomfort  amongst workers who are required to st and for prolonged periods to work  and the impact of factors such as age and gender on the outcomes . A systematic search identified  10 unique studies that met the eligibility criteria .  The heterogeneity of study design s impacted on the strength of evidence . A moderate level of evidence was found in support of using  cushioned material s  in reducing  discomfort/fatigue  among  st and ing workers .  A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over  anti-fatigue mats .  Insufficient information exists for the impact of gender or age . Larger , good quality prospect i ve intervention trials based in real workplaces that consider the impact of psychosocial and organisational factors on  musculoskeletal discomfort  whilst st and ing at work are required to inform industry recommendations."
" While there is substantial research literature focused on RTW , there are only a small number of quality workplace-based RTW intervention studies that involve  workers with MSK or pain-related conditions and MH conditions .  We recommend implementing  multi-domain interventions  ( i.e. with  healthcare provision , service coordination , and work accommodation components )  to help reduce  lost time  for MSK or pain-related conditions and MH conditions . Practitioners should also consider implementing these programs to help improve work functioning and reduce costs associated with work disability."
"sBackground This article aims to up date the existing systematic review evidence elicited by Mickenautsch et al. up  to 18  January 2008 ( published in the European Journal of Paediatric Dentistry in 2009 ) and addressing the review question of whether , in the same  dentition  and same  cavity class  ,   glass-ionomer cement ( GIC )  restored cavities  show less recurrent carious lesions on cavity margins than cavities restored with  amalgam  . Methods The systematic literature search was extended beyond the original search date and a further h and - search and reference check was done . The quality of accepted trials was assessed , using up date d quality criteria , and the risk of bias was investigated in more depth than previously reported . In addition , the focus of quantitative synthesis was shifted to single data sets extracted from the accepted trials . Results The data base search ( up to 10 August 2010 ) identified 1 new trial , in addition to the 9 included in the original systematic review , and 11 further trials were included after a h and - search and reference check . Of these  21 trials , 11 were excluded and 10 were accepted  for data extraction and quality assessment . Thirteen dichotomous data sets of primary outcomes and  4  data sets with  secondary outcomes  were extracted . Meta- analysis and cumulative meta- analysis were used in combining clinical ly homogenous data sets . The overall results of the computed data sets suggest that  GIC  has a  higher caries-preventive effect  than  amalgam  for restorations in permanent teeth . No difference was found for restorations in the primary dentition . Conclusion This outcome is in agreement with the conclusions of the original systematic review . Although the findings of the trials identified in this up date may be considered to be less affected by attrition- and publication bias , their risk of selection - and detection/performance bias is high . Thus , verification of the currently available results requires further high- quality r and omised control trials."

"9Background Awareness of the magnitude of  contact sports-related concussions  has risen exponentially in recent years . Our objective is to conduct a prospect ively registered systematic review of the scientific evidence regarding interventions to prevent contact sports-related concussions . Methods Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation methodology , we performed a systematic review of the literature to answer seven population , intervention , comparator , and outcomes ( PICO ) questions regarding  concussion education , head protective equipment , rules prohibiting high-risk activity  and  neck strengthening exercise  for prevention of contact sports-related concussion  in pediatric and adult amateur athletes .  A query of MEDLINE , PubMed , Scopus , Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature , and Embase was performed . Letters to the editor , case reports , book chapters , and review articles were excluded , and all articles review ed were written in English . Results  Thirty-one studies  met the inclusion criteria and were applicable to our PICO questions . Conditional recommendations are made supporting preventive  interventions concussion  education and rules prohibiting high-risk activity for both pediatric and adult amateur athletes and neck strengthening exercise in adult amateur athletes . Strong recommendations are supported for head protective equipment in both pediatric and adult amateur athletes . Strong recommendations regarding newer football helmet technology in adult amateur athletes and rules governing the implementation of body-checking in youth ice hockey are supported . Conclusion Despite increasing scientific attention to sports-related concussion , studies evaluating preventive interventions remain relatively sparse . This systematic review serves as a call to focus research on primary prevention strategies for sports-related concussion . Level of evidence IV . PROSPERO registration number # 42016043019."
"DBackground and Aim Extensive epidemiological evidence suggests that  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD )  is the primary chronic liver disease worldwide . However , some studies have showed conflicting results on the effects of  probiotics and synbiotics supplementation .  Therefore , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to investigate the effectiveness of the supplementation in  subjects with NAFLD .  Methods We search ed systematic ally  PubMed , Cochrane , and Embase data bases up to April 2018  and checked manually the bibliography of the original articles . The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool . Results This study analyzed  15 r and omized , controlled trials involving 782 patients with NAFLD .   Probiotics and synbiotics supplementation  could significantly  improve liver steatosis , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , triglyceride , total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein , low-density lipoprotein , homeostasis model assessment -insulin resistance , liver stiffness and tumor necrosis factor-alpha  ( all P < 0.05 ) . But the supplementation could not  ameliorate body mass index  ( mean difference [ MD ] = −0.00 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : −0.22 to 0.22 , P = 0.99 ) ,  waist circumference  ( MD = −0.01 ; 95 % CI −0.03 to 0.02 , P = 0.57 )  and fasting blood  sugar ( st and ard mean difference [ SMD ] = −0.10 ; 95 % CI −0.32 to 0.12 , P = 0.39 ) . Conclusion We present clear evidence for the  benefit of probiotics and synbiotics supplementation   for liver steatosis , liver enzymes , lipid profiles and liver stiffness  in patients with NAFLD."

"kBackground :  Fatigue  is the most common and unpleasant symptom of  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) .  However , there is limited information regarding how  exercise  affects  fatigue  . Aims : The purpose of this study is to review and synthesize the current knowledge concerning the effectiveness of  exercise training  for treating  fatigue   among adults with SLE .  The characteristics of beneficial  exercise training  are further evaluated . Methods : We conducted a systematic review and meta‐ analysis . The data bases search ed were MEDLINE , CINAHL , PEDro , Cochrane Library , Scopus , and PQDT from their inception to  February 3  ,  2016  . The quality of each selected study was assessed using the PEDro scale . A between‐group analysis was performed to evaluate the  effectiveness of the  exercise training  .  Data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration 's RevMan 5.3 ( Copenhagen , Denmark ) . Results : Two r and omized controlled trials and one quasiexperimental study were included in this systematic review and meta‐ analysis .  Aerobic exercise  , three times a week and of moderate intensity , was a common component of the three studies . Two studies were conducted in a supervised setting and one study was based at home . One study lasted 8 weeks and two studies lasted 12 weeks . The meta‐ analysis showed that  aerobic exercise  could  decrease fatigue  ( MD = –.52 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] [ –.91 , –.13 ] , p = .009 ) and  increase vitality  ( MD = 14.98 , 95 % CI [ 7.45 , 22.52 ] , p < .001 ) . The subgroup analysis indicated that 12 weeks  of exercise training and exercise  under a supervised setting  significantly benefited fatigue  . Linking Evidence to Action : The pooled data indicate that 12 weeks  of an aerobic exercise program  that is supervised by health professionals  could reduce fatigue and increase vitality  for  patients with SLE . SLE patients with mild disease  should begin with moderate intensity for at least 20 minutes , 3 days a week."
"eThe purpose of the study was to make a systematic review and describe and confront recent studies that compare the presence of disordered eating and its complications in  young female athletes and controls subjects  - PubMed  , Scielo , Medline , ScienceDirect , WILEY InterScience , Lilacs  and  Cochrane  were the data bases used for this review . Out of  169 studies 22 were selected and 11,000 women from 68 sports were studied .  The  short version of the EAT  was the most common instrument used to track disordered eating . Results showed that 55 % found  no significant difference  in the  percentage of disordered eating  between athletes and controls . Also a higher percentage of studies reported  higher frequency of menstrual dysfunction  in athletes than controls and finally 50 % of the studies found  incidence of low bone mass  in controls . Not all the studies that investigated all the conditions in the triad , but the authors concluded that it seemed that athletes were in more severe stage of this disorder . Due to the heterogeneity of the studies , a definitive conclusion about the groups and at highest risk for disordered eating and its complications remains to be eluci date."
"dLow  selenium status  is associated with increased risk of  Graves ' disease ( GD ) .  While several trials have discussed the  efficacy  of  selenium supplementation  for  thyroid function  , in  GD patients  , the effectiveness of  selenium  intake as adjuvant therapy remains unclear . In this systematic review and meta- analysis , we aim ed to determine the  efficacy  of  selenium supplementation  on  thyroid function  in  GD patients .  Two review ers search ed PubMed , Web of Science , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ,  and four Chinese data bases for studies published up to October 31  , 2017 . RCTs comparing the effect of  selenium supplementation  on thyroid hyperfunction in  GD patients on antithyroid medication to  placebo   were included .  Serum free thyroxine ( FT4 ) , free triiodothyronine ( FT3 ) , thyrotrophic hormone receptor antibody ( TRAb ) , and thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels  were assessed .  Ten trials involving 796 patients were included .  R and om-effects meta-analyses in weighted mean difference ( WMD ) were performed for 3 , 6 , and 9 months of supplementation and compared to  placebo  administration .  Selenium supplementation  significantly  decreased FT4  ( WMD=-0.86 [ confidence interval (CI)-1.20 to -0.53 ] ; p=0.756 ; I2=0.0 % ) and FT3 ( WMD=-0.34 [ CI-0.66 to -0.02 ] ; p=0.719 ; I2=0.0 % ) levels at 3 months , compared to placebo administration ; these findings were consistent at 6 but not 9 months .  TSH levels  were more elevated in the group of patients  taking selenium  than in the control group at 3 and 6 , but not 9 months .  TRAb levels  decreased at 6 but not 9 months . At 6 months , patients on  selenium supplementation  were more likely than controls to show  improved thyroid function ;  however , the effect disappeared at 9 months . Whether these effects correlate with clinical ly relevant measures remains to be demonstrated."
"sβ-Blockers are less effective than other antihypertensive drug classes in reducing  central systolic blood pressure ( cSBP )  as compared with  peripheral SBP ( pSBP  ) . Whether this effect is less pronounced with  vasodilating β-blockers ( VBB )  when compared with  nonvasodilating β-blockers ( NVBB )  remains unsettled . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and  omized  trials exploring the effects of  β-blockers  on both pSBP and cSBP in hypertension . We  selected 20 studies , for a total of 32 treatment arms ( n=21 for  NVBB  , n=11 for  VBB  ) and 1263 participants ( n=962 for  NVBB  , n=301 for   VBB  ) .  pSBP  decreased from 150 to 133 mm Hg for NVBB and from 145 to 134 mm Hg for  VBB . cSBP  decreased from 137 to 126 mm Hg for NVBB and from 132 to 123 mm Hg for  VBB . SBP amplification ( pSBP-cSBP )  decreased significantly under VBB ( -5.6 mm Hg ; 95 % confidence interval , -7.8 , -3.4 mm Hg ) , but not under NVBB ( -1.1 mm Hg ; 95 % confidence interval , -3.4 , + 1.2 mm Hg ; P<0.01 versus NVBB ) . There was high heterogeneity both within and between β-blockers subclasses . In a meta-regression model , the weighted difference in treatment-induced  changes in SBP amplification  between NVBB and VBB lost its significance after adjustment for mean age and baseline pSBP and heart rate ( -2.9±2.3 mm Hg ; P=0.22 ) and was almost abolished after adjustment for treatment-induced  heart  rate changes ( -0.1±0.5 mm Hg ; P=0.78 ) . In  conclusion  , NVBBs , but not VBBs , determine a  lower reduction in cSBP  than in pSBP . However , the difference in  treatment-induced SBP amplification  changes between NVBB and VBB is nearly abolished after accounting for differences in heart rate changes."
" There is weak evidence that regular planned recall of patients for appointments , structured monitoring of risk factors and prescribing , and education for patients can be effective in increasing the proportions of patients within target levels for cholesterol control and blood pressure . Further research in this area would benefit from greater st and ardisation of the outcomes measured."
"PAlthough elevated systemic blood pressure ( BP ) results in high intravascular pressure , the main complications of hypertension are related to thrombosis rather than haemorrhage . It therefore seemed plausible that use of  antithrombotic therapy  may be useful in preventing  thrombosis-related complications  of elevated BP . The objectives were to conduct a systematic review of the role of  antiplatelet therapy  and  anticoagulation  in  patients with BP  , to address the following hypotheses : ( i )  antiplatelet agents  reduce total  deaths  and /or  major thrombotic events  when compared to  placebo  or other  active  treatment  ;  and ( ii )  oral anticoagulants  reduce total  deaths  and /or  major thromboembolic events  when compared to  placebo  or  other active treatment .  A systematic review of r and omised studies in  patients with elevated BP  was performed .  Studies were included  if they were  > 3 months in  duration and compared  antithrombotic therapy  with control or other active treatment . One meta- analysis of  antiplatelet therapy  for  secondary prevention in patients with elevated BP  reported an absolute reduction in  vascular events  of 4.1 % as compared to  placebo . Acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA )  did not reduce  stroke or ‘ all cardiovascular events ’  compared to  placebo  in  primary prevention patients with elevated BP and no prior cardiovascular disease .  Based on one large trial , ASA taken for 5 years reduced  myocardial infa rct ion  ( ARR , 0.5 % , NNT 200 for 5 years ) , increased  major haemorrhage  ( ARI , 0.7 % , NNT 154 ) , and did not reduce  all cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality .  In two small trials ,  warfarin  alone or in combination with  ASA  did not reduce  stroke or coronary events .   Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa  inhibitors as well as ticlopidine and  clopidogrel  have not been sufficiently evaluated in patients with elevated BP . To conclude for primary prevention in  patients with elevated BP  , antiplatelet  therapy  with ASA can not be recommended since the magnitude of benefit , a reduction  in myocardial infa rct ion  , is negated by a harm of similar magnitude , an increase in  major haemorrhage .  For secondary prevention in  patients  with elevated BP ,  antiplatelet therapy  is recommended because the magnitude of the absolute benefit is many times greater .  Warfarin therapy alone  or  in combination with aspirin  in  patients with elevated BP  can not be recommended because of lack of demonstrated benefit . Further trials of antithrombotic  therapy  are required in patients with elevated BP."

The overall treatment effect for each inflammatory marker was calculated as weighted mean differences ( WMD ) and corresponding 95 % of confidence interval ( CI ) between changes in intervention and control groups . Changes for each parameter were calculated by subtracting baseline values from the final mean values . The I2 statistic was used to examine between‐ study heterogeneity . When heterogeneity was > 25 % , r and om effect model was run to estimate pooled effect size . There had been  nineteen articles in our meta‐ analysis and twenty‐one articles in systematic review .  Our meta‐ analysis results indicated  that ALA   significantly decreased serum CRP levels  ( WMD= −0.29 , 95 % CI : −0.46 , −0.12 ; I2 = 97.6 % ,  P < 0.0001 ) , IL‐6  ( WMD= −3.02 , 95 % CI : −4.03 , −2.01 ; I2 = 99.7 % ,  P < 0.0001 ) and TNF‐&agr ;  levels ( WMD= −1.71 , 95 % CI : −2.30 , −1.13 ; I2 = 99.0 % , P < 0.0001 ) . Our results indicated possible  decreasing effect  of ALA  on inflammatory mediators  especially in high dose . More r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) are necessary with different intervention duration and on women and men separately."
"eBACKGROUND  Perioperative shivering  is clinical ly common during  cesarean sections under neuraxial anesthesia  , and several  neuraxial adjuvants  are reported to have preventive effects on it . However , the results of current studies are controversial and the effects of these neuraxial  adjuvants  remain unclear . AIM To evaluate the effects of  neuraxial adjuvants  on  perioperative shivering  during  cesarean sections  , thus providing an optimal choice for clinical application . METHODS A systematic review and network meta- analysis were conducted following the PRISMA ( Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta- analysis ) guidelines . Analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 14.0 . We search ed PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central data bases for eligible clinical trials assessing the effects of  neuraxial adjuvants  on  perioperative shivering  and other adverse events during  cesarean sections .   Perioperative shivering  was defined as the primary endpoint , and  nausea , vomiting , pruritus , hypotension , and bradycardia  were the secondary outcomes . RESULTS  Twenty-six studies using 9 neuraxial  adjuvants  for obstetric anesthesia during caesarean sections were included .  The results showed that , compared with  placebo , pethidine , fentanyl , dexmedetomidine , and sufentanil  significantly reduced the  incidence of perioperative shivering .  Among the four neuraxial adjuvants ,  pethidine  was the most effective one for  shivering prevention  ( OR = 0.15 , 95%CI : 0.07 - 0.35 , surface under the cumulative ranking curve 83.9 ) , but with a high  incidence  of  nausea  ( OR = 3.15 , 95%CI : 1.04 - 9.57 ) and  vomiting  ( OR = 3.71 , 95%CI : 1.81 - 7.58 ) . The  efficacy  of fentanyl for  shivering prevention  was slightly inferior to  pethidine  ( OR = 0.20 , 95%CI : 0.09 - 0.43 ) , however , it significantly decreased the  incidence of nausea  ( OR = 0.34 , 95%CI : 0.15 - 0.79 ) and  vomiting  ( OR = 0.25 , 95%CI : 0.11 - 0.56 ) . In addition , compared with  sufentanil  ,  fentanyl  showed no impact on  haemodynamic stability and the incidence of pruritus .    Pethidine , fentanyl , dexmedetomidine  , and  sufentanil  appear to be effective for preventing  perioperative shivering  in puerperae undergoing cesarean  sections  . Considering the risk-benefit profiles of the included neuraxial adjuvants ,  fentanyl  is probably the optimal choice."
"nThis review examines the role of  exercise and physical activity  for preventing   weight gain  in older people .  A structured search using MeSH-vocabulary and Title/ Abstract - search es was conducted in PubMed for  January 2000 to June 2011  , identifying weight gain and exercise or physical activity as study topics , and  aged adults  as  target group  . In study selection , all types of  exercise and physical activity  and any measure of  weight change  in  aged adults ( ≥65 years ) or postmenopausal women  were considered .  N=9 primary studies were identified . All were conducted in the US  , with one study additionally including  sample s from Canada and the UK .  Three studies focused on aged adults , while six concentrated specifically on postmenopausal women . Forms of exercise or physical activity comprised self-reported exercise history in four studies and low , moderate or high intensity exercise interventions in five studies . Four studies  combined exercise with a hypocaloric diet  and included comparison groups receiving  either diet only , health education , stretching or a delayed intervention  ( one study each ) . Exercise was  associated with weight loss  ( 1.1 - 6 kg ) in all intervention studies , all of which studied an overweight sample , and  with weight maintenance  in most observational studies , all of which studied a general population or otherwise overweight-unspecific sample . In  sum , exercise and physical activity  can effectively  prevent weight gain  in  older adults and postmenopausal women  either in terms of weight loss or maintenance . They can  preserve lean body mass  and thus are important for the balance between potentially positive and negative effects of weight reduction in later life . In addition , since all intervention studies were conducted with an overweight sample , it seems that primordial prevention ( in terms of preventing the development of risk factors such as excess weight in the first place ) might be a neglected issue in geriatric and postmenopausal prevention."
"eThe target of diastolic  blood  pressure ( DBP ) remains controversial in  patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .  We systematic ally search ed PubMed / Medline and the Cochrane Central data base for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) assessing the efficacy and safety of reducing  DBP  in  CAD patients from January 1965 to July 2017 . Seven  placebo-controlled  RCTs enrolling 34,814 CAD patients who achieved DBP < 80 mmHg  were included in the drug-intervention group . The average  achieved blood pressures ( BPs )  were 126.3/75.1 and 131.5/77.8 mmHg in the drug-intervention and placebo-control groups , respectively . Drug intervention was associated with an 11 % reduction  in coronary revascularization  and a 31 %  reduction in heart failure .  In the drug-intervention group ,  all-cause death , myocardial infa rct ion , angina pectoris , and stroke  were reduced with marginal significance , whereas  hypotension  was increased by 123 % . A meta- analysis of four RCTs , in which the  achieved DBP  was < 75 mmHg , showed that the drug intervention was associated with a 22 % reduction  in heart failure .  These results suggest that reducing  DBP  to 80 mmHg or less would significantly  reduce coronary revascularization and heart failure  but at the expense of  causing hypotension  in  CAD patients .  Further trials are warranted to prove this issue."
"sBACKGROUND The response of status biomarkers to an increase in  iron  supply depends on several physiologic and environmental factors , which make it difficult to predict the outcome of an intervention . OBJECTIVE We assessed effects of baseline  iron  status , sex , menopausal status , duration of intervention , iron form , and daily dose on the change in  iron status  in response to  iron supplementation .  DESIGN A systematic review of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of   iron-supplementation and -fortification   trials that assessed effects on  hemoglobin , serum ferritin ( SF ) , soluble transferrin receptor , or body iron  was conducted . Subgrouping and straight-line and curved metaregression were used to describe the magnitude and dose-responsiveness of effect modifiers with respect to changes in status . RESULTS  Forty-one RCTs were included ;  none of the RCTs were judged at low risk of bias . R and om-effects meta-analyses showed that  iron supplementation  significantly improved  iron status  but with high levels of heterogeneity . Metaregression explained approximately one-quarter of between- study variance in effect size . There were clear effects  on SF  with study duration ( increase in SF concentration/wk : 0.51 μg/L ; 95 % CI : 0.02 , 1.00 μg/L ; P = 0.04 ) and dose ( increase in SF concentration/g Fe : 0.10 μg/L ; 95 % CI : 0.01 , 0.20 μg/L ; P = 0.036 ) and on  hemoglobin concentrations  with baseline iron status [ -0.08 g/dL ( 95 % CI : 0.15 , 0.00 g/dL ) per 10-μg/L increase in baseline SF concentration ; P = 0.02 ] . Insufficient data were available to assess effects  on body iron  ,  sex  , or menopausal  status  .  Quantitative relations between baseline iron status , study duration , and iron dose on  changes in iron-status biomarkers  , which were generated from the meta-analyses , can be used to predict effects of trials of  iron supplementation and fortification  and to design iron-intervention programs."
"sBathing  in water ( balneotherapy or spa therapy )  has been frequently and widely used in classical medicine as a cure for diseases . This paper review s the present literature on the use of  balneotherapy  in  dermatologic , chronic musculoskeletal ( inflammatory and non-inflammatory ) , metabolic and psychological conditions .  We performed a systematic review on related papers appearing in the  Medline and Cochrane Library data base from 1966 to 2003  that included r and  omized  controlled  and non-r  and  omized  clinical trials using  balneotherapy .  We also determined to reflect where possible the chemical compositions of  spas .  The major dermatologic and musculoskeletal diseases that are frequently treated by  balneotherapy  with a remarkable rate of success are atopic dermatitis , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , ankylosing  spondylitis  , osteoarthritis and  low back pain  . Moreover , the effects of  spa therapy  on several  metabolic conditions  are discussed . The mechanisms by which broad spectrums of diseases respond to  spa therapy  probably incorporate  chemical , thermal and mechanical effects .  The importance of  balneotherapy  either alone or as complement to other therapies should be considered after , or accompanying ,  orthodox  medical treatments."
"sGreen  tea catechins ( GTCs )  are known to improve  fat oxidation ( FOX )  during fasted , rested and exercise conditions wherein  epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG )  is thought to be the most pharmacologically active and has been studied extensively . From the available data of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on  EGCG  , we carried out a systematic review and meta- analysis to eluci date whether  EGCG  consumption indeed increase  energy expenditure ( EE )  and promote  FOX .  A systematic review of the literature was conducted using electronic data bases ( PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , CINAHL , JICST , JSTPLUS , and JMEDPLUS and others )  and eight RCTs were included .  RCTs were review ed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines and method ological quality was assessed . After data extraction , results were aggregated using fixed- and r and om-effect approaches and expressed to quantify the relationship between the dose of  EGCG  for  respiratory quotient ( RQ ) , EE  and  rate of FOX  to compare the  EGCG and placebo  treatments . The meta- analysis results of verities of studies in terms of dose and length of duration revealed that  EGCG  supplementation provided  significant mean difference ( MD )  when compared with  placebo  for  RQ  [ MD : -0.02 ; 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) , -0.04 to 0.00 ; I2=67 % ; P=.01 ] and  EE  [ MD : 158.05 kJ/day ; 95 % CI , 4.72 to 311.38 ; I2=0 % ; P=.04 ] in fixed-effect approach .  Changes in FOX  did not reach the level of statistical significance . Meta-analyses of  EGCG  influence on the  body mass index , waist circumference and total body fat mass ( TBFM )  were also examined and their impact on the  promotion of FOX  is reported . Effect of  EGCG  doses was also systematic ally review ed . Finding showed that  EGCG  intake moderately  accelerates EE and reduces RQ .  The analyses revealed that the  EGCG  result ed in difference  in RQ and EE  but the effect on the  other measures of energy metabolism  was relatively mild . Possibly ,  EGCG  alone has the potential to increase  metabolic rate  at 300 mg dose . Collectively , the outcome supports the findings that  EGCG  has an effect on  metabolic parameters .  However , the large prospect i ve trials are needed to confirm the findings."
" Overall , there is limited evidence suggesting that  HRLAs  are  cost-effective  in terms of changing health-related knowledge , behaviours or health outcomes . The evidence that does exist indicates that  HRLAs  are only  cost-effective  when they target behaviours likely to have a large impact on overall health-related quality of life . Further  development of HRLA interventions  needs to target specific population health needs where potential exists for significant improvement , and include rigorous evaluation to ensure that  HRLAs  provide sufficient value for money."
"yNighttime blood pressure strongly predicts  cardiovascular events ( CVEs ) .  Further , a preliminary trial has shown decreased  CVEs  from evening vs morning  dosing of antihypertensive therapy .  Is there additional evidence for evening dosing ? The authors systematic ally classified all  hypertension trials  as   evening dosing trials  (  EDTs   )  or  usual dosing trials   ( UDTs ) . Meta-analyses provided st and ardized hazard  ratios  for  CVEs  for EDTs ( HREDT s ) and UDTs ( HRUDT s ) . HREDT s /HRUDT s gave the  relative risk ( RR )  from evening vs usual  dosing .   Among 175 trials , 5 EDTs were discovered .  The  RR for CVEs  ( 95 % confidence limits ) from  evening  vs  usual dosing  was 0.63 ( 0.43 - 0.92 ; P=.016 ) . After adjustment for drug class , the RR was 0.54 ( 0.34 - 0.85 ; P=.008 ) . Unlike other EDTs , the  Heart Outcomes Prevention  Evaluation ( HOPE ) study administered its entire antihypertensive dose prior to sleep and gave the greatest  risk reduction .  This study provides a third type of evidence suggesting a  beneficial effect  from evening  dosing of antihypertensive therapy .  Head-to-head , multicenter trials are needed to test this strategy."
" Data concerning the implementation of the intervention are partially described in the articles retained . In this regard , a better description of the intervention provided and a more systematic evaluation of its implementation seem necessary to detect the subtle differences in the effects of the intervention."
">Abstract This systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) was conducted to summarize the effect of  resveratrol  intake  on  weight loss  .  We search ed the following data bases until July 2018 : MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) . Out of  831 reports , 36 RCTs were eligible for including to our meta- analysis  . The pooled results , using r and om-effects model showed  that resveratrol supplementation  significantly  decreased body weight  ( SMD = −0.17 ; 95 % CI , −0.33 , −0.01 ; P = 0.03 ; I2 : 62.6 ) ,  body mass index ( BMI  ) ( SMD = −0.20 ; 95 % CI , −0.35 , −0.05 ; P = 0.01 ; I2 : 60.6  ) , fat mass  ( SMD = −0.32 ; 95 % CI , −0.62 , −0.03 ; P = 0.03 ; I2 : 77.9 )  and waist circumference ( WC  ) ( SMD = −0.42 ; 95 % CI , −0.68 , −0.16 ; P = 0.001 ; I2 : 75.2 ) , and  significantly increased lean mass  ( SMD = 1.21 ; 95 % CI , 0.75 , 1.67 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 : 87.6 ) . We found no significant  effect of  resveratrol   administration  on leptin  ( SMD = −0.20 ; 95 % CI , −0.68 , 0.27 ; P = 0.40 ; I2 :  85.3 ) and adiponectin levels  ( SMD = 0.08 ; 95 % CI , −0.39 , 0.55 ; P = 0.74 ; I2 :  91.0 ) .  Resveratrol  supplementation significantly decreased body weight  in obese patients   ( SMD −0.43 ; 95 % CI , −0.60 , −0.26 ) compared with other  diseases  ( SMD 0.02 ; 95 % CI , −0.29 , 0.33 ) , and  type 2 diabetes mellitus  ( SMD −0.17 ; 95 % CI , −0.37 , 0.02 ) . Overall , the current meta- analysis demonstrated  that resveratrol  intake  significantly reduced weight , BMI , WC and fat mass  , and  significantly increased lean mass  , but did  not affect leptin and adiponectin levels ."
 Vitamin D  supplementation did  not improve EF  . The  significant effect of vitamin D  in diabetics and a tendency for an association with BMI may indicate a role of excess adiposity and insulin resistance in modulating the  effects of vitamin D  on vascular function . This remains to be tested in future studies.
"sHistorically  , low-carbohydrate ( CHO ) and very-low-CHO diets  have been used for  weight  loss  .  Recently , these diets have been promoted for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) management . This scientific statement provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence base available from recent systematic review s and meta-analyses on the effects of  low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets  on  body weight , lipoprotein lipids , glycemic control ,  and  other cardiometabolic risk factors .  In addition , evidence on emerging risk factors and potential safety concerns of  low-CHO and very-low-CHO  diets , especially for  high-risk individuals , such as those with genetic lipid disorders  , was review ed . Based on the evidence review ed  , low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets  are not superior to other dietary approaches for weight loss  .  These diets may have advantages related to  appetite control , triglyceride reduction , and reduction in the use of medication  in T2D management . The evidence review ed showed mixed effects on  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  with some studies showing an increase . There was no clear evidence for advantages regarding effects on other  cardiometabolic risk markers .  Minimal data are available regarding long-term ( > 2 years )  efficacy  and  safety .  Clinicians are encouraged to consider the evidence discussed in this scientific statement when counseling patients on the use of low-CHO and very-low-CHO diets."
"nBackground The twelve-item  Self-Report Habit Index ( SRHI  ) is the most popular measure of energy-balance related habits . This measure characterises habit by automatic activation , behavioural frequency , and relevance to self-identity . Previous empirical research suggests that the SRHI may be abbreviated with no losses in reliability or predictive utility . Drawing on recent theorising suggesting that automaticity is the ‘ active ingredient ’ of habit-behaviour relationships , we tested whether an automaticity-specific SRHI subscale could capture habit-based behaviour patterns in self-report data . Methods A content validity task was undertaken to identify a subset of automaticity indicators within the SRHI . The  reliability , convergent  validity and predictive validity of the automaticity item subset was subsequently tested in secondary analyses of all previous SRHI applications , identified via systematic review , and in primary analyses of four raw data sets relating to energy‐balance relevant behaviours ( inactive travel , active travel , snacking , and alcohol consumption ) . Results A four-item automaticity subscale ( the ‘ Self-Report  Behavioural Automaticity Index  ’ ; ‘ SRBAI ’ ) was found to be reliable and sensitive to two hypothesised effects of habit on behaviour : a  habit-behaviour  correlation , and a moderating effect of habit on the intention-behaviour relationship . Conclusion The SRBAI offers a parsimonious measure that adequately captures habitual behaviour patterns . The SRBAI may be of particular utility in predicting future behaviour and in studies tracking habit formation or disruption."
"e& NA ; A growing body of evidence suggests that our diet is an important contributing factor in the development , management and prevention of a number of psychiatric illnesses . Tryptophan , an essential amino acid , is the sole precursor of neurotransmitter 5‐hydroxytryptamine ( 5‐HT ; serotonin ) . Administration of tryptophan can boost serotonin neurotransmission to produce therapeutically important effects in serotonin deficiency disorders .  Anorexia nervosa ( AN )  an eating disorder associated with high levels of psychiatric comorbidity including psychosis , hyperactivity , depression and anxiety has highest lethality of all psychiatric illnesses . Evidence suggests that excessive dieting and food restriction can  decrease brain tryptophan and serotonin  in  AN  patients to precipitate depression , psychosis and hyperactivity . There are currently no FDA approved pharmacological treatments available for AN patients ; antidepressants and antipsychotics , largely used to treat associated psychiatric comorbidities are also not very effective . The aim of this non‐ systematic review article is to evaluate and document a potential importance of  tryptophan  supplementation in improving therapeutics in AN patients .

"sThis systematic review and meta- analysis aims to compare the effect of  High-Glycemic Index ( GI ) versus Low-GI breakfasts  on  cognitive functions  , including  memory and attention  , of  children and adolescents .  We systematic ally search ed the MEDLINE ( via PubMed ) , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ,  Cochrane  Data base  of  Systematic Review s ,  and Web of Science data bases  , from their inception until June 2019  . Articles  comparing the effect of   Low-GI versus High-GI  breakfasts  on the  cognitive function  ( i.e. ,  immediate memory , delayed memory , and attention )  of  children and adolescents were included .   The DerSimonian and Laird method  was used to  compute the pooled effect sizes ( ESs )  and  their  respective  95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) .  The  pooled ESs  were 0.13 ( 95 % CI : -0.11 , 0.37 ) for  immediate memory  and 0.07 ( 95 % CI : -0.15 , 0.28 ) for  delayed memory .  For  attention  , the pooled ES was -0.01 ( 95 % CI : -0.27 , 0.26 ) . In summary ,  GI breakfasts  do  not affect cognitive domains  in children and adolescents."
"sObjective  Irrigant activation  has been cl aim ed to be beneficial in in vitro and clinical studies . This systematic review aims to investigate the clinical efficiency of  mechanically activated irrigants and conventional irrigation .  Methods A literature search ( PROSPERO registration number : CRD42018112595 ) was undertaken in PubMed , Cochrane and h and search . The inclusion criteria were clinical trials , in vivo/ex vivo on  adult permanent teeth  involving an  active irrigation device  and a control group of  conventional irrigation .  The exclusion criteria were  studies done in vitro , animals and foreign language . Adult patients requiring endodontic treatment of permanent dentition and  irrigant activation  during the treatment were  chosen as the participants and intervention respectively . Results After removal of duplicates ,  89 articles were obtained , and 72 were excluded as they did not meet the selection criteria  . 6 devices  ( EndoVac , EndoActivator , Ultrasonic , MDA ( manual dynamic agitation ) , CUI ( Continuous Ultrasonic Irrigation ) and PUI ( Passive Ultrasonic Irrigation ) )  and 6 variables of interest  ( Post-operative pain , periapical healing , antibacterial efficacy , canal and /or isthmus cleanliness , debridement efficacy and delivery up to working length )  were evaluated in the 17 included articles . The risk of bias and quality of the selected articles were moderate . Results showed that  mechanical active irrigation  reduces  post-operative pain .  It improved  debridement , canal/isthmus cleanliness .  It also improved  delivery of irrigant up to working length . Bacterial count  was more with  active irrigation  , though not significant . There is no effect on  long-term periapical healing .  Conclusion It may be concluded that  mechanical active irrigation devices  are beneficial in reducing  post-operative pain  and improving  canal and isthmus cleanliness  during Endodontics."
" Relatively long- duration lifestyle interventions can limit or delay progression  to  diabetes under trial conditions . However , outcomes from more time-limited interventions , and those applied in routine clinical setting s , appear more variable , in keeping with the findings of recent pragmatic trials . There is little evidence of intervention impact  on vascular outcomes or mortality end  points in any context . ' Real-world ' implementation of  lifestyle  interventions for diabetes prevention may be expected to lead to modest outcomes."
"sObese  patients have  an  increased  prevalence of   cardiovascular ( CV )  risk factors  , which improve with  bariatric surgery  , but whether  bariatric surgery  reduces long-term  CV events  remains ill defined . A systematic review of published research was conducted , and CV risk models were applied in a validation cohort previously published . A st and ardized MEDLINE search using terms associated with obesity , bariatric surgery , and CV risk factors identified 6 test studies . The  validation  cohort consisted of  a population -based , historical cohort of 197 patients who underwent  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  and 163  control patients  , identified through the Rochester Epidemiology Project .  Framingham and Prospect i ve Cardiovascular Munster Heart Study ( PROCAM ) risk  scores  were applied to  calculate 10-year CV risk .  In the validation cohort ,  absolute 10-year Framingham risk score for CV events  was lower at follow-up in the  bariatric surgery  group ( 7.0 % to 3.5 % , p < 0.001 ) compared with controls ( 7.1 % to 6.5 % , p = 0.13 ) , with an intergroup absolute difference in risk reduction of 3 % ( p < 0.001 ) .  PROCAM risk  in the bariatric  surgery  group decreased from 4.1 % to 2.0 % ( p < 0.001 ) , whereas the control group exhibited only a modest decrease ( 4.4 % to 3.8 % , p = 0.08 ) . Using mean data from the validation study , the trend and directionality in risk was similar in the Roux-en-Y group . The test studies confirmed the directionality of  CV risk  , with estimated  relative risk reductions  for  bariatric surgery  patients ranging from 18 % to 79 % using the Framingham  risk  score compared with 8 % to 62 % using the PROCAM risk score . In conclusion ,  bariatric surgery  predicts long-term decreases in  CV risk  in obese patients."
">The effects of  telemedicine strategies  on the  management of diabetes  is not clear . This study aim ed to investigate the impact of different  telemedicine strategies  on  glycaemic control management  of  type 2 diabetes patients .  A search was performed in  6 data bases  from inception  until September 2016  for  r and omized  controlled studies that examined the use of   telemedicine  in adults with type 2 diabetes .  Studies were independently extracted and classified according to the following  telemedicine strategies : teleeducation , telemonitoring , telecase-management , telementoring and teleconsultation .  Traditional and network meta- analysis were performed to estimate the relative treatment effects .  A total of 107 studies involving 20,501 participants were included .  Over a median of 6 months follow-up  , telemedicine   reduced haemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c )  by a mean of 0.43 % ( 95 % CI : −0.64 % to −0.21 % ) . Network meta- analysis showed that all  telemedicine  strategies were  effective  in  reducing HbA1c  significantly compared to usual care except for  telecase-management  and   telementoring   , with mean difference ranging from 0.37 % and 0.71 % . Ranking indicated that  teleconsultation  was the most  effective   telemedicine  strategy , followed by  telecase-management  plus  telemonitoring  , and finally  teleeducation  plus  telecase-management .  The review indicates that most  telemedicine  strategies can be useful , either as an adjunct or to replace usual care , leading to clinical ly meaningful  reduction in HbA1c ."

"sThe aim of this systematic review was to determine the attitudes and beliefs of  doctors to acute low back pain  , and the factors that influence these . The review comprised three phases : a method ological assessment of data bases ( Medline , EMBASE , Psychinfo , BIOSIS , CINAHL , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) identified potential papers ; these were screened for inclusion criteria by two independent review ers , the extraction of data and the rating of internal validity and strength of the evidence , using valid and reliable scales from accepted papers . Themes were then identified from the accepted literature . The search generated a total of  15 papers of both qualitative ( n=3 ) and quantitative ( n=12 ) method  ologies . Themes that emerged included doctors ' attitudes and beliefs , and four factors that influenced attitudes and beliefs : doctors ' specialty , demographic factors , personal beliefs and education . There was consistent evidence that doctors ' specialty impacted their attitudes and beliefs : lack of consensus regarding the natural history of LBP , around treatment options , and issues regarding work . There was inconsistent evidence that  demographic factors  ( age ) and level of education impacted doctors ' attitudes and beliefs . Strategies to address/ modify these attitudes and beliefs are required , as in some cases they are at odds with guideline recommendations . Long term , these changes in these areas have the potential to  maximise patient-care  , and reduce costs to health services."

Result Of the  1996 articles retrieved , seven studies ranging in date of publication from 1998 to 2013 met the inclusion criteria  ,  allowing data extraction on 484 participants with an age range of 40 to 82 years .  Interventions lasted from 4 weeks to 12 months and the results across studies showed significant  increases in step count  ( p < 0.05 ) following the intervention . Across these studies , there was a  mean increase in PA  of 1950 steps per day relative to baseline . Four studies reported  improved scores for pain and /or physical function  at the intervention completion point relative to controls . Conclusion This study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness  of pedometer walking interventions  in increasing PA levels for  patients with MSDs .  Our findings suggest that a combination of interventions is likely to be the most effective strategy to maximize health benefits in the short term . Further research should include larger sample sizes , and longer intervention duration s are required to support the role of  pedometer walking interventions  as a long term intervention for management of musculoskeletal disorders."
"sThe objective of this study is to provide a critical overview of available instruments to assess impairments in  patients with rheumatic disorders  , and to recommend reliable and valid instruments for use in allied health care and rehabilitation medicine . A computer-aided literature search ( 1982–2004 ) in several data bases was performed to identify studies focusing on the clinimetric properties of instruments design ed to assess impairments in function in  patients with rheumatic disorders .  Data on  intra-rater reliability , inter-rater reliability and construct validity  were extracted in a st and ardized way . Explicit criteria were applied for reliability and validity . Results : The search identified a total of  49 instruments to  assess impairments in functions  in patients with rheumatic disorders ;  19 met the criteria for reliability , 22 met the criteria for validity , and 11 out of the 49 appeared to meet the criteria for both reliability and validity . In summary , evidence of  both reliability and validity  was only found for 11 out of 49 instruments for the assessment of impairments in  patients with rheumatic disorders .  Only a limited number of the identified instruments for the  assessment of impairments  is both reliable and valid . Allied health care professionals should be cautious in the selection of measurement instruments to assess their patients."
"  Early life , income , and health insurance interventions  have the potential to  improve health .  However , many of the included studies were underpowered to detect health effects and were at high or moderate risk of bias . Future  social policy experiments  should be better design ed to measure the association between interventions and  health outcomes ."

 Reporting of SEP trials was poor with regard to the numbers of subjects screened and reasons for exclusions . Only approximately 1 in 3 screened  IC patients  was suitable for and willing to undertake SEP . Levels of adherence to SEPs and definitions of satisfactory adherence were also lacking in most the current literature . Current clinical guidelines based on this evidence base may not be applicable to most  IC patients  and changes to SEPs may be needed to encourage and /or retain participants.
"-STUDY DESIGN Systematic literature review and meta- analysis . OBJECTIVE To evaluate studies that used  arthritis self-management education alone or with exercise  to improve  Arthritis Self-Efficacy  Scale scores of  patients with knee osteoarthritis .  BACKGROUND Increasing self-efficacy may improve  patient knee osteoarthritis symptom management and function .  METHODS MEDLINE ( 1946-March 2013 ) , CINAHL ( 1981-March 2013 ) , and PsycINFO ( 1967-March 2013 ) data bases were search ed . RESULTS  Twenty-four studies , including 3163 subjects ( women , n = 2547 [ 80.5 % ] ; mean ± SD age , 65.3 ± 6.5 years ) , met the inclusion criteria .  A meta- analysis was performed to compare the st and ardized mean difference  effect sizes  ( Cohen d ) of r and omized controlled studies that used the  Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale pain  ( 13 studies , n = 1906 ) , other symptoms ( 13 studies , n = 1957 ) , and function ( 5 studies , n = 399 ) subscales  . Cohen d effect sizes  were also calculated for cohort studies that used  the Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale pain  ( 10 studies , n = 1035 ) , other symptoms ( 9 studies , n = 913 ) , and function ( 3 studies , n = 141 ) subscales . Both r and omized controlled studies and cohort studies were grouped by intervention type  ( intervention 1 , arthritis self-management education alone ; intervention 2 , arthritis self-management education with exercise )  , and effect sizes were compared ( Mann-Whitney U tests , P<.05 ) . Interventions that  used arthritis self-management education with exercise   displayed higher method ological quality scale scores  ( 76.8 ± 13.1 versus 61.6 ± 19.6 , P = .03 ) . Statistically significant st and ardized  effect-size  differences between intervention 1 and intervention 2 were not observed .   Small to moderate effect sizes  were observed regardless of whether the intervention  included exercise . Exercise  interventions used in conjunction with arthritis  self-management  education programs need to be developed to better enhance  the self-efficacy  of  patients with knee osteoarthritis .

"sBackground The impact of sarcopenia on the outcome of  gastrointestinal ( GI ) oncological patients  is still controversial . We aim to discuss the prevalence of sarcopenia and its relation to the oncological outcome . Methods Embase , Medline , PubMed , and the Cochrane library were systematic ally search ed for related keywords . Studies using  CT  to assess sarcopenia and evaluate its relationship with the outcome of  GI oncological patients  were included . Long-term outcomes , including  overall survival and disease-free survival  , were compared by hazard ratios ( HRs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) . Short-term outcomes ,  including total complications and major complications ( Clavien-Dindo ≥IIIa ) after curable surgery  , were compared by the risk ratio ( RR ) and 95 % CI . Results  A total of 70 studies including 21,875 patients were included in our study .  The median incidence of  sarcopenia  was 34.7 % ( range from 2.1 to 83.3 % ) . A total of 88.4 % of studies used  skeletal muscle index ( SMI )  in the third lumbar level on CT to define sarcopenia , and a total of 19 cut-offs were used to define sarcopenia . An increasing trend was found in the prevalence  of sarcopenia  when the cut-off of SMI increased ( β = 0.22 , 95 % CI = 0.12–0.33 , p < 0.001 ) . The preoperative incidence of sarcopenia was associated both with an  increased risk of overall mortality  ( HR = 1.602 , 95 % CI = 1.369–1.873 , P < 0.001 ) and  with disease-free mortality  ( HR = 1.461 , 95 % CI = 1.297–1.646 , P < 0.001 ) . Moreover , preoperative sarcopenia was a risk factor  for both total complications  ( RR = 1.188 , 95 % CI = 1.083–1.303 , P < 0.001 )  and major  complications ( RR = 1.228 , 95 % CI = 1.042–1.448 , P = 0.014 ) . Conclusion The prevalence of sarcopenia depends mostly on the diagnostic cut-off points of different criteria . Preoperative sarcopenia is a risk factor for both long-term and short-term outcomes."
" The effects of treatment with  clomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (  SSRIs  : fluvoxamine , sertraline , fluoxetine , citalopram  , and  escitalopram )  proved to be similar , except for the lower adherence rate in case of clomipramine because of its side effects . An adequate drug trial involves administering an effective daily dose for a minimum of 8 weeks . An augmentation strategy proven effective for individuals refractory to monotherapy with SSRI treatment alone is the use of  atypical antipsychotics ( risperidone , olanzapine , and quetiapine )  . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE Administration of  fluvoxamine or sertraline  to patients for an adequate duration is recommended as the first-line prescription for OCD , and augmentation therapy with  risperidone , olanzapine  , or  quetiapine  is recommended for refractory OCD."

"nThe assessment of   root canal curvature   is essential for clinical and research purpose s. This systematic review presents an overview of the published techniques for the measurement of  root  canal  curvature features  using  imaging  and to provide a critique of their clinical application . A data base search in PubMed , PubMed Central , Embase , Scopus , EBSCO Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source and Virtual Health Library was conducted , using appropriate key words to identify measurement methods for root canal curvatures . The search strategy retrieved  10594 records in total , and 31 records fulfilled the inclusion criteria .  From  2D image acquisitions  , eleven studies measured exclusively the  angle of curvature  , an additional thirteen measured other  curvature features ( level , height , radius , length and shape  ) . Seven reports described methods from  3D imaging ( CBCT , μCT  )  . Root canal curvatures  should be measured , for clinical proposes , to facilitate endodontic treatment planning , and in research , to reduce the risk of selection bias . This review has revealed that there are many methods described in the literature ; however , no consensus exists on which method should be used . Some of the method ologies have potential clinical translation , whereas others are suitable for research purpose only , as they require a specific software or radiographic exposure in the mesiodistal direction."

"yWe aim ed to investigate the potential association between  vitamin D  and  serum  leptin levels by pooling together the results from observational studies and clinical trials . A systematic literature search of PubMed , Scopus and Google Scholar was conducted up to March 2015 . The analysis of observational studies was conducted on  six  papers that reported nine correlation coefficients using Fisher ’s Z and its st and ard error . Then , effect sizes of eligible trials were pooled using r and om-effects models ( the DerSimonian-Laird estimator ) . Results of observational studies showed an inverse  association between leptin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D )  ( Fisher ’s Z=−0.93 , 95 % CI : −0.95 , −0.91 ) . After combining trials  , pooled mean difference ( PMD )  for 25(OH)D was 24.06 ng/ml ( 95 % CI , 17.27–30.85 ; P<0.001 ) with significant heterogeneity among studies ( P<0.001 ; I2=89.1 % ) . Raising 25(OH)D was associated with significant  increase in leptin level  ( PMD=4.60 ng/ml , 95 % CI , 0.55–8.66 , P=0.026 ) with significant heterogeneity ( P<0.001 ; I2=96.4 % ) .  Population with diabetes ( PMD : 13.63 ng/ml )  ,  age younger than 50 years ( PMD : 1.884 ng/ml )  , doses less than 1000  IU/day  ( PMD  : 1.53 ng/ml  ) , duration less than  24 weeks  ( PMD : 14.668 ng/ml ) and baseline 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l ( PMD : 13.483 ng/ml ) were sources of heterogeneity . Current evidence indicates that  inverse association between leptin level and 25(OH)D concentration  was observed in observational studies , which was not demonstrated in intervention studies with high heterogeneity . Clearly , there is a need for properly design ed and large prospect i ve dose – response trials with long-term follow-up to assess the sources of heterogeneity."
"nBackground  Vitamin D  is essential for maintaining optimal bone health . The prevalence of  vitamin D  inadequacy  in athletes  is currently unclear . Objective The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of  vitamin  D  inadequacy in athletes .  Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis . Multiple data bases were search ed and studies assessing  serum   25-hydroxyvitamin  D  [  25(OH)D  ] status in athletes  were identified . Serum 25(OH)D is measured to clinical ly determine vitamin D status . Review ers independently selected the eligible articles , assessed the method ological quality , and extracted data . Disagreements were resolved by consensus . Weighted  proportions of  vitamin D  inadequacy [ serum 25(OH)D  < 32 ng/mL ] were calculated ( DerSimonian – Laird r and om-effects model ) and compared using Chi-squared ( χ2 ) test . Subgroup analyses were conducted and risk ratios ( RRs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were reported . Results  Twenty-three studies with 2,313 athletes [ mean ( st and ard deviation ) age 22.5 ( 5.0 ) years , 76 % male ] were included . Of 2,313 athletes  , 56 % ( 44–67  % )  had vitamin D inadequacy   that significantly varied by geographical location ( p < 0.001 ) . It was significantly higher in the  UK  and in the  Middle  East . The risk significantly increased for winter and spring seasons ( RR 1.85 ; 95 % CI 1.27–2.70 ) , indoor sport activities ( RR 1.19 ; 95 % CI 1.09–1.30 ) , and mixed sport activities ( RR 2.54 ; 95 % CI 1.03–6.26 ) . The risk was slightly higher for > 40 ° N latitude [ RR 1.14 ( 95 % CI 0.91–1.44 ) ] but it increased significantly [ RR 1.85 ( 1.35–2.53 ) ] after excluding the Middle East as an outlier .  Seven studies with 359 athletes  reported injuries .  The prevalence of injuries in athletes  was 43 % ( 95 % CI 20–68 ) [ bone related = 19 % ( 95 % CI 7–36 ) ; muscle and soft-tissue = 37.5 % ( 95 % CI 11.5–68.5 ) ] . Conclusion Despite the limitations of the current evidence , the prevalence of  vitamin  D inadequacy in  athletes  is prominent . The risk significantly increases in higher latitudes , in winter and early spring seasons , and for indoor sport activities . Regular investigation of  vitamin D  status using reliable assays and supplementation is essential to ensure  healthy athletes .  The prevalence of injuries in  athletes  is notable but its association with   vitamin D  status  is unclear . A well- design ed longitudinal study is needed to answer this possible association."
 The available evidence suggests that antidepressants are superior to  placebo  in treating  GAD .  There is evidence from one trial suggesting that  paroxetine  and  imipramine  have a  similar efficacy and tolerability .  There is also evidence from placebo-controlled trials suggesting that these drugs  are well tolerated by  GAD patients .   Further trials of antidepressants for GAD will help to demonstrate which antidepressants should be used for which patients.
"sObjective : To assess the effectiveness of  aquatic physical therapy  in the treatment of  fibromyalgia .  Data sources : The search strategy was undertaken using the following data bases , from 1950 to December 2012 : MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , LILACS , SCIELO , WEB OF SCIENCE , SCOPUS , SPORTD iscus , Cochrane Library Controlled Trials Register , Cochrane Disease Group Trials Register , PEDro and DARE . Review methods : The studies were separated into groups : Group I –  aquatic physical therapy × no treatment  , Group  II – aquatic physical therapy × l and -based exercises  and  Group III – aquatic physical therapy × other treatments .  Results :  Seventy-two abstract s were found  ,  27 of which met  the inclusion criteria . For the  functional ability  ( Fibromyalgia Impact Question naire ) , three studies were considered with a treatment time of more than 20 weeks and a  mean difference ( MD )  of −1.35 [ −2.04 ; −0.67 ] , P = 0.0001 was found in favour of the  aquatic physical therapy  group versus no treatment . The same results were identified  for stiffness and the 6-minute walk test  where two studies were pooled with an MD of −1.58 [ −2.58 ; −0.58 ] , P = 0.002 and 43.5 ( metres ) [ 3.8 ; 83.2 ] , P = 0.03 , respectively . Conclusion : Three meta-analyses showed statistically significant results in favour of the  aquatic physical therapy   ( Fibromyalgia Impact Question naire , stiffness and the 6-minute walk test )  during a period of longer than 20 weeks . Due to the low method ological rigor , the results were insufficient to demonstrate statistical and clinical differences in most of the outcomes."
" drawn from this systematic review suggest that physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with  P3b modulation  during cognitive control and attention tasks .  Acute and chronic physical activity interventions  modulate  the P3b component  , suggesting short- and long-term functional adaptations occurring in the brain to support cognitive processes . These summary findings suggest physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are beneficial to brain function and that P3b may serve as a biomarker of covert attentional processes to better underst and the relationship of physical activity and cognition."
"nBackground The clinical effectiveness of  intensive lifestyle interventions  in preventing or delaying  diabetes in people at high risk  has been established from r and omised trials of structured , intensive interventions conducted in several countries over the past two decades . The challenge is to translate them into routine clinical setting s. The objective of this review is to determine whether  lifestyle interventions  delivered to  high-risk adult patients in routine clinical care setting  s are feasible and effective in achieving reductions in risk factors for  diabetes .  Methods Data sources : MEDLINE ( PubMed ) , EMBASE , CINAHL , The Cochrane Library , Google Scholar , and grey literature were search ed for  English- language articles published from January 1990 to August 2009 .  The reference lists of all articles collected were checked to ensure that no relevant suitable studies were missed . Study selection : We included RCTs , before/after evaluations , cohort studies with or without a control group and interrupted time series analyses of  lifestyle interventions  with the stated aim of diabetes risk reduction or diabetes prevention , conducted in routine clinical setting s and delivered by healthcare providers such as family physicians , practice nurses , allied health personnel , or other healthcare staff associated with a health service . Outcomes of interest were  weight loss , reduction in waist circumference , improvement of impaired fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) results , improvements in fat and fibre intakes , increased level of engagement in physical activity and reduction in diabetes incidence .  Results  Twelve from 41 potentially relevant studies  were included in the review . Four studies were suitable for meta- analysis . A significant positive effect of the interventions on  weight  was reported by all study types . The meta- analysis showed that lifestyle interventions achieved  weight and waist circumference reductions  after one year . However , no clear effects on biochemical or clinical parameters were observed , possibly due to short follow-up periods or lack of power of the studies meta-analysed . Changes in  dietary parameters or physical activity  were generally not reported . Most studies assessing feasibility were supportive of implementation of lifestyle interventions in routine clinical care . Conclusion  Lifestyle interventions  for  patients at high risk of diabetes  , delivered by a variety of healthcare providers in routine clinical setting s , are feasible but appear to be of limited clinical benefit one year after intervention . Despite convincing evidence from structured intensive trials , this systematic review showed that translation into routine practice has less effect on diabetes risk reduction."
"gTaking  performance-enhancing drugs ( PEDs )  can cause serious and irreversible health consequences , which can ultimately lead to premature death . Some  young people  may take  PEDs  without fully underst and ing the ramifications of their actions or based on the advice from others . The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the main factors that predicted  doping among young people .  The literature was systematic ally review ed using search engines , manually search ing specialist journals , and pearl growing .  Fifty-two studies , which included 187,288 young people aged between 10 and 21 years of age , 883 parents of adolescent athletes , and 11 adult coaches , who were interviewed regarding young athletes , were included in this review .  Nine factors predicted doping among young people : gender ; age ; sports participation ; sport type ; psychological variables ; entourage ; ethnicity ; nutritional supplements ; and health harming behaviors . In regards to psychological variables , 22 different constructs were associated with doping among young people . Some psychological constructs were negatively associated with doping ( e.g. ,  self-esteem , resisting social pressure , and perfectionist strivings )  , whereas other were positively associated with doping ( e.g. ,  suicide risk , anticipated regret , and aggression )  . Policy makers and National Anti-Doping Organizations could use these findings to help identify athletes who are more at risk of doping and then expose these individuals to anti-doping education . Based on the current findings , it also appears that education programs should commence at the onset of adolescence or even late childhood , due to the young age in which some individuals start doping."

"yChildren obesity is considered a serious public health problem around the world . In Spain , the prevalence of overweight/obesity is reaching alarming figures , exceeding 35 % of the  children .  Several hypotheses suggest that the energy balance model does not fit very well when analyzing the causes of the current obesity epidemic and , although genetics seems to explain up to 30 % of the likelihood to become obese in infancy , has been suggested that genetics might be influenced by environment factors including  vigorous physical activity  ( PA ) . Some recent systematic review s indicate that there is enough evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent  obesity in children 6 - 12 years old ;  however , the heterogeneity of the effect , and the potential selection , information and publication biases that undermine the validity of these studies , thus their results should be interpreted with caution . In Spain , an  extracurricular PA program of leisuretime ( MOVI )  has evidence d some effectiveness on  reducing the adiposity  and on  improving the lipid profile  in  schoolchildren  . To overcome some weakness of  MOVI program  , a second edition of this study was design ed . The objectives of this review are twofold : 1 ) to analyze latest data of the obesity epidemic in  Spain ;  and 2 ) to describe the main features of  MOVI-2 program  , and overall of the successful interventions to prevent children obesity."
"nAbstract Background : The role of  probiotics  in the treatment of  atopic dermatitis ( AD )  remains controversial . A recent systematic review of the available evidence called for further clinical trials with new probiotic formulations . Objective : To assess the clinical efficacy and impact of  Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 , Bifidobacterium lactis UABLA-12 with fructo-oligosaccharide  on peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in  preschool children with moderate-to-severe AD .  Method : R and omized , double-blind ,  placebo-controlled  , prospect i ve trial of  90 children aged 1–3 years with moderate-to-severe AD  who were treated with a mixture  of L. acidophilus DDS-1 , B. lactis UABLA-12 with fructo-oligosaccharide at a dosage of 5 billion colony-forming units twice daily  for  8 weeks versus placebo .  The primary outcome measure was the  percentage change in Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) value .  Other outcome measures were  changes in Infant Dermatitis Quality Of Life ( IDQOL ) and Dermatitis Family Impact ( DFI ) scores , frequency and amount of topical corticosteroid used , and lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood measured by laser flow cytometry  . Results : At the final visit , the percentage  decrease in SCORAD  was 33.7 % in the probiotic group compared with 19.4 % in the placebo group ( p = 0.001 ) . Children receiving probiotic showed a greater decrease in  the mean [ SD ] SCORAD score  than did children from the placebo group at week 8 ( −14.2 [ 9.9 ] vs −7.8 [ 7.7 ] , respectively ;  p  =  0.001 ) . IDQOL and DFI scores  decreased significantly from baseline by 33.0 % and 35.2 % in the probiotic group and by 19.0 % and 23.8 % in the placebo group , respectively ( p = 0.013 , p = 0.010 ) .  Use of topical corticosteroids  during the 8-week trial period averaged 7.7 g less in probiotic patients  ( p  =  0.006 ) . CD3 , CD16 , and CD22 lymphocyte subsets  remained unchanged , whereas the percentage of  CD4  , and the percentage and absolute count of  CD25  decreased , and the percentage and absolute count of CD8 increased in the probiotic group at week 8 ( p < 0.007 vs placebo ) . There was a significant correlation  between CD4 percentage , CD25 percentage , CD25 absolute count , and SCORAD values  ( r = 0.642 , r = 0.746 , r = 0.733 , respectively ; p < 0.05 ) in the probiotic group at week 8 . Conclusion : The administration of a  probiotic mixture containing L. acidophilus DDS-1 , B. lactis UABLA-  12 , and fructo-oligosaccharide was associated with  significant clinical improvement  in  children with AD  , with corresponding lymphocyte subset changes in peripheral blood . The efficacy of  probiotic therapy  in  adults with  AD requires further investigation."

"DThe  Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension ( DASH )  is recommended to lower  blood pressure ( BP )  , but its effects on cardiometabolic biomarkers are unclear . A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) was conducted to determine the effects of the  DASH diet  on cardiovascular risk factors . Medline , Embase and Scopus data bases were search ed from inception to December 2013 . Inclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 )  DASH diet ;  ( 2 ) RCT ; ( 3 )  risk factors including systolic and diastolic BP and glucose , HDL , LDL , TAG and total cholesterol concentrations  ; ( 4 ) control group . R and om-effects models were used to determine the pooled effect sizes . Meta-regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between  effect sizes , baseline values of the risk factors , BMI  , age , quality of trials , salt intake and study duration .  A total of twenty articles reporting data for 1917 participants were included in the meta- analysis .  The duration of interventions ranged from 2 to 24 weeks  . The  DASH diet was found to result in  significant decreases in systolic BP  ( - 5·2 mmHg , 95 % CI - 7·0 , - 3·4 ;  P < 0·001 ) and diastolic BP  ( - 2·6 mmHg , 95 % CI - 3·5 , - 1·7 ;  P < 0·001 ) and in the concentrations of total cholesterol  ( - 0·20 mmol/l , 95 % CI - 0·31 , - 0·10 ;  P < 0·001 ) and  LDL ( - 0·10 mmol/l , 95 % CI - 0·20 ,  - 0·01 ; P= 0·03 ) . Changes in both systolic and diastolic BP  were greater in  participants with  higher baseline  BP or BMI .  These changes predicted a reduction of approximately 13 %  in the 10-year Framingham risk score for CVD   . The  DASH diet  improved cardiovascular risk  factors and appeared to have greater beneficial effects in subjects with an increased cardiometabolic risk .  The  DASH diet is an effective nutritional strategy to prevent CVD."

"nA systematic review was undertaken to examine all available evidence to develop and support clinical recommendations regarding the use of  fulvestrant ( Faslodex ® )  as systemic therapy of  locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women .  MEDLINE , EMBASE , American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting proceedings , San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposia proceedings , and the Cochrane Library were search ed through to April of 2008 for reports of r and omized controlled trials that met established inclusion criteria . Four relevant Phase III trials were available for inclusion based on established criteria . Three of four Phase III superiority trials found  no significant difference between fulvestrant and control  ,  either  anastrozole   or   exemestane   ,  across efficacy and safety endpoints  following prior endocrine therapy failure , with two trials further confirming  non-inferiority  of fulvestrant to anastrozole retrospectively . Fulvestrant can therefore be considered as alternative therapy to anastrozole or exemestane in  postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has recurred on prior adjuvant endocrine therapy or progressed on prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease .  There are , however , important method ological concerns across review ed trials that should be taken under consideration as they may limit the strength of such a conclusion."

"eThe suitable duration of  antibiotic use  following  appendectomy  for  advanced appendicitis in children  is still debated . A systematic review was performed , including published experimental and observational data of  antibiotic use  in  children who had undergone appendectomy for advanced appendicitis .  Data were extracted and analyzed according to predefined criteria .  Twenty-eight studies were selected that included 2,284 patients .  There was no consistency among the protocol s regarding  length of antibiotic use , discharge criteria  , or  use of home antibiotics  following discharge . Limiting duration of antibiotic use to3 days did not appear to be associated with higher  rates of intraabdominal abscess or wound infection .  In the absence of higher-level evidence , shortening of antibiotic regimens following surgery for pediatric complicated appendicitis appears to be safe."

"8AIMS Evidence to support  dietary modifications  to improve glycemia during pregnancy is limited , and the benefits of diet beyond limiting gestational weight gain is unclear . Therefore , a systematic review and network meta- analysis of r and omized trials was conducted to compare the effects of various  common diets  , stratified by the  addition of gestational weight gain advice  , on fasting glucose and insulin , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) in  pregnant women .  METHODS MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane data base , and reference lists of published studies were search ed through April 2017 .  R and omized trials directly comparing  two  or  more diets  for ≥2-weeks  were eligible . Bayesian network meta- analysis was performed for fasting glucose . Owing to a lack of similar dietary comparisons , a st and ard pairwise meta- analysis for the other glycemic outcomes was performed . The certainty of the pooled effect estimates was assessed using the GRADE tool . RESULTS  Twenty-one trials ( 1,865 participants ) were included .  In general , when given  alongside gestational weight gain advice , fasting glucose  improved in most diets compared to diets that gave gestational weight gain advice only .  However , fasting glucose  increased in high unsaturated or monounsaturated fatty acids diets . In the  absence of gestational weight gain advice , fasting glucose  improved in DASH-style diets compared to st and ard of care . Although most were non-significant , similar trends were observed for these same diets for the  other  glycemic outcomes . Dietary comparisons ranged from moderate to very low in quality of evidence .  /INTERPRETATION Alongside with  gestational  weight gain advice , most diets , with the exception of a high unsaturated or a high monounsaturated fatty acid diet ,  demonstrated a fasting glucose  improvement compared with gestational weight gain advice only . When gestational weight gain advice was not given , the DASH-style diet appeared optimal on fasting glucose . However , a small number of trials were identified and most dietary comparisons were underpowered to detect differences in glycemic outcomes . Further studies that are high in quality and adequately powered are needed to confirm these findings . REGISTRATION PROSPERO CRD42015026008."
"tThe aim of this systematic review is to evaluate whether the use of  probiotics  has any effect on the components of metabolic syndrome ( MetS  ) before patients develop type 2 diabetes .  A qualitative systematic review , following the Cochrane methodology , and a comprehensive literature search of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) were conducted in PubMed and Scopus from inception until 4 July 2019 . According to our inclusion criteria ,  nine clinical studies were  finally  analyzed  , corresponding to  six  RCTs .  Probiotics intake  in  patients with MetS  result ed in improvements  in body mass index , blood pressure , glucose metabolism , and lipid profile  in some studies . Regarding  inflammatory biomarkers  , probiotics also positively affected  the soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( sVCAM-1 ) , interleukine-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF-α ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and thrombomodulin .  Despite the diversity of the published studies , the intake  of probiotics  for  patients with MetS  may offer a discrete improvement in some  of the clinical characteristics of the MetS  and a  decrease in inflammatory biomarkers  . Nevertheless , these beneficial effects seem to be marginal compared to drug therapy and a healthy lifestyle and clinical ly non-relevant."

"rAIM The effects of  nutrient-based treatments  ,  including adjunctive vitamin or antioxidant supplementation  , have been explored extensively in long-term schizophrenia  .  However , no systematic evaluation of trials in  "" first-episode psychosis "" ( FEP )  has been conducted , despite the potential benefits of using these treatments during the early stages of illness . Therefore , we aim ed to review all studies examining efficacy , tolerability and the biological mechanisms of action , of  nutrient supplementation  in FEP . METHODS A systematic review of electronic data bases was conducted from inception to July 2017 . All information on feasibility , clinical outcomes and mechanistic findings from  nutrient supplementation  clinical trials was extracted and systematic ally synthesized . RESULTS  Eleven studies with a total of 451 patients with FEP ( from 8 independent r and omized controlled trials ) were eligible for inclusion  . Six studies examined omega-3 fatty acids , with inconsistent effects on  psychiatric symptoms .  However , mechanistic studies found significant improvements in  hippocampal neuronal health and brain glutathione .   Antioxidants "" n-acetyl cysteine ""  ( n = 1 ) and  vitamin C  ( n = 2 ) also improved  oxidative status in FEP  , which was associated with reduced  psychiatric symptoms .  No benefits were found for  vitamin E  ( n = 1 ) . Finally , one study trialling the amino acid  taurine  , showed significant improvements in  positive symptoms and psychosocial functioning .   There is preliminary evidence  that taurine  improves outcomes in FEP , whereas effects of  omega-3 and antioxidant vitamins/amino-acids  are inconsistent ; perhaps mainly benefitting patients with high levels of  oxidative stress  . Future studies should evaluate  multifaceted dietary and supplementation interventions  in FEP ; targeting-specific nutritional deficits and the range of aberrant biological processes implicated in the disorder."
"gQUESTION In  people who have been discharged from hospital after a total hip replacement  , do  rehabilitation exercises  directed by a physiotherapist improve  strength , gait , function and quality of life  ? Are these exercises as effective in an unsupervised home-based setting as they are in a supervised outpatient setting ? DESIGN Systematic review with meta- analysis of r and omised trials . PARTICIPANTS  Adult patients after elective total hip replacement .  INTERVENTION  Physiotherapist-directed rehabilitation exercises  after discharge from hospital following  total hip replacement .  OUTCOME MEASURES  Hip and knee strength , gait parameters , functional measures , and quality of life .  RESULTS  Five studies comprising 234 participants  were included in the review . Sufficient data for meta- analysis were only obtained for  hip and knee strength , gait speed and cadence .  Physiotherapy rehabilitation improved  hip abductor strength  by a mean of 16Nm ( 95 % CI 10 to 22 ) ,  gait speed  by 6 m/min ( 95 % CI 1 to 11 ) and  cadence  by 20 steps/min ( 95 % CI 8 to 32 ) . Favourable but non-significant  improvements in strength  were noted for other muscle groups at the hip and knee .  Function and quality of life  could not be meta-analysed due to insufficient data and heterogeneity of measures , but functional measures tended to favour the physiotherapy rehabilitation group . Most outcomes were similar between outpatient and home-based exercise programs .   Physiotherapy rehabilitation  improves  hip abductor strength , gait speed and cadence  in  people who have been discharged from hospital after total hip replacement .  Physiotherapist-directed  rehabilitation exercises  appear to be similarly effective whether they are performed unsupervised at home or supervised by a physiotherapist in an outpatient setting."
"eZinc plays critical roles during embryogenesis , fetal growth , and milk secretion , which increase the zinc need for pregnancy and lactation . Increased needs can be met by increasing the  dietary zinc  intake , along with making homeostatic adjustments in zinc utilization . Potential homeostatic adjustments include changes in circulating zinc , increased  zinc  absorption , decreased  zinc  losses , and changes in  whole body zinc kinetics .  Although severe  zinc deficiency during pregnancy  has devastating effects , systematic review s and meta- analysis of the effect of maternal  zinc supplementation  on pregnancy outcomes have consistently shown a limited benefit . We hypothesize , therefore , that zinc homeostatic adjustments during pregnancy and lactation improve zinc utilization sufficiently to provide the increased zinc needs in these stages and , therefore , mitigate immediate detrimental effects due to a low zinc intake . The specific questions addressed are the following : How is  zinc utilization  altered during pregnancy and lactation ? Are those  homeostatic adjustments  influenced by  maternal zinc status , dietary zinc , or zinc supplementation  ? These questions are addressed by critically review ing results from published human studies on  zinc homeostasis  during pregnancy and lactation carried out in different population s worldwide."

"sIn order to determine the impact of   garlic  on  total cholesterol ( TC ) , TAG levels , as well as LDL and HDL   , and establish if any variables have an impact on the magnitude of this effect , a meta- analysis was conducted . A systematic literature search of MEDLINE , CINAHL and the Cochrane Data base from the earliest possible date through to November 2007 was conducted to identify  r and omised ,  placebo-controlled   trials of  garlic  that reported effects on  TC , TAG concentrations , LDL or HDL .  The weighted mean difference of the change from baseline ( with 95 % CI ) was calculated as the difference between the means in the  garlic  groups and the control groups using a r and om-effects model . Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effects on type , br and and duration of  garlic   therapy  as well as  baseline TC and TAG levels  , the use of  dietary modification  , and  study quality  on the meta- analysis 's conclusions .  Twenty-nine trials were included in the analysis .  Upon meta- analysis  garlic  was found to significantly reduce  TC  ( - 0.19 ; 95 % CI - 0.33 , - 0.06 mmol/l ) and  TAG  ( - 0.11 ; 95 % CI - 0.19 , - 0.06 mmol/l ) but exhibited no significant effect on  LDL or HDL .  There was a moderate degree of statistical heterogeneity for the  TC and TAG analyses  .  Garlic  reduces  TC  to a modest extent , an effect driven mostly by the modest reductions in  TAG  , without appreciable  LDL lowering or HDL elevation .  Higher baseline  line TC levels  and the use of dietary modification may alter the effect of  garlic  on these parameters . Future studies should be conducted evaluating the impact of  adjunctive garlic therapy with fibrates  or  statins  on TAG concentrations."

"sABSTRACT  Anemia  is a worldwide public health problem that can be related to many causes , including vitamin A deficiency . The aim of this study was to assess and estimate the effect of  vitamin A supplementation ( VAS )  on iron status biomarkers and anemia in humans . Six data bases , including Cochrane , EMBASE , LILACS , Pubmed , Scopus and Web of Science , were search ed for clinical trials and cohort studies that investigated the effect of  vitamin A supplementation  alone on iron status and anemia , without time-restriction . The search yielded  23 eligible studies , 21 clinical trials and 2 cohort studies , with children , teenagers , pregnant or lactating women .  The meta- analysis of the clinical trials showed that VAS reduces the  risk of anemia  by 26 % and  raises hemoglobin levels  , compared to non-treated group , independent of the life stage . VAS did not alter the  prevalence of iron deficiency  among the clinical trials conducted with  children and teenagers  ( RR 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.60 to 1.12 , p = 0.204 ) , whereas a significant increase  in serum ferritin levels  was observed in trials conducted with pregnant and lactating women ( WMD 6.61 μg/L ; 95 % CI 6.00 to 7.21 μg/L ; p < 0.001 ) .  Therefore , vitamin A supplementation  alone may reduce the  risk of anemia  , by  improving hemoglobin and ferritin levels  in individuals with low serum retinol levels."

"sAlthough several studies have evaluated the  inhibitory effect  of   probiotics   on   halitosis   , findings are inconsistent . This systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized clinical trials ( RCT ) was conducted to summarize the evidence on the effect of   probiotics  on  halitosis  .  RCT on any type of  probiotic  treatment  with at least 2-week  duration were identified through electronic data bases ( PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) and  h and search ed between 1946 and January 17 , 2017 .  Primary outcomes were  organoleptic ( OLT ) scores and volatile sulfur compounds ( VSC ) . St and ardized mean difference ( SMD  ) and 95 %  confidence interval  ( CI ) were calculated . Meta- analysis was conducted to synthesize the evidence . Of the  153 articles identified , three met  the inclusion criteria . Meta- analysis revealed  that OLT scores  ( SMD = − 1.93 , 95 % CI − 2.85 to − 1.02 , P < 0.0001 ) were significantly lower in  subjects who  received  probiotics  than in  placebo  groups , but no significant difference was observed at  the VSC concentration  ( SMD = − 0.02 , 95 % CI − 2.12 to 2.07 , P = 0.98 ) . Current evidence is supportive of recommending  probiotics  for the  management of halitosis  . Based on this review , transient ( average of 2 weeks ) dosing with probiotics ( mainly Lactobacillus strains ) has a moderate effect  on halitosis regarding OLT scores  , but we could not confirm the effects of probiotics on the VSC reduction . The available evidence is quantitatively and qualitatively insufficient for further recommendations , especially with regard to administration strategies and pretreatment . Future studies should aim for longer follow-up and st and ardized administration methods to prove or refute the effect of probiotics on halitosis."

"nTo investigate if there is evidence for a ‘ legacy effect ’ for  blood pressure  (  BP  ) lowering treatment , that is , worse health outcomes from not initiating drug treatment at a  systolic BP threshold of 140 mmHg in middle-age adults .  We systematic ally review ed studies comparing the effects of  delayed  BP treatment  ( placebo/untreated  during the trial  or no previous  treatment at trial  entry  )  vs. early treatment ( actively treated during  the trial  or previous  BP treatment  at trial entry  )   on mortality in the short term ( 5-year in-trial period ) and long term ( ≥10 years in total period ) . The data were pooled using Peto ORs . A subgroup analysis by 10-year Framingham risk score was performed .  Three studies ( ALLHAT , Oslo and PREVEND-IT ) involving 4746 participants were included .  The results were heavily influenced by the ALLHAT trial . We found no significant  difference in all-cause mortality   between ‘ delayed BP ’ and ‘ early treatment ’  in the short-term OR 0.95 ( 95 % CI 0.68–1.32 ) or long-term OR 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.78–1.04 ) , with similar results  for mortality  from cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The effects of  delayed BP  lowering  treatment on long-term all-cause and CVD mortality  did not vary with baseline risk of CVD . The review showed no clinical ly adverse  ‘  legacy  effect ’ on mortality or major CVD event  from not treating  middle-aged adults  at a systolic BP threshold of 140 mmHg or over . The results were consistent for all CVD risk subgroups . Although these studies are non-r and omised post-hoc analyses , they may allay concerns that early treatment  of elevated systolic BP  is necessary to prevent CVD events in primary prevention population."

"sHIGHLIGHTSPreterm  birth  is associated with an elevated  risk for neurodevelopmental deficits .   Auditory event‐related potentials  can be used to assess  early cognitive functioning .  This paper represents the first systematic review investigating the predictive power of AERPs on   cognition  in preterms .  According to our findings ,  auditory event‐related potentials  can help to  predict neurodevelopmental outcome  in preterms . More evidence ‐based studies are needed before clinical ly applying this method . ABSTRACT Prematurity is a known risk factor for later  cognitive deficits  . At present there are neither behavioral nor neurological tests available to detect those  preterm infants  who would benefit most from early interventions . Neurophysiologic methods , and more specifically ,  auditory event‐related potentials ( AERPs )  are convenient tools to investigate early cognitive functioning . However , the capability of AERPs as a prognostic factor for  mental development  in preterm infants remains unclear . The present systematic search of the  literature yielded 1016 articles , out of which 13were included .  Both prospect i ve and cross‐sectional studies reported a relationship  between AERPs and cognitive outcome .  Our results show  that larger amplitudes and shorter latencies of late AERPs are related to better cognitive outcomes .  Additional studies are needed to corroborate our findings regarding this potential use of AERPs in the individual evaluation of preterm born infants."
" There is limited evidence that  verbally based and ACC interventions  improve  spoken and non-verbal communication  in minimally verbal  children with ASD .  A substantial number of studies have investigated communication interventions for minimally verbal  children with ASD  , yet only two studies met inclusion criteria for this review , and we considered the overall quality of the evidence to be very low . In the study that used an  AAC intervention  , there were significant gains in  frequency of PECS use and verbal and non-verbal initiations  , but not in  expressive vocabulary or social communication  immediately postintervention . In the study that investigated a verbally based intervention , there were no significant gains in  expressive language  postintervention , but children with  lower expressive language  at the beginning of the study improved more than those with better expressive language at baseline . Neither study investigated  adverse events , other communication skills , quality of life or behavioural outcomes .  Future RCTs that compare two interventions and include a  control group  will allow us to better underst and treatment effects in the context of spontaneous maturation and will allow further comparison of different interventions as well as the investigation of moderating factors."
"tPhysical  activity  is recommended for  people with stable heart failure ( HF )  , because it is known to improve  quality of life  and  health outcomes .  However , adherence to this recommendation has been poor in many studies . A systematic review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of strategies used to promote  exercise adherence  in those  with HF .  The following data bases were search ed for relevant literature published between January 1980 and December 2010 : British Nursing Index ; CINAHL ; Cochrane Library ; Embase ; Medline and PsycINFO . Papers with a control group focused on  adults with HF  that measured  exercise  or  physical activity  adherence were included .  Nine r and omised controlled trials were  identified ,  involving a total of 3,231 patients ( range 16–2,331 ) .  Six of these studies were informed by specific psychological theories .  Positive outcomes  occurred in the short-term from interventions using approaches such as   exercise prescriptions , goal setting , feedback  and  problem-solving .   However , longer-term  maintenance of  exercise   was less  successful  . There was some support for interventions underpinned by theoretical frameworks , but more research is required to make clearer recommendations . Addressing  self-efficacy  in relation to exercise may be a particularly useful area to consider in this respect."
">BACKGROUND The utility of  iron fortification  of food to improve iron  deficiency , anemia  , and biological outcomes is not proven unequivocally . OBJECTIVES The objectives were to evaluate 1 ) the effect of  iron fortification  on  hemoglobin and serum ferritin  and the  prevalence  of  iron deficiency  and  anemia  , 2 ) the possible predictors of a positive hemoglobin response , 3 ) the effect of  iron  fortification on  zinc  and  iron  status , and 4 ) the effect of  iron-fortified  foods on  mental and motor development , anthropometric measures  , and  infections .  DESIGN  R and omized and pseudor and omized controlled trials  that included  food fortification or biofortification with iron  were included . RESULTS Data from  60 trials  showed that  iron fortification  of foods result ed in a significant increase in  hemoglobin  ( 0.42 g/dL ; 95 % CI : 0.28 , 0.56 ; P < 0.001 )  and serum ferritin  ( 1.36 μg/L ; 95 % CI : 1.23 , 1.52 ; P < 0.001 ) , a  reduced risk of anemia  ( RR : 0.59 ; 95 % CI : 0.48 , 0.71 ; P < 0.001 )  and iron deficiency  ( RR : 0.48 ; 95 % CI : 0.38 , 0.62 ; P < 0.001 ) , improvement  in other indicators of iron nutriture  , and no  effect on serum zinc concentrations , infections , physical growth , and mental and motor development .  Significant heterogeneity was observed for most of the evaluated outcomes . Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression for hemoglobin suggested a higher response with lower trial quality ( suboptimal allocation concealment and blinding ) , use of condiments , and sodium iron edetate and a lower response when adults were included .  Consumption  of iron-fortified foods  results in an  improvement in hemoglobin , serum ferritin , and iron nutriture  and a  reduced  risk of  remaining anemic and iron deficient ."
"2Evidence suggests engaging in  regular physical activity ( PA )  can have beneficial outcomes for  adults with type 2 diabetes ( TD2 )  , including  weight loss , reduction of medication usage and improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)/fasting glucose .  While a number of  clinical  -based  PA  interventions exist , community-based approaches are limited . The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review with meta- analysis to assess the effectiveness of  community-based PA interventions  for the treatment of  TD2 in adult population s.  A search of peer- review ed publications from  2002 to  June 2012 was conducted across several electronic data bases to identify interventions evaluated in community setting s.  Twenty-two studies were identified  , and 11 studies reporting  HbA1c  as an outcome measure were pooled in the meta- analysis . Risk of bias assessment was also conducted . The findings  demonstrate  community-based PA interventions  can be effective in producing  increases in PA  .  Meta- analysis revealed a  lowering of HbA1c levels  by -0.32 % [ 95 % CI -0.65 , 0.01 ] , which approached statistical significance ( p < 0.06 ) . Our findings can guide  future PA community-based  interventions   in adult population s diagnosed with TD2."

" We found that short-term use of methylpheni date might improve  symptoms of hyperactivity and possibly inattention  in  children with ASD who are tolerant of the medication  , although the low quality of evidence means that we can not be certain of the true magnitude of any effect . There was no evidence that methylpheni date has a negative impact on the core symptoms of ASD , or that it improves  social interaction , stereotypical behaviours , or overall ASD .  The evidence for adverse events is of very low quality because trials were short and excluded children intolerant of methylpheni date in the test-dose phase . Future RCTs should consider extending the duration of treatment and follow-up . The minimum clinical ly important difference also needs to be confirmed in children with ASD using outcome scales vali date d for this population."
"sWe undertook a systematic review and meta- analysis of published papers assessing   dietary protein  and bone health .  We found little benefit of increasing protein intake for   bone health  in healthy adults  but no indication of any detrimental effect , at least within the protein intakes of the population s studied . This systematic review and meta- analysis analysed the relationship between  dietary protein  and bone health across the life-course . The PubMed data base was search ed for  all relevant human studies from the 1st January 1976 to 22nd January 2016 , including all bone outcomes except calcium metabolism .  The search es identified  127 papers for inclusion , including 74 correlational studies , 23 fracture or osteoporosis risk studies and 30 supplementation trials .  Protein intake accounted for 0–4 % of areal BMC and areal BMD variance in  adults  and 0–14 % of areal BMC variance in  children and adolescents .  However , when confounder adjusted ( 5 studies )  adult lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD  associations were not statistically significant . There was no association  between protein intake and relative risk ( RR ) of osteoporotic fractures  for total ( RR(r and om ) = 0.94 ; 0.72 to 1.23 , I2 = 32 % ) , animal ( RR ( r and om ) = 0.98 ; 0.76 to 1.27 , I2 = 46 % ) or vegetable protein ( RR ( fixed ) = 0.97 ( 0.89 to 1.09 , I2 = 15 % ) . In  total protein supplementation  studies , pooled effect sizes were not statistically significant for LSBMD ( total n = 255 , MD(fixed ) = 0.04 g/cm2 ( 0.00 to 0.08 , P = 0.07 ) , I2 = 0 % ) or FNBMD ( total n = 435 , MD(r and om ) = 0.01 g/cm2 ( −0.03 to 0.05 , P = 0.59 ) , I2 = 68 % ) . There appears to be little benefit of increasing protein  intake  for  bone  health in  healthy  adults but there is also clearly no indication of any detrimental effect , at least within the protein intakes of the population s studied ( around 0.8–1.3 g/Kg/day ) . More studies are urgently required on the association  between protein intake and bone health  in  children and  adolescents."

"nThe relevance of  dairy produce  for the diminishment of  osteoporotic risk  is still a matter of scientific debate due to the outcome of a few single observational studies . This review will address the most robust point estimate on the role of  dairy products  , as reported in systematic review s and meta-analyses on r and omised controlled trials in the case of bone mineralisation or prospect i ve studies in the case of fracture risk .  Plain dairy products or those fortified with Ca and /or vitamin D  improve  total body bone mineral content ( BMC )  by 45 - 50 g over 1 year when the daily baseline Ca intake is lower than 750 mg  in Caucasians and Chinese girls .  In  Caucasian and Chinese women  , Ca from  ( fortified ) dairy products   increases bone mineral density ( BMD )  by 0·7 - 1·8 % over 2 years dependent on the site of measurement . Despite the results on BMC , there are currently no studies that have investigated the potential of dairy products to reduce  fracture risk   in children . In adult Caucasian women  , daily intake of 200 - 250 ml of milk is associated with a  reduction in fracture risk  of 5 % or higher . In conclusion , the role of dairy products  for BMC or BMD  has been sufficiently established in  Chinese and Caucasian girls and women .  In  Caucasian women  , drinking milk also  reduces fracture risk  . More research on the role of  dairy products  within the context of bone health-promoting diets is needed in specific  ethnicities  , other than Chinese and Caucasians , and in men."

"ePurpose In the foot and ankle literature , a wide range of  patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs )  is used , however , consensus as to which PROMs are preferred is lacking . Selection of a  PROM  is among other reasons , often based on measurement properties without considering the method ological quality of the studies that evaluate these measurement properties . The aim of current study was first to identify the most frequently used  foot  and ankle-specific  PROMs  in recent  orthopaedic foot and ankle  literature , and second to conduct a systematic review to synthesize and critically appraise the measurement properties of these PROMS . Methods  Six PubMed indexed journals focussing on foot and ankle research were screened  to identify  most commonly used  foot and ankle-specific PROMs  over a 2 year period ( 2015–2016 ) .  Subsequently , a systematic literature search was performed in PubMed , EMBASE , SPORTD iscus and Scopus to identify relevant studies on their measurement properties . Method ological quality assessment was performed using the COnsensus-based St and ards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments ( COSMIN ) checklist , criteria for good measurement properties were applied , and a level of evidence was determined for the measurement properties of each domain of the question naires . Results The three most frequently reported PROMs were the  Foot Function Index ( FFI ) , the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score ( FAOS ) and the Foot and Ankle Activity Measure ( FAAM )  . Among  2046 unique citations , 50 studies were included evaluating  these PROMs  .  Evidence to support the  measurement properties of the  FFI was mainly lacking due to poor method ological quality . More evidence was available for the measurement properties of the FAOS and the FAAM , but overall evidence supporting all measurement properties is not yet sufficient . Conclusion The best available evidence retrieved in this review showed that the FAOS and the FAAM are promising outcome measures for evaluation of  patients with foot and ankle conditions  , but their shortcomings should be taken into account when interpreting results in clinical setting or trials .

 The failure of  vitamin C supplementation  to reduce the  incidence of colds  in the  normal population  indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use . But evidence suggests that it could be justified in people exposed to brief periods of severe  physical exercise or  cold environments.
"dBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE  Acute stress  in  surgery  is ubiquitous and has an immediate impact on surgical performance and patient safety . Surgeons react with several coping strategies ; however , they recognise the necessity of formal stress management training . Thus ,  stress assessment  is a direct need .  Surgical simulation  is a vali date d st and ardised training milieu design ed to replicate real-life situations . It replicates stress , prevents biases , and provides objective metrics . The complexity of stress mechanisms makes stress measurement difficult to quantify and interpret . This systematic review aims to identify studies that have used  acute stress estimation measurements  in  surgeons or surgical trainees  during  real operations or surgical simulation  , and to collectively present the rationale of these tools , with special emphasis in salivary markers . METHODS A search strategy was implemented to retrieve relevant  articles from MEDLINE and SCOPUS data bases .  The  738 articles retrieved  were review ed for further evaluation according to the predetermined inclusion /exclusion criteria . RESULTS  Thirty-three studies were included  in this systematic review . The methods for  acute stress assessment  varied greatly among studies with the non-invasive techniques being the most commonly used . Subjective and objective tests for surgeons '  acute stress assessment  are being presented .  There is a broad spectrum of  acute mental stress assessment  tools in the surgical field and simulation and salivary biomarkers have recently gained popularity . There is a need to maintain a consistent methodology in future research , towards a deeper underst and ing of acute stress in the surgical field."
"tOBJECTIVES The objective of the study was to assess the usability of  minimal important difference ( MID ) and minimal clinical ly important difference ( MCID )  for measuring meaningful changes in disease-specific and generic  health-related quality -of-life ( HRQoL ) outcomes  in  patient-centered care .  STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We adopted a two-step literature review process . First , we used PubMed and Google scholar to identify a broad range of search terms . Next , we search ed OVID Medline , JSTOR , and PubMed for terms ""  MID  , "" and ""  MCID  . "" We  excluded non-English language studies , articles older than 1995 , those not related to generic- and disease-specific HRQoL measures , and protocol s of future studies .  Studies were grouped according to generic- and disease-specific measures . We assessed  MID or MCID  calculation methods ,  effect sizes  ,  estimated values  , and  significance .  RESULTS  Eighty articles satisfied the inclusion criteria .  Our synthesis provides a comprehensive assessment of  MID or MCID  for 10 generic-specific and 80 disease-specific instruments . We observed a lack of consistency in the application of methods for  computing MID or MCID  for generic and disease-specific HRQoL measures . Only 43 ( 54 % ) studies used both anchor and distribution methods to elicit  MID or MCID .  Thirty-four articles estimated  MID values  only , whereas 47 articles estimated  MCID  .  The anchor-based method yields conservative estimates of  MID or MCID  , compared to the distribution-based method . The distribution method does not take into account patient perspectives and should be accompanied by anchor method while computing MID . The MID should be interpreted with caution , and available estimates for a particular instrument must be used . This will help in integrating the MID estimates into the overall research or clinical plan for a specific context."
"eThis study examined the effect of  lifestyle interventions  on   cardiovascular disease risk factors  among workers .  The study comprised a systematic review and meta- analysis of controlled trials . Relevant controlled trials were search ed , with selection s based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines . Risk of bias was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) . Of  1174 identified publications  ,  one low-  quality study was excluded . Finally ,  10  were analyzed  .  The effect sizes were analyzed for heterogeneity , and r and om effect models ( Hedge 's g ) were used . A subgroup analysis was performed on the follow-up point of intervention ( ≤ 12 months vs. > 12 months ) .  Publication bias  was also analyzed . Interventions were  effective for systolic  ( g = 0.66 , 95 % CI :  0.27  - 1.60  ) and diastolic blood pressure  ( g = 0.63 , 95 % CI :  0.21  -  1.06 ) , and BMI  ( g = 0.71 , 95 % CI : 0.15 - 1.11 ) . Interventions  were ineffective for weight  ( g = 0.18 , 95 % CI : -0.04 , 0.40  ) and LDL-cholesterol  ( g = 0.46 , 95 % CI : -0.02 , 0.93 ) . There was  high  heterogeneity between studies ( I2 = 78.45 to I2 = 94.61 ) . There was no statistically  significant publication bias  ,  except for systolic blood pressure  . Interventions to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease risk might be effective in improving physical outcomes , but additional high- quality trials are needed in the future."
"tFinancial  incentives  to improve health have received increasing attention , but are subject to ethical concerns .  Monetary Contingency Contracts ( MCCs )  , which require individuals to deposit money that is refunded contingent on reaching a goal , are a potential alternative strategy . This review evaluates systematic ally the evidence for weight loss – related MCCs . R and omised controlled trials testing the effect of weight loss – related MCCs were identified in online data bases . R and om-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate overall effect sizes for weight loss and participant retention . The association between MCC characteristics and  weight loss/participant retention effects  was calculated using meta-regression . There was a significant small-to-medium  effect of  MCCs  on weight loss during treatment  when one outlier study was removed . Group refunds , deposit not paid as lump sum , participants setting their own deposit size and additional behaviour change techniques were associated with  greater weight loss  during treatment . Post-treatment , there was  no significant effect of  MCCs  on weight loss .  There was a significant  small-to-medium effect of  MCCs  on participant retention  during treatment . Research er-set deposits paid as one lump sum , refunds delivered on an all-or-nothing basis and refunds contingent on attendance at classes were associated with greater  retention  during treatment . Post-treatment , there was  no significant effect of  MCCs  on participant retention .  The results support the use of  MCCs  to promote  weight loss and participant retention  up to the point that the incentive is removed and identifies the conditions under which  MCCs  work best."
 There is a lack of evidence regarding quality studies justifying the use of alternative products for weight loss.

" This review provides evidence for the effectiveness of a stepped-care approach in the management of  patients with  IAH   , initially with  structured diabetes  education in  flexible insulin therapy  , which may incorporate  psychotherapeutic  and behavioral therapies , progressing to diabetes technology , incorporating sensors and insulin pumps , in those with persisting need."
 These data show  that  weight loss is associated with an  increase in both bound and unbound testosterone levels .  The normalization of sex hormones induced by body weight loss is a possible mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of surgery in morbid obesity.
" Quitting smoking is associated with a substantial reduction in  risk of all-cause mortality  among  patients with CHD .  The pooled  crude RR  was 0.64 ( 95 % CI 0.58 to 0.71 ) . This 36 % risk reduction appears substantial compared with other secondary preventive therapies such as cholesterol lowering which have received greater attention in recent years . The risk reduction associated with quitting smoking seems consistent regardless of differences between the studies in terms of index cardiac events , age , sex , country , and time period . However , relatively few studies have included  large  numbers  of older people , women , or people of non-European descent  , and  most were  carried out in  Western countries ."
"dAbstract Enhanced Recovery or  Fast Track Recovery after Surgery protocol s  ( ERAS ) have significantly changed perioperative care following  colorectal surgery  and are promoted as reducing the stress response to surgery . The present systematic review aim ed to examine the impact on the magnitude of the  systemic inflammatory response ( SIR )  for each ERAS component following  colorectal surgery  using objective markers such as C-reactive protein ( CRP ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).A literature search was performed of the US National Library of Medicine ( MEDLINE ) , EMBASE , PubMed , and the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s using appropriate keywords and subject headings to February 2015.Included studies had to assess the impact of the selected ERAS component on the  SIR  using either CRP or IL-6.Nineteen  studies , including 1898 patients , were included . Fourteen studies ( 1246 patients )  examined the impact of  laparoscopic surgery  on the postoperative  markers of SIR .  Ten of these studies ( 1040 patients ) reported that  laparoscopic surgery  reduced  postoperative CRP .  One study ( 53 patients ) reported reduced  postoperative CRP  using  opioid-minimising analgesia  . One study ( 142 patients ) reported no change in  postoperative CRP  following preoperative carbohydrate loading . Two studies ( 108 patients ) reported conflicting results with respect to the impact of   goal -directed fluid therapy   on  postoperative IL-6 .  No studies examined the effect of other ERAS components , including   mechanical bowel preparation , antibiotic prophylaxis , thromboprophylaxis  , and  avoidance of nasogastric tubes and peritoneal drains   on  markers of the postoperative SIR  following colorectal surgery . The present systematic review shows that , with the exception of  laparoscopic surgery  , objective evidence of the effect of individual components of  ERAS protocol s  in reducing the  stress response  following colorectal surgery is limited."
" Despite a compelling theoretical base , research ers have only minimally studied the value of interventions targeting patients ' social networks on diabetes care . Although the body of evidence to date is limited , and based on individual behaviour change theories , the results are promising . This review challenges the scientific community to design and test theory-based interventions that go beyond self-management approaches to focus on the largely untapped potential of social networks to improve diabetes care .

"sThe most widely used method for estimating dietary zinc requirements is the factorial approach , in which it is assumed , in adults , that the physiological zinc requirement is the lowest intake that replaces endogenous zinc losses . Presented here are the results of two review s : a narrative review of zinc losses from the  human body  and a systematic review of factors affecting zinc bioavailability in  adult and elderly population s.  The narrative review presents data on losses from integumental and excretory routes , obtained from  29 papers published  up to April 2013 . The systematic review includes a total of  87 publications describing dietary factors that impact  zinc bioavailability   , 30 of which examined  phytate .  A meta- analysis revealed an overall lowering of  fractional zinc absorption  by 0.14 ( 45 % of control values ) when the phytate  :  zinc molar ratio of the test meal or diet was greater than 15 . These review s provide a comprehensive re source for use in the setting of human dietary zinc requirements and emphasize the need for more high- quality data to improve estimates of zinc losses and gains."
">Previous studies have supposed that  probiotic supplementation  led to a positive effect on  different health outcomes .  Furthermore , several studies indicated that  probiotics supplementation  improved  antioxidant status  , while some studies did not indicate these effects . Hence , current systematic review and meta- analysis study was conducted to determine the effect of  probiotic supplementation  on some  oxidative stress biomarkers   among adult subjects .  We search ed four electronic data bases PubMed , SCOPUS , ISI Web of Science , and the Cochrane Library till November 2017 . Clinical trials that compared the effects of  probiotic supplementation  with the  control group  were included . A r and om-effect model was used to pool weighted mean difference ( WMD ) . Finding of  11 included studies ( n = 577 )  indicated  that probiotic supplementation   increased total antioxidant capacity ( TAC )  ( WMD 77.30 mmol/L ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.60 , 152.01 ; I2 = 88.3 % )  and reduced malondialdehyde ( MDA )  ( WMD − 0.31 μmol/L ; 95 % CI − 0.54 , − 0.08 ; I2 = 71.5 % ) significantly compared to the control group . However , its  effects on glutathione ( GSH )  was not significant ( WMD = 19.32 μmol/L ; 95 % CI − 18.70 , 57.33 ; I2 = 64.9 % ) . The current meta- analysis revealed  that probiotic supplementation  may result in  increasing TAC and lowering MDA  , which  improve antioxidant  status . However , due to high heterogeneity , findings should be interpreted with caution . Further investigations are required to eluci date the effect of  supplementation with probiotics   on biomarkers of antioxidants ."
"sPharmacological cognitive enhancement refers to improvement in cognitive functions after  drug use in healthy individuals .  This popular topic attracts attention both from the general public and the scientific community . The objective was to explore innovative mechanisms of  psychostimulant 's  action , whose potential effectiveness was assessed in r and omized  placebo-controlled  trials ( RCTs ) . A systematic review was carried out , using the words "" attention "" , "" memory "" , "" learning "" , "" executive functions "" , and "" vigilance/wakefulness "" combined to "" cognitive enhancer "" or "" smart  drug ""  .  Methylpheni date , amphetamines , modafinil , nicotine , acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and antidepressants  were extensively studied in previous meta-analyses and were not included in the present work . Drugs were classified according to their primary mode of action , namely  catecholaminergic drugs ( tolcapone , pramipexole , guanfacine )  ,  cholinergic drugs ( anticholinergics )  ,  glutamatergic drugs ( ampakines )  ,  histaminergic drugs  , and  non-specified ( glucocorticoids )  . Overall ,  50 RCTs were included  in the present review . In conclusion , a number of new active drugs were found to improve some  cognitive functions , in particular verbal episodic memory .  However the number of RCTs was limited , and most of the studies found negative results . Future studies should assess both  effectiveness  and  tolerance  of repeated doses administration , and individual variability in dose response ( including baseline characteristics and potential genetic polymorphisms ) . One explanation for the limited number of recent RCTs with new  psychostimulants  seems to be the ethical debate surrounding pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement in healthy subjects."
"y N-acetylcysteine ,  a  sulphur-containing amino acid  for the treatment of  paracetamol overdose  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , is a widely available off-the-shelf oral antioxidant supplement in many countries . With the potential to modulate several neurological pathways , including glutamate dysregulation , oxidative stress , and inflammation that can be beneficial to the brain functions ,  N-acetylcysteine  is being explored as an adjunctive therapy for many psychiatric conditions . This narrative review synthesis es and presents the current evidence from systematic review s , meta-analyses , and latest clinical trials on  N-acetylcysteine  for  addiction and substance abuse  ,  schizophrenia , obsessive-compulsive and related disorders  ,  and mood disorders .  Good evidence exists to support the use of  N-acetylcysteine  as an adjunct treatment to reduce the  total and negative symptoms of schizophrenia .   N-acetylcysteine  also appears to be effective in reducing  craving  in substance use disorders , especially for the treatment of cocaine and cannabis use among young people , in addition to preventing  relapse  in already abstinent individuals . Effects of  N-acetylcysteine  on  obsessive-compulsive and related disorders  , as well as on  mood disorders  , remain unclear with mixed review s , even though promising evidence does exist . Larger and better- design ed studies are required to further investigate the clinical effectiveness of  N-acetylcysteine  in these areas .  Oral N-acetylcysteine  is  safe and well tolerated  without any considerable  adverse effects .  Current evidence supports its use as an adjunctive therapy clinical ly for psychiatric conditions , administered concomitantly with existing medications , with a recommended dosage between 2000 and 2400 mg/day."
"  Antiplatelet agents  have a beneficial effect in reducing  all cause mortality and fatal cardiovascular events  in  patients with IC .  Treatment with  antiplatelet agents  in this patient group however is associated with an increase in adverse  effects  , including GI symptoms , and healthcare professionals and patients need to be aware of the potential harm as well as the benefit of therapy ; more data are required on the effect of antiplatelets on  major bleeding .  Evidence on the effectiveness of  aspirin  versus either  placebo  or an  alternative antiplatelet agent  is lacking . Evidence for  thienopyridine antiplatelet agents  was particularly compelling and there is an urgent need for multicentre trials to compare the effects of  aspirin  against thienopyridines."
" Despite the growth of the  elderly population  worldwide , high- quality research on the burden of chronic musculoskeletal disorders in  the elderly  is still scarce .

"tSeveral review s and meta-analyses have examined the  effects  of  iodine  on  mental development .  None focused on  young children  , so they were incomplete in summarizing the effects on this important age group . The current systematic review therefore examined the relationship between iodine and mental  development of children 5 years old and under .  A systematic review of articles using Medline ( 1980–November 2011 ) was carried out . We organized studies according to four design s : ( 1 ) r and omized controlled trial with  iodine supplementation  of  mothers ;  ( 2 )  non-r  and  omized trial  with  iodine supplementation of mothers  and  /or infants ;  ( 3 )  prospect i ve cohort study stratified by pregnant women ’s iodine status ;  ( 4 )  prospect i ve cohort study stratified by newborn iodine status .   Average effect sizes  for these four design s were 0.68 ( 2 RCT studies ) , 0.46 ( 8 non- RCT studies ) , 0.52 ( 9 cohort stratified by mothers ’ iodine status ) , and 0.54 ( 4 cohort stratified by infants ’ iodine status ) . This translates into 6.9 to 10.2 IQ points lower in  iodine deficient children  compared with  iodine  replete  children  . Thus , regardless of study design , iodine deficiency had a substantial impact on mental development . Method ological concerns included weak study design s , the omission of important confounders , small sample sizes , the lack of cluster analyses , and the lack of separate analyses of  verbal and non-verbal subtests .  Quantifying more precisely the contribution of iodine deficiency to  delayed  mental development  in young children  requires more well- design ed r and omized controlled trials , including ones on the role of iodized salt."

"sBACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes is impacting millions of people globally ; however , many future cases can be prevented through lifestyle changes and interventions . Primary care is an important setting for diabetes prevention , for  at-risk population s  , because it is a patient 's primary point of contact with the health care system and professionals can provide lifestyle counselling and support , as well as monitoring health outcomes . These are all essential elements for diabetes prevention for  at-risk adults .  AIM To underst and the factors related to the delivery and uptake of type 2 diabetes prevention interventions within  primary care in higher income countries .  METHODS For this narrative systematic review , we combined qualitative and quantitative studies of diabetes prevention within a  primary care setting  for  patients at-risk of developing the condition .  We used an iterative approach for evidence collection , which included using several data bases ( MEDLINE , Embase , Pysch info , BNI , SSCI , CINAHL , ASSIA ) , where we combined diabetes terms with primary care terms . Narrative and thematic synthesis were utilised to identify the prominent themes emerging from the data . RESULTS  A data base of 6646 records was screened by  the  research  team ,  and 18 papers were included .  Three major themes were identified in this review . The first theme of context and setting of diabetes progression includes the risk and progression of diabetes , primary care as a setting , and where the responsibility for change is thought to lie . This review also found mixed views on the value of preventative services within primary care . The second theme focused on the various patient factors associated with diabetes prevention such as a patient 's  motivation  to modify their  current lifestyle  ,  perceptions and knowledge ( or lack thereof ) of the impacts of diabetes  , lack  of follow-up  in  healthcare setting  s , and  trust  in  healthcare  professionals . The third theme was centred on professional  factors  impacting on diabetes prevention which included  workload , time constraints , re sources , self-efficacy and knowledge  as well as  professionals ' perception of patient motivations  towards change .  This review explored the factors influencing diabetes prevention in  primary care  , and identified the context of prevention , as well as patient and professional factors related to preventative services being offered in primary care . This systematic review complements previous review s of real-world setting s by exploring the significant factors in prevention , and the findings are relevant to academics , policymakers , patients and practitioners interested in underst and ing the factors associated with the delivery and uptake of diabetes prevention interventions."
"tPurpose The purpose of this review is to systematic ally explore and summarise the validity and reliability of  telerehabilitation (TR)-based physiotherapy assessment  for  musculoskeletal disorders .  Method A comprehensive systematic literature review was conducted using a number of electronic data bases : PubMed , EMBASE , PsycINFO , Cochrane Library and CINAHL , published between January 2000 and May 2015 . The studies examined the validity , inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of   TR-based physiotherapy assessment  for musculoskeletal conditions  were included . Two independent review ers used the   Quality Appraisal Tool for  studies of  diagnostic Reliability  (  QAREL   ) and the  Quality  Assessment  of Diagnostic  Accuracy Studies   (  QUADAS  ) tool to assess the method ological quality of reliability and validity studies respectively . Results  A total of 898 hits were achieved , of which 11 articles based on inclusion criteria were review ed .  Nine studies explored the concurrent validity , inter- and intra-rater reliabilities , while two studies examined only the concurrent validity . Review ed studies were moderate to good in method ological quality . The physiotherapy assessment s such as  pain , swelling , range of motion , muscle strength , balance , gait and functional assessment  demonstrated good  concurrent validity  . However , the reported  concurrent validity  of  lumbar spine posture , special orthopaedic tests , neurodynamic tests and scar assessment  s ranged from low to moderate .  Conclusion TR-based physiotherapy assessment  was technically feasible with overall good concurrent validity and excellent reliability , except for lumbar spine posture ,  orthopaedic  special tests ,  neurodynamic testa  and scar assessment."
"sUse of alcohol  , cannabis  and  opioids  is highly prevalent and is associated with global disease burden and high economic costs . The exact pathophysiology of abuse or addiction associated with these sedative substances is not completely understood , but previous research implicates the important role of the striatal dopamine system in the addiction process . Multiple studies investigated changes in the striatal dopamine systems of users of sedative substances , but currently these results are very heterogeneous . Therefore , we conducted a meta- analysis of in  vivo neuroimaging  studies investigating  dopaminergic alterations  in the striatum of  users of  alcohol , opioids or cannabis .   Analyses for each substance were conducted separately for the availability of D2/D3 dopamine receptors , dopamine transporters and dopamine synthesis capacity . In total ,  723 substance users and 752 healthy controls were included .  The results indicated a significant  lower striatal D2/D3 receptor availability  in alcohol users compared to controls ( g = 0.46 ) but no difference in  dopamine transporter availability or dopamine synthesis capacity .  Our analysis indicated that  changes of dopamine receptors and transporters  are moderated by the  duration of abstinence .  Comparing opioid users with controls revealed a significant lower  D2/D3 receptor availability  ( g = 1.17 ) and a significantly  lower transporter availability  ( g = 1.55 ) in opioid users . For cannabis users , there was no significant difference in  receptor availability  compared to controls and too few studies provided information on  dopamine transporter availability  or  synthesis capacity .  Our analysis provides strong evidence for a central role of the striatal dopamine system in use of alcohol or opioids . Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of the dopamine system in  cannabis  users."

"sBACKGROUND Falls are the leading cause of traumatic brain injury and fractures and the No. 1 cause of emergency department visits by  older adults .  Although declines in muscle strength and sensory function contribute to increased falls in older  adults  , skeletal muscle fatigue is often overlooked as an additional contributor to fall risk . In an effort to increase awareness of the detrimental effects of skeletal muscle fatigue on postural control , we sought to systematic ally review research studies examining this issue . PURPOSE The specific purpose of this review was to provide a detailed assessment of how  anticipatory and reactive postural control tasks  are influenced by   acute muscle fatigue  in healthy older individuals .  METHODS An extensive search was performed using the CINAHL , Scopus  ,  PubMed  ,  SPORTD iscus  , and AgeLine data bases  for the  period from inception of each data base to June 2013 .  This systematic review used st and ardized search criteria and quality assessment s via the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine Methodology to Develop Systematic Review s of Treatment Interventions ( 2008 version , revision 1.2 , AACPDM , Milwaukee , Wisconsin ) . RESULTS  A total of 334 citations were found . Six studies were selected for inclusion , whereas 328 studies were excluded from the analytical review .  The majority of articles ( 5 of 6 ) utilized  reactive postural control paradigms .  All studies incorporated extrinsic measures of  muscle  fatigue , such as declines  in maximal voluntary contraction or available active range of motion .  The most common biomechanical postural control task outcomes were  spatial measures , temporal measures , and end-points of lower extremity joint kinetics .   On the basis of systematic review of relevant literature , it appears that muscle fatigue induces clear deteriorations in reactive postural control . A paucity of high- quality studies examining anticipatory postural control supports the need for further research in this area . These results should serve to heighten awareness regarding the potential negative effects of acute muscle fatigue on postural control and support the examination of muscle endurance training as a fall risk intervention in future studies."

" Currently available clinical data do not support the routine , long-term use of  aspirin  dosages greater than 75 to 81 mg/d in the setting of cardiovascular disease prevention . Higher dosages , which may be commonly prescribed , do not better prevent events but are associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal bleeding."
"sObservational studies demonstrating reduced  rates of infections , necrotizing enterocolitis  ( NEC )  , and mortality  in  preterm infants fed their own  mother ’s milk  , as opposed to formula  , have prompted endeavors to achieve similar effects with the right choice of food and food additives . In a systematic review of meta-analyses and r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , we considered nutritional interventions aim ed at reducing the  rates of infections , NEC  , or  mortality  in  very preterm infants .  The overall effects of particular interventions were presented as risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals . In RCTs ,  pasteurized human donor milk  , as opposed to  formula  , reduced  NEC  but not  infections or mortality .  No differences emerged between  infants receiving  human  or  bovine milk-based fortifiers  .  Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that  bovine lactoferrin  reduced  rates of fungal sepsis  without impact on  other infections , NEC , or mortality .  Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of  prebiotic oligosaccharides  found  reduced infection but not mortality .   Enteral L-glutamine  ( six RCTs ) lowered  infection rates  , and  enteral L-arginine  ( three RCTs ) reduced  NEC .  A meta- analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain ( but not single-strain ) probiotics to be highly effective in reducing  NEC and mortality .  Thus , selected food components may help to improve outcomes in preterm infants."

"gThis study aims to determine  osteoporosis  ( OP  )  investigation and treatment within post-fracture  initiatives  conducted  in fracture clinics and other orthopedic environments .  A systematic review was conducted . Eligibility criteria were  : hip fracture patients plus all other fracture patients presenting with a fragility fracture , orthopedic setting where orthopedic physicians/staff were involved ,  intervention to improve OP management  , primary data on ≥20 patients from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs )  and other study design s. We calculated outcome data within 6 months of screening from an intention-to-treat principle to derive an equated proportion ( EP ) across interventions . Outcomes were  : ( 1 ) proportion of patients investigated with bone densitometry , ( 2 ) proportion of patients initiating OP medication , and ( 3 ) proportion of patients taking OP medication  .  We identified 2,259 citations , of which 57 articles that included 64 intervention groups were eligible .   The median EP  for  patients  investigated was 43 % and the 75th percentile was 71 % .  The median EP for medication  initiation was 22 % and the 75th percentile was 34 % .  The median EP for medication  taking was 27.5 % and the 75th percentile was 43 % .  The  EPs for all outcomes were higher for interventions with dedicated personnel to implement the intervention and those within which bone mineral density testing and /or treatment were included . In studies with  an  EP , up to 71 % of patients were investigated for OP , but < 35 % initiated medication , and < 45 % were taking medication within 6 months of screening . Calculating an EP allowed us to compare outcomes across the studies , therefore capturing both RCTs and other study design s typical of real-world setting."

"dBACKGROUND  Geriatric assessment  is a multidisciplinary diagnostic process that evaluates the  older adult  's medical , psychological , social , and functional capacity . No systematic review of the use of  geriatric assessment  in oncology has been conducted . The goals of this systematic review were : 1 ) to provide an overview of all  geriatric assessment instruments  used in the  oncology setting ;  2 ) to examine the feasibility and psychometric properties of those instruments ; and 3 ) to systematic ally evaluate the effectiveness of  geriatric assessment  in predicting or modifying outcomes ( including the impact on  treatment decision making , toxicity of treatment ,  and  mortality )  . METHODS We search ed Medline  , Embase , Psychinfo , Cinahl  ,  and the Cochrane Library  for  articles published in English , French , Dutch , or German between January 1 , 1996 , and November 16 , 2010  , reporting on  cross-sectional , longitudinal ,  interventional ,  or observational  studies that assessed the feasibility or effectiveness of  geriatric assessment instruments .  The quality of articles was evaluated using relevant quality assessment frameworks . RESULTS We identified  83 articles that reported on 73 studies .  The quality of most studies was poor to moderate . Eleven studies examined  psychometric properties or diagnostic accuracy  of the   geriatric assessment  instruments  used . The assessment generally took 10 - 45 min .   Geriatric assessment   was most often completed to  describe a patient 's health and functional status .  Specific domains of   geriatric assessment   were associated with  treatment toxicity  in 6 of 9 studies and with  mortality  in 8 of 16 studies . Of the four studies that examined the  impact of  geriatric assessment   on the cancer treatment decision , two found that  geriatric assessment  impacted 40%-50 % of treatment decisions .   Geriatric  assessment   in the  oncology setting  is  feasible  , and some domains are associated with  adverse outcomes .  However , there is limited evidence that  geriatric assessment  impacted treatment decision making . Further research examining the effectiveness of  geriatric assessment  on treatment decisions and outcomes is needed."
"8Purpose The objective of this systematic review was to identify , collate and analyse the current available evidence on the effectiveness of  workplace-based rehabilitative interventions  in  workers with upper limb conditions on  work performance , pain , absenteeism , productivity and other outcomes .   Methods We search ed Medline , Cochrane Library , Scopus , Web of Science , Academic Search Premier , Africa-Wide Information , CINAHL , OTSeeker and PEDro with search terms in four broad areas : upper limb , intervention , workplace and clinical trial ( no date limits ) . Studies including  neck pain only or musculoskeletal pain  in other areas were not included . Results Initial search located  1071 articles , of which 80 were full text review ed .  Twenty-eight articles were included , reporting on various  outcomes  relating to a total of seventeen studies . Nine studies were of high method ological quality , seven of medium quality , and one of low quality . Studies were sorted into intervention categories :  Ergonomic controls  ( n = 3 ) ,  ergonomic training and workstation adjustments  ( n = 4 ) ,  exercise and resistance training  ( n = 6 ) ,  clinic-based versus workplace-based work hardening  ( n = 1 ) ,  nurse case manager training  ( n = 1 ) ,  physiotherapy versus Feldenkrais  ( n = 1 ) , and  ambulant myofeedback training  ( n = 1 ) . The largest body of evidence supported  workplace exercise programs  , with positive  effects  for  ergonomic training  and  workstation  adjustments , and mixed effects for ergonomic controls .  Ambulant myofeedback training  had no effect . The remaining three categories had  positive effects  in the single study on each intervention . Conclusion While there is substantial evidence for  workplace exercise programs  , other workplace-based interventions require further high quality research .

"sThe numbers of  quality -adjusted life years  ( QALYs ) gained are increasingly being used to represent the gains in individual utility from treatment . This requires that the value of a health improvement to an individual is a simple product of gains in  quality of life  and  length of life .  The article reports on a systematic review of the literature on 2 issues : whether the value of a state is affected by how long the state lasts , and by states that come before or after it . It was found that  individual preferences over health  are influenced by the  duration of health states  and their  sequence  . However , although there is much variation across individual respondents , the assumptions tend to hold much better when valuations are aggregated across respondents , which is encouraging for economic evaluations that rely on using average ( mean or median ) values."
"3Introduction Type  2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )  affects more than 1.1 million  Canadians aged ≥65 years .   Group Medical Visits  are an emerging health service delivery method . Recent systematic review s show that they can significantly reduce  glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels  , but Group Visits have not been evaluated within primary care . We intend to determine the  clinical effectiveness , quality of life  and  economic  implication s of  Group Medical Visits  within a primary care setting for  older people with T2DM .  Methods and analysis A 2-year proof-of-concept , single-blinded ( measurement team ) r and omised control trial to test the efficacy of  Group Medical Visits  in an  urban Canadian primary care setting . Participants ≥65 years old with T2DM ( N=128 ) will  be equally r and omised to either eight groups of  eight patients each ( Group Medical Visits ; Intervention ) or to Individual visits ( St and ard Care ; Controls )  . Those administering co interventions are not blinded to group assignment . Our sample size is based on estimates of variance ( ±1.4 % for HbA1c ) and effect size ( 0.9/1.4=0.6 ) from the literature and from our own preliminary data .  Forty participants  per group will provide a β likelihood of 0.80 , assuming an α of 0.05 . A conservative estimation of an effect size of 0.7/1.4 changes the N in the power calculation to 59 per group .  Hence  ,  we aim to enrol 64 participants in each study arm .  We will use intention-to-treat analysis and  compare mean HbA1c ( % glycosylated HbA1c )  ( primary outcome ) of Intervention/Control participants at 12 months , 24 months and 1 year postintervention  on selected clinical , patient-rated and economic measures  . Trial registration number NCT02002143."
" There is a consistency of findings across studies and a range of outcome measures related to  functional independence  ;  regular aerobic activity and short-term exercise programmes  confer a  reduced risk of functional limitations and disability  in older age . Although a precise characterization of a minimal or effective physical activity dose to maintain functional independence is difficult , it appears moderate to higher levels of activity are effective and there may be a threshold of at least moderate activity for significant outcomes."
" Six core scales were identified with a broad range of symptom items but with limited information on their psychometric properties . There were numerous derivative scales reported , most of which have not been method ically developed or subjected to scientific scrutiny . Despite this , they do make a contribution to the detection , assessment and return to play decisions but there is a need for the clinical user to be aware that many of these scales have "" evolved "" rather than being scientifically developed."
"pAIMS Left atrial ( LA ) enlargement is associated with  atrial fibrillation ( AF ) .  However , it is controversial whether dilated atrium can predict post-ablation AF recurrence . We undertook a systematic review and meta- analysis to analyse the association between LA diameter and   AF recurrence  after  single circumferential pulmonary vein isolation ( CPVI )   and explore the potential mechanism . METHODS AND RESULTS Electronic data bases and bibliographies of retrieved studies were search ed . The anteroposterior diameters of LA were available in all included studies , which were measured at end-systole by  M-mode transthoracic echocardiography .  Subgroup analysis was conducted based on the duration of follow-up .  Weighted mean difference ( WMD )  and  95 % confidence interval ( CI )  were calculated using r and om-effect or fixed-effect model , depending on statistical heterogeneity .  Twenty-two studies with a total of 3750 individuals met the inclusion criteria .  The  summary WMD of LA diameter  between  patients with  and  without recurrence  was 1.87 mm ( 95 % CI 1.26 - 2.48 , P < 0.001 ) . Meta-regression analysis of the 22 studies indicated that study design , duration of  follow-up  , and  measurement of asymptomatic recurrences  were significant sources of heterogeneity . Sensitivity analysis suggested that the  difference in LA diameter  between patients with and without recurrences persisted regardless of the duration of follow-up .  Dilated LA significantly increases the risk of AF recurrence after   single  CPVI  . This is especially applicable to the patients with long-term follow-up."
" The knowledge in the field of advanced and metastatic PCa and CRPC is changing rapidly . The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for use in clinical practice .

PATIENT SUMMARY In  men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only  , it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since  survival and quality of life  may never be affected in many of these patients . For  patients diagnosed with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer  , several new drugs have become available which may provide a clear  survival  benefit but the optimal choice will have to be made on an individual basis."
" This review indicates that  ECT  , combined with  pharmacotherapy  , may be a viable option for a selected group of  patients  with  schizophrenia .  In particular , the use of  ECT  is recommended for  drug-resistant patients  , for  schizophrenic patients with catatonia , aggression or suicidal  behavior   , and when rapid global improvement and reduction of  acute symptomatology  are required."
"sAnxiety disorders are chronic and functionally disabling conditions with high psychological stress , characterised by cognitive symptoms of excessive worry and focus difficulties and physiological symptoms such as muscle tension and insomnia . Gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system and is a key target of pharmacotherapies in the treatment of  anxiety .  Although current pharmaceutical treatments are often efficacious , they may cause undesirable side effects including  cognitive decrements  and  withdrawal symptoms .   Plant-based "" phytomedicines ""  may provide novel treatment options , to act as an adjunctive or alternative to existing anxiolytic medications . As such , we conducted a systematic review to assess the current body of literature on anxiolytic phytomedicines and /or phytoconstituents . An open-ended search to 5 July 2017 was conducted using MEDLINE ( PubMed ) , Scopus , and Cochrane library online data bases and performed in a stepped format from pre clinical to clinical investigations . Eligible studies must have had ( a ) in vitro evidence of GABA-modulating activity , ( b )  animal  studies  using anxiety models  to test an anxiolytic effect , and ( c ) human clinical trials . Ten phytomedicines were identified as having pre clinical investigations showing interaction with the GABA system , in addition to human clinical trials : kava , valerian , pennywort , hops , chamomile , Ginkgo biloba , passionflower , ashwag and ha , skullcap , and lemon balm . Collectively , the literature reveals pre clinical and clinical evidence for various phytomedicines modulating  GABA-pathways  , with comparative  anxiolytic effect  to the current array of pharmaceuticals , along with good safety and tolerability profiles."
"eProblems with timing and time perception have been suggested as key characteristics of  autism spectrum condition ( ASC ) .  Studies and personal accounts from clinicians , parents , caregivers , and self-reports from  autistic people  themselves often refer to problems with time . Although a number of empirical studies have examined aspects relating to time in  autistic individuals  , there remains no clear consensus on whether or how timing mechanisms may be affected in autism . A key reason for this lack of clarity is the wide range of timing processes that exist and subsequently the wide range of method ologies , research paradigms , and sample s that time-based studies have used with  autism population s.  In order to summarize and organize the available literature on this issue , a systematic review was conducted . Five electronic data bases were consulted .  From an initial 597 records ( after duplicates were removed ) , 45 papers were selected and  review ed . The studies are review ed within different sections based on the different types of timing ability that have been explored in the  neurotypical ( NT ) population :  time sensitivity , interval timing , and higher-order time perception . Within each section cognitive models , method ologies , possible clinical implication s , and research results are discussed . The results show different  consistency  across studies between the three types of timing ability . The highest consistency of  results  showing  atypical time perception abilities  is found in  high-level time perception  studies . It remains unclear if autism is characterized by a fundamental  time perception  impairment . Suggestions for future research are discussed . Autism Res 2019 , © 2019 International Society for Autism Research , Wiley Periodicals , Inc. LAY SUMMARY : This systematic review examines the different types of  timing and time perception behavior  that have been investigated in  autism .  Overall , there are a number of studies that show differences between  autistic and non-autistic individuals  , but some studies do not find such differences . Group differences are more consistent across studies using complex tasks rather than simpler more fundamental timing tasks . We suggest that experiments across a range of timing tasks would be fruitful to address gaps in our knowledge."
"eVitamin D deficiency is associated with the risk of  tuberculosis ( TB ) infection  [ 1,2 ] . Vitamin D deficient individuals have a greater susceptibility to developing TB [ 3 ] and worse disease progression if infected with TB [ 4,5 ] . The likely mechanism through which  vitamin D  may prevent or limit infection by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis is through the binding of the bioactive form of  vitamin D ( 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol )  to the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) , a polymorphic nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of genes important for immune function and involved in cytokine production [ 6–8 ] . The VDR is present in immune cells [ 9,10 ] and bronchial and pulmonary epithelial cells [ 11,12 ] , and is up-regulated following the ligation of specific toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) during an antimicrobial response [ 13,14 ] . Through this mechanism , calcitriol induces several endogenous antimicrobial peptides [ 15,16 ] , specifically cathelicidin LL-37 and b defensin [ 13,16 ] , and suppresses matrix metalloproteinase enzymes that de grade the pulmonary extracellular matrix [ 17 ] . Though  vitamin D  was used to treat TB during the pre-antibiotic era , trials in recent years have continued to assess its role in the treatment and prevention of TB . A systematic review published this month in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Endocrinology by Sutaria et al. [ 18 ] evaluated the results from 21 r and omized  , controlled  trials in order to assess : the relationship between low  vitamin D  status and TB , the link between VDR polymorphisms and TB susceptibility , and the role of  vitamin D supplementation  in TB treatment and prevention . Sutaria et al. concluded that : 1 )  individuals  with TB had lower   vitamin  D  status  ( lower serum levels of 25(OH)D  [ 19 ] ) than healthy , age-matched , and sex-matched controls , 2 ) people with certain VDR polymorphisms ( BsmI and FokI ) had increased  susceptibility to TB  , and 3 )  TB patients  receiving  vitamin D supplementation  had improved outcomes in a majority of studies [ 18 ] . Similar to Sutaria et al. [ 18 ] , our recent systematic review regarding  vitamin D supplementation  in infectious disease [ 20 ] found 9 of 11 prospect i ve , controlled trials in  TB patients  to have at least 1 positive outcome in response to  vitamin D therapy . Vitamin D  supplements  promoted anti-mycobacterial activity  [ 21 ] , improved  clinical outcomes ( improved weight gain [  22,23  ] and decreased tissue involvement on imaging studies [  22,23  ]  ) ,  increased sputum smear and culture conversion  [ 24,25 ] ,  reduced inflammation  [ 26 ] , and  increased mediators of anti-microbial activity  ( cathelicidin LL37 [ 27 ] and IFN-g [ 22 ] ) . However , these results were not necessarily primary endpoints in their respective studies or applicableoutsideof specific subgroups . Furthermore , other studies had negative."

" Based on the two major r and omised trials ( HELAS 2006 ; WASH 2004 ) , there is no convincing evidence that  oral anticoagulant therapy  modifies  mortality or vascular events  in  patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm .  Although oral anticoagulation is indicated in certain groups of  patients with heart failure  ( for example those with atrial fibrillation ) , the available data does not support the routine use of anticoagulation in heart failure patients who remain in sinus rhythm."
"sBACKGROUND We review ed systematic ally the results of genetic studies investigating associations between  putative susceptibility genes for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD )  and neuropsychological traits relevant for this disorder . METHODS We identified papers for review through the PubMed data base . RESULTS  Twenty-nine studies examined 10 genes ( DRD4 , DAT1 , COMT , DBH , MAOA , DRD5 , ADRA2A , GRIN2A , BDNF and TPH2 )  in relation to neuropsychological  traits  relevant for  ADHD .  For DRD4 , the   continuous performance test ( CPT )   and  derived tasks  were the most used tests . Association of  high reaction time variability  with the 7-repeat allele absence appears to be the most consistent result and seems to be specific to ADHD .  Speed of processing , set-shifting and cognitive impulsiveness  were less frequently investigated but seem to be altered in the  7-repeat allele carriers  . No effect of genotype was found on  response inhibition  ( the stop and go/no-go tasks ) . For DAT1 , 4 studies provide conflicting results in relation to  omission and commission errors  from  CPT  and  derived  tasks  .   High reaction time variability  seems to be the most replicated cognitive marker associated with the 10-repeat homozygosity . The other genes have attracted fewer studies , and the reported findings need to be replicated . LIMITATIONS Although we aim ed to perform a formal meta- analysis , this was not possible because the number of studies using the same neurocognitive endophenotypes was limited . We referred only minimally to the various theoretical frameworks in this field of research ; more detail would have been beyond the scope of our systematic review . Finally , sample sizes in most of the studies we review ed were small . Thus , some negative findings could be attributed to a lack of statistical power , and positive results should be considered preliminary until they are replicated in extended sample s.  Several method ological issues , including measurement errors , developmental changes in cognitive abilities , sex , psychostimulant effects and presence of comorbid conditions , represent confounding factors and may explain conflicting results."

"eThe impact of  25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25[OH]D ) supplementation  on  weight change  remains controversial . The objective of this study was to summarize the effects of  25[OH]D supplementation ( cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol )  on  BMI change  through a meta- analysis of published clinical trials . We completed a systematic review of English articles , using MEDLINE ( Ovid , Pubmed ) from January 1 , 1998 through January 1 , 2013 . The articles selected focused on  25[OH]D supplementation  and  body mass index ( BMI )  in r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ' s ) . The association between 25[OH]D and mean  BMI change  was estimated utilizing a r and om effects model . A total of  30 studies  were review ed and 9 were included in the meta- analysis .  Total participants included 1651 adults ( 82.6 % women and mean age 47.9 years ) and mean follow-up ranged between 6 to 196 weeks and mean daily 25[OH]D dose ranged from 200 IU to 1,110 IU .  Five of the 9 studies included  calcium  supplementation in both groups .  Average baseline BMI  was 30.7 and 30.4 kg/m2 in the intervention and control groups , respectively . Five studies suggested a  beneficial effect  for 25[OH]D supplementation  for BMI change  whereas 3 studies showed no effect of 25[OH]D supplementation  on BMI change  , and one showed a  non-perceptible change .  Meta-  analysis of BMI values  at end of trial showed no statistically significant difference  in BMI change  by use of  25[OH]D supplementation  . Based on existing published trials , oral  25[OH]D  supplementation does not significantly impact BMI change."
"  RA-related work-disability rates  were similar in the  USA and European countries .  An apparent decrease in the prevalence of  RA-related work disability  since the 1970s may be related to a decrease in physically dem and ing work rather than to epidemiologic changes in RA . The majority of the literature addresses  permanent disability and temporary work loss ;  none of the studies review ed reported the effect of RA on presenteeism , i.e. work limitation from the employer perspective , and there are few published studies of the effectiveness of  disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs  in reducing work-related productivity loss."
">Increasing epidemiological studies suggest that there is an association between  vitamin D  deficiency and risk of  type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )  . Therefore , r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) have been performed to observe the effect of  vitamin D supplementation  on preventing  T2DM  , decreasing  fasting plasma glucose ( FPG )  and improving  insulin resistance  to confirm the association between vitamin  D  and T2DM . However , the results of RCTs on controlling FPG level , improving  insulin resistance  and preventing  T2DM  in non-diabetics are inconsistent . In the present study , a systematic meta- analysis considering individual variation and intervention strategy was conducted to establish an objective and definitive conclusion . The results suggested  that vitamin D supplementation  had no significant effect on  controlling FPG level  ,  improving insulin resistance  or  preventing T2DM  in non-diabetics in a pooled meta- analysis of 23 articles ( containing  28  RCTs ) . However , stratified analysis indicated  that supplementation of vitamin D  had differential effects  on FPG control , insulin sensitivity improvement and T2DM prevention  in individuals with different  baseline   states : FPG  was decreased for those with BMI < 25 ( P=0.048 ) or 20≤ 25(OH)D < 30 ng/ml ( P=0.002 )  ; insulin resistance  was improved for those with 25(OH)D ≥30 ng/ml ( P=0.021 ) ;  and risk of T2DM  was lower for pre-diabetic individuals ( P=0.047 ) or for those with 25≤ BMI < 30 ( P=0.032 ) . Additionally , the  effect on T2DM prevention  was improved when the supplement dose was > 2,000 IU/day ( P=0.047 ) and with intervention without calcium ( P=0.047 ) . Thus , further trials should focus on individual baselines and  the supplementation strategy of vitamin D  in  the prevention of T2DM ."

"dOBJECTIVE  Lateral wedge insoles  are intended to reduce biomechanical risk factors of  medial knee osteoarthritis ( OA )  progression , such as increased knee joint load ; however , there has been no definitive consensus on this topic . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to establish the within-subject effects of  lateral wedge insoles  on knee joint load in  people with medial knee OA during walking .  METHODS  Six data bases were search ed from inception until February 13 , 2015 .  Included studies reported on the immediate biomechanical effects of  lateral wedge insoles  during walking in  people with medial knee OA .  Primary outcomes of interest relating to the biomechanical risk of disease progression were the  first and second peak external knee adduction moment ( EKAM ) and knee adduction angular impulse ( KAAI )  . Eligible studies were pooled using r and om-effects meta- analysis . RESULTS  Eighteen studies were included with a total of 534 participants .   Lateral wedge insoles  result ed in a small but statistically significant reduction in the  first peak EKAM  ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] -0.19 ; 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] -0.23 , -0.15 ) and  second peak EKAM  ( SMD -0.25 ; 95 % CI -0.32 , -0.19 ) with a low level of heterogeneity ( I(2 ) = 5 % and 30 % , respectively ) . There was a favorable but small reduction in the  KAAI  with  lateral wedge  insoles ( SMD -0.14 ; 95 % CI -0.21 , -0.07 , I(2 ) = 31 % ) .  Risk  of  method  ologic bias scores ( quality index ) ranged from 8 to 13 out of 16 .   Lateral wedge insoles  cause small reductions in the  EKAM  and  KAAI  during walking in  people  with medial knee OA . Current evidence demonstrates that  lateral wedge insoles  appear ineffective at attenuating structural changes in  people with medial knee OA  as a whole and may be better suited to targeted use in biomechanical phenotypes associated with larger reductions in knee load."

"sMDMA  ( "" ecstasy "" )  is widely used as a recreational drug , although there has been some debate about its neurotoxic effects in humans . However , most studies have investigated  subjects with heavy use patterns  , and the effects of transient  MDMA  use are unclear . In this review , we therefore focus on  subjects with moderate use patterns  , in order to assess the evidence for harmful effects . We search ed for studies applying  neuroimaging techniques  in  man . Studies were included if they provided at least one group with an average of < 50 lifetime episodes of ecstasy use or an average lifetime consumption of < 100 ecstasy tablets .  All studies published before July 2015 were included . Of the  250 studies identified in the data base search , 19 were included .  There is no convincing evidence that moderate  MDMA  use is associated with  structural or functional brain alterations in neuroimaging measures  . The lack of significant results was associated with high method ological heterogeneity in terms of dosages and co-consumption of other drugs , low quality of studies and  small  sample sizes."
" The  thienopyridine derivatives  are at least as effective as aspirin in preventing  serious vascular events  in  patients at high  risk , and possibly somewhat more so . However , the size of any additional benefit is uncertain and could be negligible .  Clopidogrel  has a more favourable adverse  effects profile  than  ticlopidine  and so is the thienopyridine of choice . It should be used as an alternative to aspirin in patients genuinely intolerant of or allergic to aspirin."
"KBACKGROUND Although the detrimental effects of severe iodine deficiency are well recognised , the benefits of correcting mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency are uncertain . OBJECTIVES We undertook a systematic review of the impact of  iodine supplementation  in  population s with mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency .  METHODS We search ed Medline and the Cochrane library for  relevant articles published between January 1966 and April 2013 ,  which investigated the effect of  iodine supplementation  on  maternal and newborn thyroid function , infant neurodevelopment and cognitive performance in school-age children .  The quality of studies was grade d and eligible trials were evaluated in the meta- analysis . RESULTS  Nine r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs )  and eight observational  studies  met the inclusion criteria . Controlled trials on  infant neurodevelopment  were lacking ; gestational  iodine  supplementation reduced  maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin  and in some studies prevented a rise in  serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .  None of the intervention trials recorded an  excess frequency of thyroid dysfunction  in contrast to observational studies . A pooled analysis of two RCTs which measured  cognitive function  in  school-age children  showed modest benefits of  iodine supplementation  on  perceptual reasoning  ( st and ardised mean difference ( SMD ) 0.55 ; 95 % CI 0.05 , 1.04 ; P=0.03 ) and  global cognitive index  ( SMD 0.27 ; 95 % CI 0.10 , 0.44 ; P=0.002 ) with significant heterogeneity between studies .   Iodine supplementation  improves some  maternal thyroid indices  and may benefit aspects of  cognitive function  in  school-age children  , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas . Further large prospect i ve controlled studies are urgently required to clarify these findings and quantify the risk/ benefits of  iodine supplementation  in regions previously believed to be iodine sufficient such as the UK."
"dBACKGROUND While hypertension is a leading risk factor for an initial stroke , the role of blood pressure lowering to prevent subsequent stroke is less clear . The results of recent large clinical trials investigating effects of  antihypertensive agents  in  patients with a history of stroke  have not shown a significant benefit ; findings that are at odds with previous data . Our meta- analysis systematic ally evaluates the available , relevant trials to examine the role of  antihypertensive drugs  in preventing recurrent stroke . METHODS MEDLINE , CENTRAL , and Clinical Trials.gov were systematic ally search ed and bibliographies from key reports were examined . All r and omized ,  placebo-controlled  trials that tested  blood pressure lowering agents  in  patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack  were identified . The results from these trials were combined and meta-analyses were performed . RESULTS  Ten studies  were found to contain relevant endpoints and presented data allowing meta- analysis . Agents that lowered blood pressure reduced  recurrent stroke  ( OR 0.71 , 95 % CI 0.59 - 0.86 , P = 0.0004 ) and  cardiovascular events  ( OR 0.69 , 95 % CI 0.57 - 0.85 , P = 0.0004 ) in  patients  with a previous stroke or TIA . These agents did not affect the  rate of myocardial infa rct ion  ( OR 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.73 - 1.01 , P = 0.07 ) or  all-cause mortality  ( OR 0.95 , 95 % CI 0.83 - 1.07 , P = 0.39 ) in this  patient population .   Despite recent large trials showing no significant effect , in  patients  that have experienced a TIA or stroke ,  blood pressure lowering  agents reduced the occurrence  of subsequent stroke and cardiovascular events .  The  rate of myocardial infa rct ion and all-cause mortality  was unchanged."

Search terms included cognitive function , neurocognitive function/performance , executive function , impulsivity , self-regulation , effortful control , cognitive control , inhibition , delayed gratification , memory , attention , language , motor , visuo-spatial , academic achievement , obesity ,  overweight  ,  body mass index , waist-hip ratio , adiposity and body fat . Articles were excluded if participants had health problems known to affect cognitive functioning , the study used imaging as the only outcome measure , they were non-peer- review ed dissertations , theses , review papers , commentaries , or they were non-English articles . Sixty-seven studies met inclusion criteria for this review  . Overall , we found data that support a negative relationship between  obesity and  various  aspects of neurocognitive functioning  , such  as executive functioning , attention , visuo-spatial performance , and motor skill .  The existing literature is mixed on the effects among  obesity , general cognitive functioning , language , learning , memory , and academic achievement . Executive dysfunction  is associated with obesity-related behaviors , such as  increased intake , disinhibited eating  , and  less physical activity .  Physical  activity  is positively linked with  motor skill .  More longitudinal research is needed to determine the directionality of such relationships , to point towards crucial intervention time periods in the development of children , and to inform effective treatment programs."
"sThere is a need for easily accessible tuberculosis unit cost data , as well as an underst and ing of the variability of methods used and reporting st and ards of that data . The aim of this systematic review was to descriptively review papers reporting  tuberculosis unit costs  from a  healthcare provider perspective  looking at method ological variation ; to assess quality using a study quality rating system and machine learning to investigate the indicators of reporting quality ; and to identify the data gaps to inform st and ardised tuberculosis unit cost collection and consistent principles for reporting going forward . We search ed grey and published literature in five sources and eight data bases , respectively , using search terms linked to cost , tuberculosis and tuberculosis health services including tuberculosis treatment and prevention . For inclusion , the  papers needed  to contain  empirical unit cost estimates for tuberculosis interventions from low- and middle-income countries , with reference years between 1990 and 2018 .  A total of  21,691 papers were found and screened  in a phased manner . Data were extracted from the eligible papers into a detailed Microsoft Excel tool , extensively cleaned and analysed with R software ( R Project , Vienna , Austria ) using the user interface of RStudio . A study quality rating was applied to the review ed papers based on the inclusion or omission of a selection of variables and their relative importance . Following this ,  machine learning  using a recursive partitioning method was utilised to construct a classification tree to assess the reporting quality . This systematic review included  103 provider perspective papers with 627 unit costs ( costs not  presented  here ) for tuberculosis interventions among a total of 140 variables .  The interventions covered were active , passive and intensified case finding ; tuberculosis treatment ; above-service costs ; and tuberculosis prevention . Passive case finding is the detection of tuberculosis cases where individuals self-identify at health facilities ; active case finding is detection of cases of those not in health facilities , such as through outreach ; and intensified case finding is detection of cases in high-risk population s. There was heterogeneity in some of the reported methods used such cost allocation , amortisation and the use of top-down , bottom-up or mixed approaches to the costing . Uncertainty checking through sensitivity analysis was only reported on by half of the papers ( 54 % ) , while purposive and convenience sampling was reported by 72 % of papers . Machine learning indicated that reporting on ‘ Intervention ’ ( in particular ) , ‘ Urbanicity ’ and ‘ Site Sampling ’ , were the most likely indicators of quality of reporting . The largest data gap identified was for  tuberculosis vaccination cost data  , the  Bacillus Calmette  – Guérin  ( BCG ) vaccine  in particular . There is a gap in available unit costs for 12 of  30 high tuberculosis burden countries  , as well as for the interventions of above-service costs , tuberculosis prevention , and active and intensified case finding . Variability in the methods and reporting used makes comparison difficult and makes it hard for decision makers to know which unit costs they can trust . The  study quality rating system  used in this review as well as the classification tree enable focus on specific reporting aspects that should improve variability and increase confidence in unit costs . Research ers should endeavour to be explicit and transparent in how they cost interventions following the principles as laid out in the Global Health Cost Consortium ’s Reference Case for Estimating the  Costs  of Global Health Services and Interventions , which in turn will lead to repeatability , comparability and enhanced learning from others."
">Background A feature of stroke is that it recurs ( 25 % within five-years ) . Risk factors for stroke and recurrent stroke include smoking , alcohol consumption , poor diet , and physical inactivity . Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of  secondary prevention lifestyle interventions design  ed to change lifestyle behavior following stroke . This short paper presents a summary of the systematic review process and findings . Methods  Ten major data  bases were search ed using subject headings and key words . Papers were screened using review -specific criteria . Critical appraisal and data extraction were conducted independently by two review ers . Data were pooled in statistical meta- analysis ; where this was not possible findings were presented in narrative form . Results  Three studies involving 581 participants were review ed .  Two models of intervention delivery were reported : shared care and nurse-led . Interventions were delivered to groups or in one-to-one consultations . Metaanalyses of the pooled lifestyle data favored the interventions ( 2P = 0.02 ) . In terms of physiological outcomes , while overall treatment effect was not significant , pooled results did approach statistical significance ( 2P = 0.08 ) , however the test of heterogeneity was significant , suggesting differences in the variables that were pooled . Pooled secondary outcomes , including  perceived health status and stroke knowledge  , favored the interventions ( 2P # < 0.00001 ) , however , the test for heterogeneity was highly significant . Conclusion  Stroke secondary prevention lifestyle interventions  are effective in terms of effecting positive change in  lifestyle  behaviors and secondary outcomes , and appear promising in relation to physiological outcomes . There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of intervention on incidence  of stroke recurrence ."

"sThe effects of  pycnogenol  on  plasma lipids  are controversial . A systematic review and meta- analysis of clinical trials were conducted to obtain a conclusive result in  humans .  PubMed , Scopus , and Google Scholar were systematic ally search ed until March 2018 , to explore the clinical trials that examined the effect of  pycnogenol supplementation  on lipid parameters  among adult human .  Method ological quality of the eligible studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool . To estimate the effect size , changes in  blood lipids  were implemented . Results were pooled using a r and om effects model . Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis . A systematic review and meta- analysis of  14 clinical trials with 1,065 participants  suggested a significant increase in  plasma concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( HDL-C ; 3.27 mg/dL ; 95 % CI [ 0.19 , 6.36 ] ; p = 0.038 ) . In contrast ,  plasma levels of total cholesterol  ( TC ; -4.45 mg/dL , 95 % CI [ -11.24 , 2.34 ] ; p = 0.199 ) ,  triacylglycerol  ( TAG ; -3.64 mg/dL ; 95 % CI [ -17.89 , 10.61 ] ; p = 0.616 ) , and  low density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( LDL-C ; -3.61 mg/dl ; 95 % CI [ -8.76 , 1.55 ] ; p = 0.171 ) were not altered . Adjustment for confounding variables was poor in included studies . Also , these studies did not assess  dietary lipid  intake . The results indicate  that pycnogenol  supplementation improves  levels of HDL-C ;  however , the  changes in TC , TAG , and LDL-C  were not clinical ly relevant . Since there are few phytochemicals that have a significant increasing effect on  HDL-C  levels   ,  pycnogenol  may have important role in prevention of cardiovascular diseases."
"yBACKGROUND There are studies that show preliminary evidence of the benefits of  physical exercise  for  people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) .  The objective of the research being reported here was to carry out a systematic review of articles relating to the effects that  exercise sessions  have on  children and adolescents with this pathology .  METHOD  The total sample of studies considered was 1,723 , of which only 11 met the eligibility criteria .  RESULTS The research included in this review showed that  children with ADHD  undertaking  exercise  experienced improvements in their characteristic symptoms , mainly  attention deficit and hyperactivity  , in comparison to other sedentary tasks such as  watching a video .  Five minutes of  jumping  or  thirty  minutes  on a treadmill  or  static bicycle  were enough to produce appreciable improvements in  inhibitory control or in cognitive and executive functions .  Benefits following  exercise  were also seen in other aspects such as  reaction times and preparation for response , motor skills or brain activity .   The findings make us optimistic that in the future  physical exercise  may become an alternative , or at least an effective complement , to the pharmacological treatments currently used for this pathology."

"sBackground Recent systematic review s have suggested that  pedometers  may be effective motivational tools to promote walking . However , studies tend to be of a relatively short duration , with small clinical based sample s. Further research is required to demonstrate their effectiveness in adequately powered , community based studies . Objective Using a r and omized controlled trial design , this study assessed the impact of a 12-week  graduated pedometer-based walking intervention  on  daily step-counts , self-reported physical activity and health outcomes  in a  Scottish community sample not meeting current physical activity recommendations .  MethodS  ixty-three women and 16 men ( 49.2 years ± 8.8 ) were r and omly  assigned to either an  intervention ( physical activity consultation and 12-week pedometer-based walking program ) or control ( no action ) group  . Measures  for step-counts , 7-day physical activity recall , affect , quality of life  ( n = 79 )  , body mass , BMI , % body fat , waist and hip circumference  ( n = 76 )  , systolic/diastolic blood pressure , total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol  ( n = 66 ) were taken at baseline and week 12 . Analyses were performed on an intention to treat basis using 2-way mixed factorial analyses of variance for parametric data and Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon tests for non-parametric data . Results Significant increases were found in the intervention group  for step-counts  ( p < .001 ) ,  time spent in leisure  walking ( p = .02 ) and  positive  affect ( p = .027 ) . Significant decreases were found in this group  for time spent in weekday  ( p = .003 ) ,  weekend  ( p = .001 )  and total sitting  ( p = .001 ) with no corresponding changes in the control group . No significant changes in any other health outcomes were found in either group . In comparison with the control group at week 12 , the intervention group reported a significantly  greater number of minutes spent in leisure time  ( p = .008 )  , occupational  ( p = .045 )  and total walking  ( p = .03 ) , and  significantly fewer minutes in time spent in weekend  ( p = .003 )  and total sitting  ( p = .022 ) .  Conclusion A pedometer-based walking program  , incorporating a physical activity consultation , is effective in promoting walking and improving positive affect over 12 weeks in community based individuals . The discussion examines possible explanations for the lack of significant changes in health outcomes . Continued follow-up of this study will examine adherence to the intervention and possible result ing effects on health outcomes."
"DBACKGROUND Physical inactivity is associated with poor outcomes in COPD , and as a result , interventions to  improve physical activity ( PA )  are a current research focus . However , many trials have been small and inconclusive . OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to study the effects of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) targeting PA in COPD . METHODS Data bases ( Physiotherapy Evidence Data base [ PEDro ] , Embase , MEDLINE , CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials ) were search ed using the following keywords :  ""  COPD ""   ,  "" intervention  ""   and   ""  physical activity  ""   from inception to May 20 , 2016 ; published RCTs that aim ed to increase PA  in individuals with COPD  were included . The PEDro scale was used to rate study quality . St and ardized  mean differences ( effect sizes ,  ESs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were determined . Effects of included interventions were also measured according to the  minimal important difference ( MID ) in daily steps  for COPD ( 599 daily steps ) . RESULTS A  total of 37 RCTs with 4,314 participants ( mean  forced expiratory volume in one  second  (  FEV1  )  % predicted 50.5 [ SD=10.4 ] ) were identified  .  Interventions including exercise training  ( ET ; n=3 studies , 103 participants ) significantly  increased PA levels  in COPD compared to st and ard care ( ES [ 95 % CI ] ; 0.84 [ 0.44 - 1.25 ] ) . The  addition of activity counseling to pulmonary rehabilitation  ( PR ; n=4 studies , 140 participants ) showed important  effects on PA levels  compared to PR alone ( 0.47 [ 0.02 - 0.92 ] ) , achieving significant increases that exceeded the MID for daily steps in COPD ( mean difference [ 95 % CI ] , 1,452 daily steps [ 549 - 2,356 ] ) . Reporting of method ological quality was poor in most included RCTs .  Interventions that included  ET and PA counseling  during PR were effective strategies to improve PA in COPD."
" After a first SSRI , any switch within or between classes of antidepressants appears legitimate ( second SSRI , novel dual-acting antidepressants , selective norepinephrine or nor-adrenergic/dopaminergic agents , or tricyclic anti-depressant or mianserin ) . No unequivocal evidence is available to prove an advantage of a between-class switch . More guidance by r and omized empirical studies is needed . Clinical implication s and method ological considerations for future studies are discussed."
"dPURPOSE This paper focuses on the construct validity of instruments measuring  impairments in body structures  and  function  in  rheumatic disorders .  The objective is : 1 ) to make an inventory of constructs , based on the domains of the International Classification of Functioning , Disabilities and Health problems ( ICF ) , against which instruments measuring impairments in body structures and function were vali date d ; 2 ) to analyse whether validation against a similar construct result ed in higher correlation coefficients than validation against a dissimilar construct . METHODS In a systematic review papers were identified in which instruments measuring impairments in body structures  and function  for  patients with rheumatic disorders  were vali date d. The instruments identified were assessed on their method ological properties and the constructs against which they were vali date d. Subsequently , pooled ( interclass ) correlations of similar constructs and dissimilar constructs against which was vali date d were compared . An instrument was decided to have good  construct  validity , if the correlation coefficient was 0.50 or higher , and the measurement instrument in question is vali date d against similar constructs . RESULTS In total  216 papers were identified analysing the   validity  of  42 different instruments .  Only 16 % of these instruments were vali date d against instruments that represent the most similar construct . In general , estimates of  construct validity  were lower when vali date d against dissimilar constructs , except for instruments measuring  impairments in mental functions .   There is a trend that validation against a similar construct yields higher  correlation coefficients  than validation against a dissimilar construct . If an instrument measuring impairments is vali date d against the most similar construct , and a criterion of r > 0.50 is applied , only 10 out of the 42 identified instruments turned out to be valid."
" Advanced   neuroimaging , fluid biomarkers   and  genetic testing  are important research tools , but require further validation to determine their ultimate clinical utility in the evaluation of SRC . Future research efforts should address current gaps that limit clinical translation . Ultimately , research on neurobiological and genetic aspects of SRC is predicted to have major translational significance to evidence -based approaches to clinical management of SRC , much like applied clinical research has had over the past 20 years."
"dOBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to identify if different types  of  indirect restorations  used for single teeth  had different  biological and technical complications  , as well as  survival  rates . METHOD An electronic search was performed in various electronic data bases to identify  articles , published between 1980 and 2017 .  The search terms were categorised into 4 groups :  inlay , onlay , inlay/onlay and crown .  Manual search es of published full-text articles and related review s were also performed . RESULTS  A total number of 2849 papers were retrieved initially .  After a detailed assessment for eligibility ,  9 studies were selected for inclusion .  The heterogeneity of the studies did allow neither a meta- analysis nor any meaningful comparison between types of restorations or material s. Only some pooling was performed for representative reasons . The  mean survival rate  of  inlays  was 90.89 % , while for  onlays  and  crowns  it was 93.50 % and 95.38 % , respectively . For the fourth study group , consisting of both  inlays and onlays  , the  survival rate  was found to be 99.43 % . Statistical analysis demonstrated  caries  to be the main biological complication for all types of restorations , followed by a  root and /or tooth fracture incidence  ( 11.34 % ) and  endodontic incidence . Ceramic fractures  represented the most common  technical complication  , followed by  loss of retention and porcelain chipping .   The  5-year survival rate  for  crowns and inlays/onlays  is very high , exceeding 90 % . An association between the kind of complications and different types of restorations could not be established . Nevertheless , a relatively high  failure rate  due to caries and ceramic fractures was noted."
"eCognitive-behavioural  therapy ( CBT )  and its effects on   temporom and  ibular  disorders  ( TMD )  have been examined in several studies . We are trying to combine results of these studies and to explore the effectiveness . MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial , Pubmed and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Data were search ed to collect r and omised and semi-r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) , comparing  CBT  with any  control group receiving other dental treatments .  Two authors independently retrieved , extracted and assessed the quality of included studies . The search strategy result ed in  323 studies , of which five met the inclusion criteria , including three RCTs and two semi- RCTs .  The quality of the included studies was diverse . Meta- analysis was not performed owing to five studies involving different comparison groups and follow-up periods . The  effect of  CBT  on  patients with TMD   is inconsistent among the studies , so no firm conclusion could be drawn in this systematic review . There is insufficient evidence to make firm recommendations for the use of  CBT  over other intervention for the treatment of TMD . Further high- quality RCTs are clearly needed for this theme."
"nBACKGROUND Many r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and observational studies have provided information on the association between  vitamin B-12  intake and biomarkers . The use of these data to estimate dose-response relations provides a useful means to summarize the body of evidence . OBJECTIVE We systematic ally review ed studies that investigated  vitamin B-12 intake  and biomarkers of  vitamin  B-12   status and estimated dose-response relations with the use of a meta- analysis . DESIGN This systematic review included  all RCTs , prospect i ve cohort studies , nested case-control studies , and cross-sectional studies in healthy adult population s published through January 2010 that  supplied or measured dietary vitamin B-12 intake and measured  vitamin B-12  status  as  serum or plasma vitamin B-12 , methylmalonic acid ( MMA ) ,  or  holotranscobalamin .   We calculated an  intake-status  regression coefficient ( ) for each individual study and calculated the overall pooled and SE ( ) by using r and om-effects meta- analysis on a double-log scale . RESULTS The meta- analysis of observational studies showed a weaker slope of dose-response relations than the meta- analysis of RCTs . The pooled dose-response relation of all studies between  vitamin B-12  intake and status indicated that a doubling of the  vitamin B-12  intake  increased vitamin B-12 concentrations  by 11 % ( 95 % CI : 9.4 % , 12.5 % ) . This increase was larger for studies in  elderly persons  ( 13 % ) than in studies in  adults  ( 8 % ) . The dose-response relation  between  vitamin B-12  intake and MMA concentrations  indicated a decrease in  MMA  of 7 % ( 95 % CI : -10 % , -4 % ) for every doubling of the vitamin  B-12  intake . The assessment of risk of bias within individual studies and across studies indicated risk that was unlikely to seriously alter these results .  The obtained dose-response estimate between  vitamin B-12  intake and status provides complementary evidence to underpin recommendations for a  vitamin B-12  intake of population."
"sSedentary  behaviour  has emerged as a unique determinant of health in  adults .  Studies in  children and adolescents  have been less consistent . We review ed the evidence to determine if the total volume and patterns ( i.e. breaks and bouts ) of objective ly measured sedentary   behaviour   were associated with adverse  health outcomes  in  young people  , independent of moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity physical activity . Four electronic data bases ( EMBASE MEDLINE , Ovid EMBASE , PubMed and Scopus ) were search ed  ( up to 12 November 2015 )  to retrieve  studies among 2- to 18-year-olds  ,  which used cross-sectional , longitudinal or experimental design  s , and examined associations with  health outcomes ( adiposity , cardio-metabolic , fitness , respiratory , bone/musculoskeletal , psychosocial , cognition/academic achievement , gross motor development and other outcomes )  . Based on  88 eligible observational studies  , level of evidence grading and quantitative meta-analyses indicated that there is limited available evidence that the total  volume or patterns of sedentary behaviour  are associated with  health in children and adolescents  when accounting for moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity physical activity or focusing on studies with low risk of bias . Quality evidence from studies with robust design s and methods , objective measures of sitting , examining associations for various health outcomes , is needed to better underst and if the overall volume or patterns of  sedentary behaviour  are independent determinants of health in children and adolescents."
"eBACKGROUND  Functional training  is a new training vision that was prepared from the gesture imitation of daily activities . Although your use has become popular in clinical practice , the influence of the several cardiorespiratory adjustments performed during the  functional training  in different population s and conditions is unknown . So , the aim of this systematic review was to gather information in the literature regarding the influence of  functional training  on  cardiorespiratory parameters .  METHODS We conducted search strategies on MEDLINE , PEDro , EMBASE , SportD iscus and Cochrane to identify r and  omized  controlled trials investigating the effects of  functional training  on  cardiorespiratory parameters  . Method ological quality of the included studies was assessed using the PEDro scale . Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) summarized the evidence . RESULTS Five original studies were included . Effects  favoured  functional training  on oxygen consumption ( VO2 )  at intermediate-term follow-up : weighted mean difference -1·0 ( 95 % CI : 5·4 - 3·3 ) , P = 0·642 , and a small and not clinical  ly important  effect observed  on VO2  favouring control at intermediate-term follow-up ( i.e. mean difference of 1·30 ( 95 % CI 1·07 - 1·53 ) , P<0·001 ) .  According to the GRADE system , there is very low quality evidence  that functional training  is better than other interventions  to improve cardiovascular parameters  . This result encourages new search es about the theme."
"sNeck pain occurs frequently in  western societies .  In the majority of cases , no specific cause can be identified . In order to gain insight into the clinical course and prognostic factors of non-specific neck pain , a systematic review was conducted . A computerized literature search was carried out to identify observational studies on  non-specific neck pain  and r and  omized clinical trials ( RCTs )  on  conservative treatment  of non-specific  neck pain .  Two review ers scored independently , the method ological quality of all identified publications , using a st and ardized set of 13 criteria which were divided into five categories according to : study population , study design , follow-up , outcome measures and analysis / data presentation . To determine prognosis per study , an  overall percentage of recovery  for the most important outcome measures  ( pain , general improvement , functional status , health care utilization and lost days of work )  was calculated . In total  23 eligible publications were identified ( six observational  studies  and 17  RCTs  )  . Only seven of 23 studies scored 50 % or more of the 13 items , indicating a generally poor quality of methods . The most prevalent method ological shortcomings appeared to be selection of the study population , the sample size and analysis techniques . Most information regarding the clinical course is available for the group of  patients with complaints for more than 6 months , who are treated in a secondary care or an occupational setting .  In this group of patients , 46 % ( median ) had less  pain  , with a range of 22 - 79 % and a general improvement that ranged between 37 and 95 % ( 47 % median ) . The  reduction in the use of  analgesics   ranged between 32 and 80 % ( 37 % median ) . Six studies reported on prognostic factors . Bearing in mind the limited number of studies and the low method ological quality , there are some indications that the localization ( radiation to the arms/neurologic signs ) and radiologic findings ( degenerative changes in the discs and joints ) are not associated with a worse prognosis . A higher  severity of pain  and a history of  previous attacks  however , seems to be associated with a worse prognosis."
"nINTRODUCTION The use of drugs to enhance recovery ( "" rehabilitation pharmacology "" ) has been assessed .  Amphetamine  can improve outcome in experimental models of stroke , and several small clinical trials have assessed its use in stroke . METHODS Electronic search es were performed to identify  r and omised controlled trials of  amphetamine  in stroke ( ischaemic or haemorrhagic ) .  Outcomes included  functional outcome  ( assessed as combined  death or disability/dependency ) , safety ( death ) and haemodynamic measures .  Data were analysed as dichotomous or continuous outcomes , using odds ratios ( OR ) , weighted or st and ardised mean difference , ( WMD or SMD ) using r and om-effects models with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) ; statistical heterogeneity was assessed . RESULTS  Eleven completed trials ( n=329 ) were identified .  Treatment with  amphetamine  was associated with non-significant trends to increased  death  ( OR 2.78 ( 95 % CI , 0.75 - 10.23 ) , n=329 , 11 trials ) and  improved motor scores  ( WMD 3.28 ( 95 % CI -0.48 - 7.04 ) n=257 , 9 trials ) but had no effect on the combined outcome of  death and dependency  ( OR 1.15 ( 95 % CI 0.65 - 2.06 , n=206 , 5 trials ) .  Amphetamine  increased  systolic blood pressure  ( WMD 9.3 mmHg , 95 % CI 3.3 - 15.3 , n=106 , 3 trials ) and  heart rate  ( WMD 7.6 beats per minute ( bpm ) , 95 % CI 1.8 - 13.4 , n=106 , 3 trials ) . Despite variations in treatment regimes , outcomes and follow-up duration there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity or publication bias .  No evidence exists at present to support the use of  amphetamine  after stroke . Despite a trend to improved  motor function  , doubts remain over safety and there are significant haemodynamic  effects  , the consequences of which are unknown."
" Some statistically significant differences between  citalopram  and other  antidepressants  for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of  efficacy , tolerability and acceptability .   Citalopram  was more  efficacious  than  paroxetine and reboxetine  and more  acceptable  than  tricyclics , reboxetine and venlafaxine  , however , it seemed to be less  efficacious  than  escitalopram .  As with most systematic review s in psychopharmacology , the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias and publication bias should be borne in mind when interpreting review findings .  Economic analyses  were not reported in the included studies , however ,  cost effectiveness  information is needed in the field of antidepressant trials."
"hModerate-to-vigorous  physical activity ( MVPA )  is essential for disease prevention and health promotion . Emerging evidence suggests other intensities of  physical activity ( PA )  , including  light-intensity activity  ( LPA  )  , may also be important , but there has been no rigorous evaluation of the evidence . The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the relationships between objective ly measured PA ( total and all intensities ) and  health  indicators in  school-aged children and youth .  Online data bases were search ed for peer- review ed studies that met the a priori inclusion criteria :  population ( apparently healthy , aged 5 - 17 years )  , intervention/exposure/comparator ( volumes , duration s , frequencies , intensities , and patterns of objective ly measured PA ) , and outcome  ( body composition , cardiometabolic biomarkers , physical fitness , behavioural conduct/pro-social behaviour , cognition/academic achievement , quality of life/well-being , harms , bone health , motor skill development , psychological distress , self-esteem ) .  Heterogeneity among studies precluded meta-analyses ; narrative synthesis was conducted .  A total of 162 studies were included ( 204 171 participants from 31 countries ) .  Overall ,  total PA  was favourably associated  with physical , psychological/social , and cognitive health indicators .  Relationships were more consistent and robust for higher ( e.g. , MVPA ) versus lower ( e.g. , LPA ) intensity PA . All patterns of activity ( sporadic , bouts , continuous ) provided benefit .  LPA  was favourably associated  with cardiometabolic biomarkers ;  data were scarce for other outcomes . These findings continue to support the importance of at least 60 min/day of MVPA for disease prevention and health promotion in children and youth , but also highlight the potential benefits of  LPA  and  total PA .  All intensities of  PA  should be considered in future work aim ed at better elucidating the health benefits of  PA  in children and youth."

">Abstract Bennett , H , Davison , K , Arnold , J , Slattery , F , Martin , M , and Norton , K.  Multicomponent musculoskeletal movement assessment tools :  a systematic review and critical appraisal of their development and applicability to professional practice . J Strength Cond Res 31(10 ) : 2903–2919 , 2017—Multicomponent  movement assessment tools  have become commonplace to measure movement quality , proposing to indicate injury risk and performance capabilities . Despite popular use , there has been no attempt to compare the components of each tool reported in the literature , the processes in which they were developed , or the underpinning rationale for their included content . As such , the objective of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive summary of current movement assessment tools and appraise the evidence supporting their development . A systematic literature search was performed using PRISMA guidelines to identify  multicomponent movement assessment tools .  Commonalities between tools and the evidence provided to support the content of each tool was identified . Each tool underwent critical appraisal to identify the rigor in which it was developed , and its applicability to professional practice .  Eleven tools were  identified , of which 5 provided evidence to support their content as assessment s of movement quality . One assessment tool (  Soccer Injury Movement Screen  [ SIMS ] ) received an overall score of above 65 % on critical appraisal , with a further 2 tools  ( Movement Competency Screen [ MCS ] and modified 4  movement  screen [ M4-MS ] )  scoring above 60 % . Only the MCS provided clear justification for its developmental process . The remaining 8 tools scored between 40 and 60 % . On appraisal , the MCS , M4-MS , and SIMS seem to provide the most practical value for assessing movement quality as they provide the strongest reports of developmental rigor and an identifiable evidence base . In addition , considering the evidence provided , these tools may have the strongest potential for identifying performance capabilities and guiding exercise prescription in  athletic and sport-specific population ."
"DBACKGROUND  Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD )  is a prevalent and disabling condition . Evidence that PTSD is characterized by specific psychobiological dysfunctions has contributed to a growing interest in use of  medication  in its treatment . OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of  medication  in the treatment of  PTSD  . DESIGN Systematic review of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) following the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines . A more detailed version of the review is published in the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s. METHODS We search ed the  Cochrane Depression , Anxiety and Neurosis Group specialised register  ,  the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( Cochrane Library issue 4  , 2004 ) ,  MEDLINE (  January 1966 - December 2004 ) , PsycINFO  (  1966 -  2004  ) ,  the National PTSD Center Pilots data base  ,  and the meta register module of the Controlled Trials data base  . Reference lists of retrieved articles were search ed for additional studies . Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review , collated trial data , and assessed trial quality . Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data . Summary statistics were stratified by medication class , and by medication agent for the  selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors  (  SSRIs )  . Dichotomous and continuous measures were calculated using a r and om effects model , heterogeneity was assessed , and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were done . MAIN RESULTS Thirty-five short-term ( 14 weeks or less ) RCTs were included in the  analysis ( 4 597 participants )  .  Symptom severity  for 17 trials was significantly reduced in the medication groups , relative to placebo ( weighted mean difference ( WMD ) = -5.76 , 95 % confidence interval (CI)-8.16 - -3.36 , N = 2 507 ) . Similarly , summary statistics for responder status from 13 trials demonstrated overall superiority of a variety of medication agents compared with placebo ( relative risk ( RR ) = 1.49 , 95 % CI : 1.28 , 1.73 , number needed to treat ( NNT ) = 4.85 , N = 1 272 ) .   Medication  and  placebo  response  occurred in 59.1 % ( N = 644 ) and 38.5 % ( N = 628 ) of patients , respectively . Of the medication classes , evidence of  treatment efficacy  was most convincing for the SSRIs . Medication was also effective in reducing  the severity of the PTSD re-experiencing/intrusion , avoidance/numbing , and hyperarousal symptom clusters  in 9 trials ( N = 1 304 ) . In addition , medication was superior to placebo in reducing   comorbid depression and disability .  Medication  was also less  well tolerated  than placebo . A narrative review of the 3 maintenance trials suggested that long-term medication may be required in treating PTSD .   Medication treatments  can be effective in treating PTSD , acting to reduce its core symptoms , as well as associated  depression and disability  , and should be considered as part of the treatment of this disorder . The findings of this review support the status of SSRIs as first-line agents in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD , as well as their value in longterm treatment . However , there remain important gaps in the evidence base , and there is a continued need for more effective agents in the management of PTSD."

"sVitamin D deficiency is associated with a variety of skeletal , cardiometabolic , and immunologic co-morbidities that are present in  chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) .  We performed a systematic review to investigate the effects of  vitamin D supplementation  , in the form of  ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol  , on various  health outcomes  in  early CKD . Seventeen clinical trials were identified  , only two of which were r and omized ,  placebo  controlled trials . The majority of studies supplementing with > 2,000 IU/day of  cholecalciferol  achieved  optimal vitamin D status  , whereas studies supplementing with  ergocalciferol  were less consistent . Studies varied widely in their effects on  lowering serum parathyroid hormone concentrations .  Few studies investigated effects of   vitamin D  treatment on other clinical health indicators  in early CKD . Rigorous studies are necessary to investigate optimal  vitamin D  dosing strategies in  early CKD  for the maintenance of adequate vitamin D status , management of secondary hyperparathyroidism and improvement of non-skeletal related clinical outcomes."
"FTelemedicine interventions may be associated with reductions in  hospital admission rate and mortality  in  patients with heart failure ( HF ) .  The present study is an up date d analysis ( as of June 30 , 2016 ) of r and omized controlled trials , where  patients with HF  underwent  telemedicine care  or  the usual st and ard care .  Data were extracted from  39 eligible studies for  all-cause and HF-related hospital admission rate , length of stay , and mortality .   The  overall all-cause mortality  ( pooled OR=0.80 , 95 % CI 0.71 to 0.91 , p<0.001 )  , HF-related admission rate  ( pooled OR=0.63 , 95 % CI 0.53 to 0.76 , p<0.001 ) ,  and HF-related length of  stay ( pooled st and ardized difference in means=−0.37 , 95 % CI −0.72 to −0.02 , p=0.041 ) were significantly lower in the  telemedicine group ( teletransmission and telephone-supported care )  , as compared with the  control  group . In subgroup  analysis , all-cause mortality  ( pooled OR=0.69 , 95 % CI 0.56 to 0.86 ,  p=0.001 ) , HF-related admission  rate ( OR=0.61 , 95 % CI 0.42 to 0.88 ,  p=0.008 ) , HF-related length of stay  ( pooled st and ardized difference in means=−0.96 , 95 % CI −1.88 to −0.05 ,  p=0.039 ) and HF-related mortality  ( OR=0.68 , 95 % CI 0.54 to 0.85 , p=0.001 ) were significantly lower in the teletransmission group , as opposed to the st and ard care group ,  whereas only HF-related admission  rate ( OR=0.64 , 95 % CI 0.52 to 0.79 , p<0.001 ) was lower in the telephone-supported care group . Overall , telemedicine was shown to be beneficial , with home-based teletransmission effectively  reducing all-cause mortality and HF-related hospital admission , length of stay and mortality  in patients with HF."
" There is evidence from RCTs to suggest that neither oral anticoagulation with  warfarin  or platelet inhibition with  aspirin  is better for  mortality  in  systolic heart failure  with  sinus rhythm  ( high quality of the evidence for all-cause mortality and moderate quality of the evidence for non-fatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding events ) . Treatment with  warfarin  was associated with a 20 % reduction in  non-fatal cardiovascular events  but a twofold higher risk of  major bleeding complications  ( high quality of the evidence ) . We saw a similar pattern of results for the  warfarin  versus  clopidogrel  comparison ( low quality of the evidence ) . At present , there are no data on the role of oral anticoagulation versus  antiplatelet agents  in heart failure with preserved  ejection fraction  with sinus rhythm . Also , there were no data from RCTs on the utility of  non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants  compared to  antiplatelet agents  in heart failure with sinus rhythm."
"tBACKGROUND We performed a meta- analysis to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of short-term ( ≤6 months ) and long-term ( > 6 months ) , regular ( OaD ) and on-dem and ( PRN )  regimens of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors ( PDE5-Is )  in treating   erectile dysfunction (  ED ) after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy ( NSRP ) .  METHODS We conducted a literature search in  August 2016  . Sources included PubMed , EMBASE , and MEDLINE data bases . The main outcome was  International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function ( IIEF-EF ) domain score  , and the secondary outcome was  treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) .  RESULTS  Eight articles involving 13 r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs )  were used in this analysis : they suggested  that PDE5-Is  can improve  the IIEF-EF  distinctly in comparison with  placebo  in short and long term ( mean difference [ MD ] : 2.26 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.45 - 3.08 , P<0.00001 , and MD : 4.5 , 95 % CI : 3.6 - 5.4 , P<0.00001 ) , and long-term use  of PDE5-Is  ( > 6 months ) can improve  the IIEF-EF  distinctly in comparison with short-term use  of PDE5-Is  ( ≤6 months ) ( MD : 3.9 , 95 % CI : 3.01 - 4.8 , P<0.00001 ) . OaD  of PDE5-Is  significantly  improved the IIEF-EF  compared to placebo in short and long term ( MD : 4.08 , 95 % CI : 3.2 - 4.97 , P<0.00001 , and MD : 4.74 , 95 % CI : 3.79 - 5.69 , P<0.00001 ) . No significant differences were  found in IIEF-EF  changes between PRN and placebo ( ≤6 months ) ( MD : 2.64 , 95 % CI : -0.87 to 6.14 , P=0.14 ) , and between PRN and OaD group ( > 6 months ) ( MD : -0.58 , 95 % CI : -9.86 to 8.74 , P=0.91 ) . There were  more TEAEs   in PDE5-Is  group in comparison with placebo ( odds ratio [ OR ] : 1.55 , 95 % CI : 1.26 - 1.91  , P<0.0001 ) , and TEAEs  in OaD group were not significantly different from those seen in PRN group ( OR : 1.05 , 95 % CI : 0.78 - 1.4 , P=0.77 ) .  Our meta- analysis suggests  that PDE5-Is  are  efficient and safe  for treatment of ED after NSRP , and we should choose the regular regimen for short term and regular or on-dem and regimen for long term . Further high- quality RCTs are needed to vali date this result."
" It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about the use of  topiramate  in clinical practice from this evidence . The only high- quality evidence found was that  lithium  is more  efficacious  than  topiramate  when used as monotherapy in the treatment of acute affective episodes in bipolar disorder , and we note that this evidence came from only two studies . Moderate- quality evidence showed that  topiramate  was no more or less  efficacious  than  placebo  as monotherapy when a 3-week endpoint was used , but the  quality of the evidence  for this outcome at a 12-week endpoint dropped to low . As we grade d the  quality of  the  evidence  for the other findings as low and very low , it was not possible to draw any conclusions from the results .To best address this research question , if investigators see the indication in so doing , more double-blind r and omised controlled trials could be conducted that are more explicit with regard to method ological issues . In particular , investigators could compare  placebo , alternative , and combination treatments ( including a wide range of mood  stabilisers  )  ,  atypical antipsychotics  for manic and mixed episodes , and  antidepressants in combination with mood stabilisers or atypical antipsychotics  for depressive episodes."

"dSTUDY DESIGN Systematic review . OBJECTIVE To identify the definitions of recurrence ( and related recovery definitions ) currently used in the literature . SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Recurrence of  low back pain ( LBP )  is a common and costly problem and the goal of many treatments is to prevent future recurrences . However , it is unclear whether st and ardized recurrence definitions are being used in the research literature evaluating the risk of recurrence and the effectiveness of treatments to prevent recurrence . METHODS A literature search was performed of MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , AMED , and PEDro , and from chosen systematic review s investigating treatments that could plausibly affect recurrence of LBP .  Studies were considered eligible if they investigated  recurrence  of LBP in a cohort of patients with LBP .  Inclusion was assessed by 2 review ers and definitions of recurrence ( and related recovery ) were extracted . RESULTS  Fifty-three studies were identified by the review .  Only 32 % of studies gave explicit definitions of recurrence and only 10 % gave a definition for both  recurrence and recovery .  Less than 10 % of studies shared a common definition of  recurrence .   Because of a lack of an agreed terminology it is very difficult to compare results between studies reporting recurrence rates or evaluating strategies to prevent recurrence . Steps to achieve consensus on recurrence and recovery definitions are required . In the interim , it is recommended that a minimum pain duration of 24 hours with a minimum pain intensity equivalent to the appropriate minimal important change for the chosen scale , be used for defining a recurrence . If  disability measures  are used , it is also recommended that the appropriate minimal important change be used . For recovery , a minimum duration of 1 month pain-free should be used."
"lPurpose To provide evidence -based recommendations to up date the American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline on systemic therapy for  stage IV non – small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .  Methods An Up date Committee of the American Society of Clinical Oncology NSCLC Expert Panel based recommendations on a systematic review of r and omized controlled trials from January 2007 to February 2014 . Results This guideline up date reflects changes in evidence since the previous guideline . Recommendations There is no cure for  patients with stage IV NSCLC .  For  patients with performance status ( PS ) 0 to 1 ( and appropriate patient cases with PS 2 ) and without an EGFR-sensitizing mutation or ALK gene rearrangement  ,  combination cytotoxic chemotherapy  is recommended , guided by histology , with early concurrent palliative care . Recommendations for patients in the first-line setting include  platinum-doublet therapy  for those with PS 0 to 1  ( bevacizumab may be added to carboplatin plus paclitaxel  if no contraindications  ) ; combination or single-agent chemotherapy or palliative care alone  for those with PS 2 ;  afatinib , erlotinib  ,  or gefitinib  for those with sensitizing EGFR mutations ;  crizotinib  for those with ALK or ROS1 gene rearrangement ; and following first-line recommendations or using  platinum plus etoposide  for those with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma . Maintenance therapy  includes pemetrexed continuation  for patients with stable disease or response to  first-line pemetrexed-containing regimens , alternative chemotherapy , or a chemotherapy break .  In the second-line setting , recommendations include  docetaxel , erlotinib , gefitinib , or pemetrexed  for patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma ;  docetaxel , erlotinib , or gefitinib  for those with squamous cell carcinoma ;  and chemotherapy or ceritinib  for those with ALK rearrangement who experience progression after crizotinib . In the third-line setting , for patients who have not received erlotinib or  gefitinib  , treatment with  erlotinib  is recommended . There are insufficient data to recommend routine  third-line cytotoxic therapy .  Decisions regarding systemic therapy should not be made based on age alone .

"   Electronic self-monitoring  of mood in depression  appears to be a valid  measure  of  mood  in contrast to self-monitoring of  mood  in mania . There are yet few studies on the effect of   electronic self-monitoring of mood   in bipolar disorder . The evidence of  electronic self-monitoring  is limited by method ological issues and by a lack of RCTs . Although the idea of  electronic self-monitoring  of  mood  seems appealing , studies using rigorous methodology investigating the beneficial as well as possible harmful effects of  electronic self-monitoring  are needed."
"FBACKGROUND The aim of this position statement was to inform the choice of  physical activity  tools for use within  CF research and clinical setting  s. METHODS A systematic review of  physical activity tools  to explore evidence for  reliability  ,  validity  , and responsiveness . Narrative answers to "" four key questions "" on motion sensors , question naires and diaries were drafted by the core writing team and then discussed at the Exercise Working Group in ECFS Lisbon 2013 . RESULTS AND SUMMARY Our current position is that  activity monitors  such  as SenseWear or ActiGraph  offer informed choices to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of  physical activity  , and should as a minimum report on dimensions of  physical  activity including  energy expenditure , step count and time spent in different intensities and sedentary time .  The  DigiWalker pedometer  offers an informed choice of a comparatively inexpensive method of obtaining some measurement of  physical activity .  The HAES represents an informed choice of question naire to assess physical activity . There is insufficient data to recommend the use of one diary over another . Future research should focus on providing additional evidence of clinimetric properties of these and new physical activity assessment tools , as well as further exploring the added value of physical activity assessment in CF."
" :  Yoghurt  consumption is associated with  lower body mass index , lower body weight/weight gain , smaller waist circumference and lower body fat  in epidemiological studies . RCTs suggest  weight reduction effects  , but do not permit determination of a cause – effect relationship . Well-controlled , adequately powered trials in research and community setting s appear likely to identify a modest but beneficial effect of  yoghurt  consumption for prevention of  weight gain and management of obesity .  The ready availability of  yoghurt  ( a nutrient-dense food ) and its ease of introduction to most diets suggests that educating the public to eat  yoghurt  as part of a balanced and healthy diet may potentially contribute to improved public health . Future carefully design ed RCTs could provide proof of principle and large community-based studies could determine the practical impact of  yoghurt  on body weight/composition."
"gAgeing is associated with reduced  appetite and energy  intakes . However , the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood . This systematic review and meta- analysis quantified differences in circulating concentrations of  appetite-related hormones  between  healthy older and younger adults .  Six data bases were search ed through 12th June 2018 for studies that compared appetite-related hormone concentrations between  older and younger adults .  Data were pooled using r and om-effects meta- analysis and are presented as st and ardised mean difference ( Hedges ’ g ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) .  Thirty-five studies were included involving 710 older adults ( mean ± SD ; age : 73 ± 5 years ) and 713 younger adults ( age : 28 ± 7 years ) .  Compared with younger adults , older adults  exhibited higher fasted and postpr and ial concentrations of the anorectic hormones cholecystokinin  ( Fasted : SMD 0.41 ( 95 % CI 0.24 , 0.57 ) ; p < 0.001 . Postpr and ial : SMD 0.41 ( 0.20 , 0.62 ) ; p <  0.001 ) , leptin  [ Fasted : SMD 1.23 ( 0.15 , 2.30 ) ; p = 0.025 . Postpr and ial : SMD 0.62 ( 0.23 , 1.01 ) ; p = 0.002 ]  and insulin  [ Fasted : SMD 0.24 ( − 0.02 , 0.50 ) ; p = 0.073 . Postpr and ial : SMD 0.16 ( 0.01 , 0.32 ) ;  p  =  0.043 ] . Higher postpr and ial concentrations of peptide-YY  were also observed in older adults compared with younger adults [ SMD 0.31 ( − 0.03 , 0.65 ) ; p = 0.075 ] . Compared with younger adults , older adults  had lower energy  intakes [ SMD − 0.98 ( − 1.74 , − 0.22 ) ; p = 0.011 ]  , and lower hunger  perceptions in the fasted [ SMD − 1.00 ( − 1.54 , − 0.46 ) ; p < 0.001 ] and postpr and ial states [ SMD − 0.31 , ( − 0.64 , 0.02 ) ; p =  0.064 ] . Higher circulating concentrations of insulin , leptin , cholecystokinin  and peptide-YY accord with reduced  appetite and energy intakes  in  healthy older adults .  Interventions to  reduce  circulating levels of these hormones may be beneficial for combatting the anorexia of ageing."
"tPURPOSE OF REVIEW  Fructose  is seen as uniquely contributing to the p and emics of obesity and its cardiometabolic complications . Much of the evidence for this view derives from the unique biochemical , metabolic , and endocrine responses that differentiate  fructose  from  glucose .  To underst and whether these proposed mechanisms result in clinical ly meaningful modification of cardiovascular risk in  humans  , we up date a series of systematic review s and meta-analyses of controlled feeding trials to assess the cardiometabolic effects of  fructose  in  isocaloric replacement for glucose .  RECENT FINDINGS A total of  20 controlled feeding trials ( n = 344 )  have investigated the effect of   fructose  in/on cardiometabolic endpoints   .  Pooled analyses show that although  fructose  may increase  total cholesterol , uric acid , and postpr and ial triglycerides  in isocaloric replacement for glucose , it does not appear to be any worse than glucose in its effects on other aspects of the  lipid profile , insulin , or markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease .  It may also have important advantages over  glucose  for  body weight , glycemic control , and blood pressure .  SUMMARY Depending on the cardiometabolic endpoint in question ,  fructose  has variable effects when replacing  glucose .  In the absence of clear evidence of net harm , there is no justification to replace  fructose  with  glucose  in the diet."

"sA role for  second-generation antipsychotics ( SGAs )  in the treatment of   panic disorders  ( PD )  has been proposed , but the actual usefulness of SGAs in this disorder is unclear . According to the PRISMA guidelines , we undertook an up date d systematic review of all of the studies that have examined , in r and omized controlled trials , the  efficacy and tolerability  of   SGAs   ( as either monotherapy or augmentation ) in the treatment of  PD  , with  or without other comorbid psychiatric disorders . Studies until 31 December 2015 were identified through PubMed ,  PsycINFO  ,  Embase , Cochrane Library and Clinical trials.gov .  Among 210 studies , five were included ( two involving patients with a principal diagnosis of PD and three involving patients with bipolar disorder with comorbid PD or generalized anxiety disorder )  . All were eight-week trials and involved treatments with  quetiapine extended release , risperidone and ziprasidone .  Overall , a  general lack of efficacy of SGAs on panic symptoms  was observed . Some preliminary indications of the  antipanic effectiveness  of risperidone are insufficient to support its use in PD , primarily due to major limitations of the study . However , several method ological limitations may have negatively affected all of these studies , decreasing the validity of the results and making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions . Except for ziprasidone , SGAs were  well tolerated  in these short-term trials."
"aKnee osteoarthritis ( OA ) is a degenerative disease which is expected to become one of the leading causes of disability by the next years . This work aims to assess if  balneotherapy and spa therapy  can significantly improve  Quality of Life ( QoL )  of  patients with knee OA .  Medline via PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , and PEDro were systematic ally search ed for  articles  about  trials involving patients with knee OA  and measuring the effects of  balneotherapy and spa therapy  on study participants ’ QoL with vali date d scales . A qualitative and quantitative syntheses were performed .  Seventeen studies were considered eligible and included in the systematic review .  Fourteen trials reported significant improvements in at least one  QoL item  after treatment . Ten studies were included in quantitative synthesis . When comparing  balneological interventions with st and ard treatment  , results favored the former in terms  of long-term overall QoL  [ ES = − 1.03 ( 95 % CI − 1.66 to − 0.40 ) ] . When comparing  balneological interventions with sham interventions  , results favored the former in  terms of long-term pain improvement  [ ES = − 0.38 ( 95 % CI − 0.74 to − 0.02 ) ] , while no significant difference was found when  considering social function  [ ES = − 0.16 ( 95 % CI − 0.52 to 0.19 ) ] . In conclusion , even though limitations must be considered , evidence shows  that BT and spa therapy  can  significantly improve QoL  of  patients with knee OA .  Moreover  , reduction of drug consumption and improvement of algofunctional indexes  may be other beneficial effects . Further investigation is needed because of limited available data."
"  Adenosine and verapamil  are both effective treatments for supraventricular tachycardia in the majority of patients .

"sThe World Bank , the Gates Foundation and the World Health Organization promote national  child deworming programmes  in  developing countries.1  They assert these programmes will improve  nutritional status , health and school performance  , and hence contribute to  economic growth .  Indeed , the World Health Organization states that deworming contributed to Japan ’s economic boom in the 1950s,2 and Nobel Laureates meeting in Copenhagen ranked  deworming  as the fourth most important intervention to solve the health problems of the whole world.3 Surprisingly , the evidence base for these cl aims from controlled studies is limited . Critically , according to the Cochrane review which two of us author , there is quite good evidence of no  effect  for the main  biomedical outcomes  in  deworming  , making the broader societal benefits on economic development barely credible ( Figure 1).4 Nevertheless , the advocates increasingly rely on a single large quasi-r and omized trial carried out in Kenya , published in 2004 in Econometrica,5 which reports  school attendance .  Figure 1 . Conceptual framework used to underpin the effects of  deworming programmes  on  economic growth   in developing countries .  Contemporary evidence questions this model , as there is now quite good contemporary evidence , summarized in the Cochrane review , that ... This study has been highly influential . The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation commissioned the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM ) to replicate the analysis , as the original analysis is ‘ based on econometric approaches and used a language and format that would be unfamiliar to many health care research ers’.6 The replication aim ed to provide detail of the methods and reporting in line with the CONSORT statement . The team are internationally recognized , independent and meticulous in their approach . They agreed a protocol , carefully checked and corrected the raw data , and then re-ran their prespecified analysis .6 Their first paper is a pure replication,7 exactly repeating the authors ’ original analysis . This paper clarifies some method ological details not provided in the original paper , but it also uncovers a series of important coding and analysis errors . Some of the corrected results are consistent with the original findings , but others are quite different . Most notably , the much quoted  ‘ positive externalities’—where  the benefits of treating children in one school ‘ spill over ’ to benefit children in adjacent schools — vanish in their corrected analysis . Their second paper uses approaches more familiar to epidemiologists , and allows a more thorough exploration of the data .8 There are substantial amounts of missing information , and some unexpected patterns that are difficult to explain . For example , there is a correlation between the number of observations in each school and the reported attendance , with more observations associated with lower attendance reported — except in some of the intervention groups , where more frequent observation is associated with better attendance . This raises the possibility that the process of observation influenced outcome reporting and this was different in control and intervention groups . The second paper confirms an association with  higher attendance  in the  deworming schools  when stratified by year , but found the combined estimate across years was much larger , and the authors caution the validity of the combined year estimate : this may be due to the stepped-wedge design where the combined year estimate includes a before and after comparison ; or it may be due to the problems with secular and group effects of the number of observations of school attendance varying . To further complicate matters , there was also a concurrent  ‘ School Assistance Program ’  ( SAP ) evaluating five other interventions in  27/75 of the study schools  , which was not part of the r and omized intervention .  Attendance patterns  differed on the basis of involvement in the SAP , which the authors suggest could well lead to bias.8 One of the critical points the LSHTM papers make is that the administration of the  deworming drugs  was part of a ‘ complex health  education  and drug treatment intervention’.8 The  intervention  schools also received  regular public health lectures , wall charts and teacher training on worm prevention .  Interestingly , the pure replication shows very similar  impacts of the intervention  on  children  in the intervention schools irrespective of whether they took the deworming medicine or not.7 For Miguel and colleagues , they term this as ‘ indirect within-school effects ’ of deworming , but equally the effects could be due to the non-specific effects of the health promotion interventions in the intervention schools . So where does this take us ? There is a small effect on  school attendance  for sure , but this should not be over-interpreted , as the LSHTM authors say , given the concerns raised regarding the risk of bias , and the independent effects on  school attendance  of the programme of health promotion . In addition , the study shows that allocation to the deworming group does not influence  student progress  , as the re- analysis shows clearly no evidence of a difference in  examination performance  between deworming and control groups.7,8 In the context of the global evidence base , there is only one other study that has examined  school attendance  with no obvious effect shown.4 Given all these uncertainties , we simply do n’t know if there is truly an effect on  school attendance  from the data , in taking all these factors into account formally in a GRADE analysis .4 But what weakens the case of  deworming  still further is that there is now quite good evidence of  no effect  for most of the main outcomes ( Figure 1 ) , including  nutritional status , haemoglobin , cognition and school performance .  This is important because without these effects it seems implausible that deworming itself would have an independent effect on  school attendance or economic development .  Obviously children infected with worms should be treated . Trials from over 20 years ago in an area of  Kenya  where  all the children were heavily  infected showed benefit . Another trial in India showed benefit , but subsequent trials in the same area failed to show an effect.4,9 So deworming may have helped in these exceptional , heavily infected , untreated population s from another decade , but this is scarcely a solid base for contemporary policy : public health nutrition has changed , worm burden has declined and this probably accounts for the lack of effect on biomedical outcomes in contemporary studies .10 We have been perplexed by the un question ing belief behind deworming in the advocates , and have found it is deep rooted in American history . The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission in 1909 sought to eradicate hookworm in the  Southern USA population  , where it was seen as a cause of ‘ some of the proverbial laziness of the poorer classes ’ and to improve  worker productivity ;  these were extended with the Rockefeller International Health Commission established in 1913.11 The beliefs and assumptions appear to continue , with ‘ Deworm the World ’ aim ing to deworm 220 million children in India during 2015.12 What have we learned from this ? Certainly that replication is a valuable process , not least for errors that have the potential to mislead , but also to provide a much better interpretation of the potential biases in studies . In terms of policies in deworming , it suggests donors and Nobel Prize winners need to be aware of their prior assumptions , and base decisions on the all the evidence from reliable studies within a systematic review , not just select a single study . They need to look at all relevant outcomes , not just one . They need to consider bias and confounding . Our view is that current promotion of  community deworming  is certainly a panacea : a single solution to multiple problems in low- and middle-income countries , and that the belief that deworming will impact substantially on economic development seems delusional when you look at the results of reliable controlled trials . This is a view , based on over 15 years of engagement with critically appraising the literature in this field.13 We recommend anyone responsible for public or philanthropic money going to large scale deworming to read these replication studies , the original publication , the authors ’ responses to the replication and the 2015 version of the Cochrane review that includes corrections from these replications plus data from five further studies , including the recently published DEVTA study of 2  million children.4,14  Then make up your own mind . Conflict of interest : PG and DTR are authors  of a Cochrane review of community deworming programmes .  PG is funded by the Department for International Development to provide reliable independent systematic review s for the benefit of developing countries ; PG receives salary support from Countdown , a DFID-supported research grant in programmatic implementation of neglected tropical disease programmes."
" Myofascial trigger points are a prevalent clinical entity , especially in  patients with neck pain .  Evidence was not found to support or deny the role of MTrPs in other spinal pain . Compelling evidence supports local mechanisms underlying MTrPs . Future research should unravel the relevance of central mechanisms and investigate the incidence of MTrPs in patients with spinal pain."
"7To build an underst and ing of the neurobiology underpinning arm recovery in  people with severe arm impairment due to stroke  , we conducted a pooled individual data systematic review to : 1 ) characterize brain biomarkers ; 2 ) determine relationship(s ) between biomarkers and motor outcome ; and 3 ) establish relationship(s ) between biomarkers and motor recovery . Three electronic data bases were search ed up to October 2 , 2015 .  Eligible studies included adults with severe arm impairment after stroke .  Descriptive statistics were calculated to characterize brain biomarkers , and pooling of individual patient data was performed using mixed-effects linear regression to examine relationships between brain biomarkers and motor outcome and recovery .  Thirty-eight articles including individual data from 372 people with severe arm impairment were analysed .  The majority of  individuals  were in  the chronic ( > 6 months ) phase post stroke ( 51 % ) and had a subcortical stroke ( 49 % )  . The  presence of a motor evoked potential  ( indexed by transcranial magnetic stimulation ) was the only biomarker related to better motor outcome ( p = 0.02 ) . There was no relationship  between motor outcome and stroke volume  ( cm3 ) ,  location  ( cortical , subcortical , mixed ) or  side  ( left vs. right ) ,  and corticospinal tract asymmetry index  ( extracted from diffusion weighted imaging ) . Only one study had longitudinal data , thus no data pooling was possible to address change over time ( preventing our third objective ) . Based on the available evidence ,  motor evoked potentials at rest  were the only biomarker that predicted motor outcome in individuals with severe arm impairment following stroke . Given that few biomarkers emerged , this review highlights the need to move beyond currently known biomarkers and identify new indices with sufficient variability and sensitivity to guide recovery models in  individuals with severe motor impairments following stroke  .

" : Some clinical pre caution s should be taken to decrease the release of BPA , namely the use of rubber dam , the immediate polishing of all resins used , or the use of glycerin  gel  to avoid non-polymerization of the last resin layer , and mouthwash after treatment . Another preventive measure in addition to the above-mentioned is the use of the smallest possible number of  restorations or sealants  , a maximum of four per appointment . These measures are even more important in children , adolescents and pregnant women."

">Abstract The relationship between  sugar  consumption and various health-related sequelas is controversial . Some investigators have argued that excessive sugar consumption is associated with increased risk of obesity , coronary heart disease , diabetes ( T2D ) , metabolic syndrome , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , and stimulation of reward pathways in the brain potentially causing excessive caloric consumption . These concerns have influenced organizations such as the World Health Organization , the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition in Engl and not to exceed 5 % of total energy and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans Advisory Committee 2015 to recommend upper limits of sugar consumption not to exceed 10 % of calories . Data from many r and omized control trials ( RCTs ) do not support linkages between sugar consumption at normal levels within the human diet and various adverse  metabolic and health-related effects .   Fructose  and  glucose  are typically consumed together in roughly equal proportions from  high-fructose corn syrup (  also known as  isoglucose in Europe ) or sucrose .  The purpose of this review is to present data from recent RCTs and findings from recent systematic review s and meta-analyses related to sugar consumption and its putative health effects . This review evaluates findings from recent r and omized controlled trials , systematic review s and meta-analyses into the relationship of  sugar  consumption and a range of health-related issues including  energy-regulating hormones , obesity , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and accumulation of liver fat and neurologic responses .  Data from these sources do not support linkages between sugar consumption at normal levels within the human diet and various adverse  metabolic and health-related effects ."
" This review provides some support to the notion that  patients experiencing antipsychotic side-effects  are at risk of developing more negative  attitudes  toward medication . Implication s for practice - Regular attitude assessment s should be conducted for  patients  with  side-effects  , and prompt clinical interventions and patient education can be carried out to manage side-effects . Implication s for research - There is a need for more quantitative studies to further underst and the relationship between the two variables."
"gThis article provides recommendations , developed by the Working Group ( WG ) on Probiotics of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology , and Nutrition , for the use of  probiotics  for the prevention of  antibiotic-associated diarrhea ( AAD ) in children  based on a systematic review of previously completed systematic review s and of r and omized controlled trials published subsequently to these review s. The use of  probiotics  for the treatment of AAD is not covered . The recommendations were formulated only if at least 2 r and omized controlled trials that used a given probiotic ( with strain specification ) were available . The  quality of evidence ( QoE )  was assessed using the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and  Evaluation  guidelines  . If the use of  probiotics  for preventing AAD is considered because of the existence of risk factors such as class of antibiotic(s ) , duration of antibiotic treatment , age , need for hospitalization , comorbidities , or previous episodes of AAD diarrhea , the WG recommends using  Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG  ( moderate QoE , strong recommendation ) or  Saccharomyces boulardii  ( moderate QoE , strong recommendation ) . If the use of probiotics for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is considered , the WG suggests using S boulardii ( low QoE , conditional recommendation ) . Other strains or combinations of strains have been tested , but sufficient evidence is still lacking."
" Informed consent is an important ethical and practical part of patient care . We have identified efforts by research ers to investigate interventions which seek to improve information delivery and consideration of information to  enhance   informed consent  . The interventions used consistently improve  patient knowledge  , an important prerequisite for informed consent . This is encouraging and these measures could be widely employed although we are not able to say with confidence which types of interventions are preferable . Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the high levels of heterogeneity associated with many of the main analyses although we believe there is broad evidence of beneficial outcomes for patients with the pragmatic application of interventions . Only one study attempted to measure   informed consent   as a unified concept."
"sAdiponectin secreted from adipose tissue is proposed to be inversely related to the body fat mass . However , the magnitude of the effect of low calorie diet on  adiponectin concentrations  remains unknown . The present study was aim ed to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis on clinical trials that access the effect of low calorie diet on  adiponectin concentration  . We search ed PubMed , SCOPUS , ISI web of science , and Google scholar for RCTs until January 2015 . Totally ,  13 trials were found  , which examined the effect of low calorie diet on  adiponectin concentration  compared control group without low calorie diet . Our meta- analysis showed that weight loss diet can substantially  increase the adiponectin concentration  in overall ( Hedges ' g=0.34 , 95 % CI:0.17 - 0.50 , p<0.001 ) . Subgroup analysis also revealed that the low calorie diet can substantially  enhance adiponectin concentrations  when prescribed for ≤16 weeks ( Hedges ' g=0.48 , 95 % CI : 0.12 - 0.83 , p=0.01 ) compared to > 16 weeks ( Hedges ' g=0.30 , 95 % CI : 0.11 - 0.48 , p=0.002 ) . Weight loss diet  beneficially affects blood adiponectin concentrations  . More clinical trials are recommended to clear this effect among different genders and nationalities , and assess the magnitude of the effect based on changes in fat mass."
"yPurpose of review  Gabapentinoids  are frequently used in the management of   cancer pain .   In recent Cochrane systematic review s , although there was an abundance of evidence relating to non-cancer pain , only a few studies related to  cancer pain .  This review summarizes recent r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the use of  gabapentinoids  for  tumour-related ( as monotherapy or part of combination therapy ) and treatment-related pain .  Recent findings For  tumour-related pain  , ten out of  thirteen studies  showed  statistically significant benefits  in favour of  gabapentinoids .  When used , as part of monotherapy or combination therapy ,  benefits  were observed in five out of six studies evaluating  gabapentin  , and in six out of eight studies evaluating  pregabalin .  For treatment-related  pain  , none of the four studies ( two  gabapentin  , two  pregabalin )  showed  statistically significant benefits  in favour of  gabapentinoids .  Unfortunately , many of the studies included were limited by small sample size , lack of blinding , and inadequate follow-up . Summary More and better quality studies are required , although it may be challenging to accomplish in this patient population .  Gabapentinoids  may offer  benefits  to  cancer patients with pain  , but careful titration and monitoring of adverse effects is necessary."
"dThe aim of this systematic review was to analyze the results of observational and interventional research / studies on  nutrition-based practice s  in the prevention of  hypertension among healthy youth .  The MEDLINE / PubMed data base was search ed using the key words , "" hypertension , "" "" nutrition/diet , "" "" prevention   ""   and   ""  youth  . ""  Inclusion criteria were : 1 ) sample with a majority of adolescents , defined as 10 - 24 years of age , or findings for adolescents reported separately from other age groups ; 2 ) primary research reports ; 3 ) studies with normotensive participants ; and 4 ) studies that  focused on preventing  hypertension/lowering blood pressure  through at least one nutritional practice . Results of the analysis indicated that increased  consumption of unsaturated fats , fruits  ,  vegetables and  low-fat dietary products   ,  decreased consumption of dietary sodium and beverages containing caffeine  ,  and breastfeeding  were found to have preventive  effects  against  high blood pressure  in later years of life .

 This systematic review and meta- analysis failed to detect a significantly different  secondary caries rate  of subgingivally located prosthetic margins in the short to mid-term ( 10 years ) . Due to the small number and the limitations of the included studies the results do not provide conclusive evidence as to the effect of prosthetic margin placement on the incidence of secondary caries.
"eABSTRACT In this systematic review , we discuss the scientific evidence about the effect of dietary  intake of seeds and sesame derivatives  on  lipid  profile  and  blood pressure ( BP )  of hypertensive and dyslipidemic individuals .  Clinical trials published in  English , Portuguese or Spanish  were search ed on the following data bases : Lilacs , PubMed , Isi Web of Knowledge , Cochrane Library , Scopus , Trip Data Base and Scielo . The bibliographic search period was started in September 2013 and ended in January 2014 . The biases of risk analysis were carried out considering 6 of the 8 criteria of the Cochrane H and book for Systematic Review s of Interventions Version 5.1 . Of the  7 clinical trials included  ,  five evaluating individuals with  hypertension   observed a significant reduction in  systolic and /or diastolic blood pressure .  The two articles that evaluated  individuals with  dyslipidemia showed improvement in  lipid profile .  The mechanisms of action are still being studied . Regarding the bias risk analysis , clinical trials included showed few descriptions of the methods applied . There are few studies about  sesame  ingestion , and it was observed high risk for bias in the selected studies . More st and ardized methods with attention to the design of studies are needed to improve the level of the evidence."

"nObjectives : Various studies have research ed the  serum levels of leptin , adiponectin and resistin  in  patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS )  , but the results were inconclusive . The purpose of this study was to systematic ally evaluate the correlations between serum levels of these adipokines and AS . Methods : Electronic data bases were retrieved to search relevant publications . Pooled st and ard mean difference ( SMD ) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by the r and om‐effect model . Cochrane Q test and I2 statistic were used to test heterogeneity . Subgroup analysis and meta‐regression were applied to assess possible sources of heterogeneity . Results :  A total of sixteen articles were included .  Meta‐ analysis results indicated no statistical differences between  AS patients and normal  controls  in serum leptin and adiponectin levels  ( leptin , SMD = 0.829 , 95 % CI = − 0.116 to 1.774 , p = 0.085 ; adiponectin , SMD = 0.460 , 95 % CI = − 0.004 to 0.924 , p = 0.052 ) . However ,  AS patients  had  higher serum resistin levels  than controls ( SMD = 1.413 , 95 % CI = 0.294 to 2.531 , p = 0.013 ) . Subgroup analyses suggested that  Asian and African AS patients as well as patients aged < 40 years  had  higher serum leptin and resistin levels  when compared to  controls . Serum adiponectin levels  were higher in AS patients compared to controls in subgroup of age ≥ 40 ,  and  serum resistin levels in subgroup of BMI ≥ 25 . Measurement method was a source of heterogeneity for resistin . Publication bias was not observed and the robustness of study results was confirmed by sensitivity analysis . Conclusion  : Serum resistin ,  but  not leptin or adiponectin levels  may be closely associated with the development of AS . HighlightsSerum levels of resistin are associated with the pathogenesis of AS.In specific subgroups , leptin and adiponectin may be related to AS.Measuring type is one of sources of heterogeneity for the studies about resistin."
" This review provides low quality evidence that in  patients with mild to moderate hypertension  ,  dual receptor blockers  lowered  trough BP  by an average of -6/-4 mm Hg and reduced  heart rate  by five beats per minute . Due to the larger sample size from the two unpublished studies ,  carvedilol  provided a better estimate of  BP lowering effect  than  labetalol .  The  BP lowering  estimate from combining  carvedilol  once and twice the starting doses is -4/-3 mm Hg . Doses higher than the recommended starting dose did not provide additional  BP reduction .  Higher doses of  dual receptor blockers  caused more  bradycardia  than lower doses . Based on indirect comparison with other classes of drugs , the  blood pressure lowering  effect of dual alpha- and beta-receptor blockers is less than non-selective , beta1 selective and partial agonist beta blockers , as well as thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system .  Dual blockers  also had little or no effect on reducing  pulse pressure  , which is similar to the other beta-blocker classes , but less than the average reduction of  pulse pressure  seen with thiazides and drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system .  Patients taking  dual receptor blockers   were not more likely to  withdraw  from the study compared to  patients  taking placebo."
"dPurpose The American Society of Breast Surgeons ( ASBrS ) sought to provide an evidence -based guideline on the use of  neoadjuvant systemic therapy ( NST )  in the management of  clinical stage II and III invasive breast cancer .  Methods A comprehensive non systematic review was performed of selected peer- review ed literature published since 2000 . The Education Committee of the ASBrS convened to develop guideline recommendations . Results A performance and practice guideline was prepared to outline the baseline assessment and perioperative management of  patients with clinical stage II – III breast cancer under consideration for  NST .   Recommendations Preoperative  or NST  is emerging as an important initial strategy for the management of  invasive breast cancer  . From the surgeon ’s perspective , the primary goal of  NST  is to increase the  resectability of locally advanced breast cancer ,  increase  the feasibility of breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy  , and  decrease surgical morbidity .  To ensure optimal patient selection and efficient patient care , the guideline recommends : ( 1 )  baseline breast and axillary imaging ; ( 2 ) minimally invasive biopsies  of breast and  axillary lesions  ; ( 3 ) determination of  tumor biomarkers  ; ( 4 ) systemic staging ; ( 5 ) care coordination , including referrals to medical oncology , radiation oncology , plastic surgery , social work , and genetic counseling , if indicated ; ( 6 )  initiation  of  NST ;  ( 7 )  post-NST   breast and  axillary imaging  ;  and ( 8) decision for surgery based on  extent  of  disease at presentation , patient choice , clinical response to  NST   , and  genetic  testing  results  , if performed."
"sThis systematic review and meta- analysis aims to systematic ally review the fatty acid ( FA ) composition of  breast milk in different population s.  We systematic ally search ed the Medline via PubMed , Scopus and Clarivate till July 2019 .  We initially retrieved 433 articles .  Having removed duplicates , with initial search ing of title and abstract s ,  317 papers were excluded  and  80 remained .  A meta- analysis of  80 cross-sectional , cohort studies , including 8793 subjects ,  was conducted . Meta-regression analysis indicated that factors including maternal age ( p-values of SFA : 0.03 , omega-3 : 0.01 , trans fats:<0.001 , total fatty acids : 0.02 ) , year of conducting study ( p-values of SFA : < 0.001 , MUFA : 0.02 , omega-6 : 0.04,trans fats : 0.04 ) and sample size ( p-values of SFA : 0.03 , PUFA : 0.01 , omega-6 : 0.01 , omega-3:<0.001 ) contributed to the heterogeneity of meta- analysis . This study indicates the large variation of FA content in maternal  milk  across  different population s.  Special concern is necessary for both the quality and total amount of fat intake of pregnant and lactating mothers."

"nThere is growing literature suggesting a link between  Vitamin D  deficiency  and asthma in children  , but systematic review s are lacking . The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of   Vitamin D  deficiency in asthmatic children  and to assess the correlations of  Vitamin D  levels with asthma incidence , asthma control , and lung functions . PubMed , EMBASE , and Cochrane Library were search ed for observational studies on asthma and  Vitamin D.  Two authors independently extracted data . Meta- analysis was performed using the Review Manager Software .  A total of 23 ( 11 case-control , 5 cohort , and 7 cross-sectional ) studies enrolling 13,160 participants were included in the review .  Overall , Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were prevalent in 28.5 % and 26.7 % children with asthma , respectively . The  mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25(OH)D ) levels  ( 10 studies ) were significantly lower in  asthmatic children  as compared to nonasthmatic  children  with a mean difference of -9.41 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -16.57 , -2.25 ) . The  odds ratio of  Vitamin D  deficiency  ( eight case-control studies ) was significantly higher among  asthmatic children  as compared to nonasthmatic children ( odds ratio 3.41 ; 95 % CI 2.04 , 5.69 ) . Correlations between  Vitamin D levels and incidence of asthma , lung functions , and control of asthma  had mixed results . To conclude ,  asthmatic children  had  lower 25(OH)D levels  as compared to nonasthmatic children , but the  correlations  between  25(OH)D and asthma incidence , asthma control , and lung functions  were varied . Well- design ed r and omized controlled trials are required to determine if  children  with asthma can benefit from Vitamin D supplementation."
"EWe attempted to evaluate whether  circumcision  has an effect on   premature ejaculation .   We search ed three data bases : PubMed , EMBASE and Google scholar on 1 May 2016 for  eligible studies that referred to male sexual function after  circumcision .   No language restrictions were imposed . The Cochrane Collaboration 's RevMan 5.2 software was employed for data analysis , and the fixed or the r and om-effect model was selected depending on the heterogeneity .  Twelve studies were included in the meta- analysis , containing a total of 10019  circumcised  and 11570  uncircumcised  men .  All studies were divided into five subgroups by types of study design to evaluate the effect of  circumcision  on  premature ejaculation ( PE ) . Intravaginal ejaculation latency time ( IELT ) , difficulty of orgasm , erectile dysfunction ( ED ) and pain during intercourse  were also assessed because PE was usually discussed along with these subjects . There were no significant differences  in PE  ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 0.90 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.72 - 1.13 ; p = .37 ) and  orgasm  ( OR , 1.04 ; 95 % CI , 0.89 - 1.21 ; p = .65 ) between circumcised and uncircumcised group . However  , IELT  ( OR , 0.72 ; 95 % CI , 0.60 - 0.83 ;  p < .00001 ) , ED  ( OR , 0.42;95 % CI , 0.22 - 0.78 ; p =  .40 ) and pain during intercourse  ( OR , 0.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.17 - 0.76 ; p = .007 ) favoured circumcised group . Based on these findings ,  circumcision  does not have effect on PE."
"sThe aim of this systematic review was to summarise evidence on the effects  of  job rotation  on musculoskeletal complaints  , exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints and sustainable working life parameters .  A total of 16 studies were included .  No studies on sustainable working life parameters were found . The quality of the studies was assessed using a checklist ; eight field studies and three laboratory studies of sufficient quality were used to summarise the following evidence : one field study showed positive results and one field study showed negative results for  musculoskeletal complaints  , two field studies showed positive results and two field studies showed inconsistent results for exposures , and two field studies showed inconsistent results for  musculoskeletal complaints and exposures .  Two laboratory studies showed inconsistent results and one laboratory study showed no changes for exposures . In conclusion , there is currently inconsistent evidence for positive or negative effects of  job rotation  on  musculoskeletal complaints and exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints .  Practitioner 's Summary : Currently , there is inconsistent evidence for recommending  job rotation  as a strategy for preventing  musculoskeletal complaints .  Exposures from all involved work activities and body regions should be identified and assessed first , to determine if  job rotation  provides increased exposure variation and /or beneficial changes in mean exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints."
"cPatients  with coronary artery disease  are usually treated with  dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) after percutaneous coronary intervention .  Patients on  DAPT  are at risk of both  ischaemic and bleeding events .  Although side-lined for a long time , real-life studies have shown that both the incidence and the associated morbidity and mortality of  out-of-hospital bleeding  are high . This indicates that prevention of ( post-interventional ) bleeding is as important as prevention of ischaemia . For this purpose it is crucial to reliably identify  patients with a high bleeding risk .  In order to postulate an algorithm , which could help identifying these patients , we performed a systematic review to determine the value of previously proposed prognostic modalities for  bleeding .  We search ed and appraised the following tools :  platelet function tests  ,  genetic tests  ,  bleeding scores  and question naires and haemostatic tests . Most studies indicated that low on-treatment  platelet reactivity  (  LTPR )  , as measured by several platelet function tests , and the carriage of CYP2C19 * 17 allele were independent risk factors for bleeding . A  bleeding score  also proved to be helpful in identifying  patients at  risk  .  No studies on  haemostatic tests  were retrieved . Several patient characteristics were also identified as independent predictors of  bleeding  , such as older age , female sex and renal failure . Combining these risk factors we propose an algorithm that would hypothetically facilitate identification of those patients at highest risk , warranting prevention measures for bleeding . This could be a starting point for further research concerning the topic."
" The failure of  vitamin C supplementation  to reduce the incidence of  colds  in the  normal population  indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use . But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments . Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits  on duration and severity  for those using regular  vitamin C  prophylaxis indicates that  vitamin C  plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms . The trials in which  vitamin C  was introduced at the onset of colds as therapy did not show any benefit in doses up to 4 grams daily , but one large trial reported equivocal benefit from an 8 gram therapeutic dose at onset of symptoms."
"mOBJECTIVE To review the published information on  physical training  for  fibromyalgia ( FM ) and related syndromes .  METHODS A search of Medline literature ( via Ovid and PubMed ) with the following keywords : FM , chronic fatigue syndrome ,  therapy , rehabilitation , aerobic , exercise , and cognitive behavioral therapy .  The reference lists of articles were examined for additional related articles . RESULTS Several studies investigated the benefits of  grade d exercise therapy  for  patients with FM or related syndromes .  Although some systematic review s have not established an unequivocal benefit of physical training , most authors report a benefit for  patients with chronic pain or fatigue .  Ideally , such a therapy should be a part of multidisciplinary program . Muscular rehabilitation is reserved for preventing the  deconditioning syndrome  often reported in patients and the vicious cycle of  pain , avoidance and inactivity behaviors  , or  even kinesiophobia , deconditioning , incapacity and psychological distress .   This review emphasizes the relevance of  grade d physical training  for treating FM and related syndromes . The development of rehabilitation centers , with experts able to propose a relevant therapy to  patients with chronic  pain  or fatigue  , should help alleviate this public health problem."

For non-oral HT , decreases in  lipoprotein(a ) , cell adhesion molecules , and factor VII  generally were significant ,  resistance to activated protein C ( APCr )  was slightly increased , and other markers including  CRP and homocysteine  did not change . Compared with oral  HT  , changes  in CRP and APCr  were smaller ,  changes in cell adhesion molecules and some fibrinolytic parameters  tended to be smaller , whereas changes in other factors including  lipoprotein(a ) and homocysteine  did not differ .  ( S ) Potentially unfavorable changes seen with oral  HT  on two important markers ,  CRP and APCr  , are substantially smaller with  non-oral HT . Non-oral HT  has minor effects on the other cardiovascular risk markers studied . Therefore , compared with  oral HT  ,  non-oral HT  appears be safer with respect to atherosclerotic and venous thromboembolic disease risk."
"sThere are current trials investigating the effect of  resveratrol supplementation  on  lipid profiles and liver enzymes  among  patients with metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) and related disorders ;  however , their findings are controversial . This systematic review and meta- analysis were aim ed to determine the effects of  resveratrol supplementation  on  lipid profiles and liver enzymes  among  patients with MetS and related disorders .  We performed a comprehensive search of the following online data bases up to November 2018 : Cochrane Library , PubMed , Embase , and Web of Science . The relevant articles were assessed for quality of studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool .  Out of 2459 citations , 31 articles were appropriate for including  to the current meta-  analysis  . The pooled results indicated  that resveratrol  use significantly  decreased total cholesterol  [ weighted mean difference ( WMD ) = − 7.65 mg/dL ; 95 % CI , − 12.93 , − 2.37 ; P < 0.01 ; I2 : 83.4 % ]  and increased gamma-glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) concentrations  ( WMD = 1.76 U/l ; 95 % CI , 0.58 , 2.94 ; P < 0.01 ; I2 : 20.1 % ) . We found no significant  effect of resveratrol supplementation   on triglycerides  ( WMD = − 5.84 mg/dL ; 95 % CI , − 12.68 , 1.00 ; P = 0.09 ; I2 : 66.8  % ) , LDL-  ( WMD = -2.90 mg/dL ; 95 % CI , − 10.88 , 5.09 ; P = 0.47 ; I2 : 96.0  % ) , HDL-cholesterol  ( WMD = 0.49 mg/dL ; 95 % CI , − 0.80 , 1.78 ; P = 0.45 ; I2 :  74.0 % ) , alanine aminotransferase (  ALT ) ( WMD = -0.14 U/l ; 95 % CI , − 3.69 , 3.41 ; P = 0.93 ; I2 : 79.6  % ) , and aspartate aminotransferase (  AST ) ( WMD = -0.34 U/l ; 95 % CI , − 2.94 , 2.27 ; P = 0.80 ; I2 : 88.0 % ) concentrations . This meta- analysis  demonstrated that  resveratrol supplementation  among patients with MetS and related disorders   significantly reduced total cholesterol and increased GGT concentrations  , but did  not affect triglycerides , LDL- , HDL-cholesterol , ALT , and AST concentrations  . This data suggests  that resveratrol  may have a potential cardio-protective effect in patients with MetS and related disorders."
"OBackground The 20–70 % participation of  diabetes patients  in   lifestyle  interventions  ( LSI )   worldwide seems to be rather sub-optimal , in spite of all intents of such interventions to delay further progress of the disease .  Positive effects  through  LSI  are expected in particular for  patients who suffer less from diabetes-related limitations or other chronic diseases .  Seeing that diabetes prevalence and with it mortality are increasing , LSI have become an inherent part of diabetes treatment st and ards . Various qualitative studies have been carried out to identify participation barriers for LSI . However , these have not result ed in more detailed knowledge about the relative importance of factors with an inhibiting impact on participation . Since it can not be assumed that all of the influencing factors have equivalent values , it is necessary to investigate their individual importance with regard to a positive or negative decision about participating . There are no systematic review s on patient preferences for  LSI  programs in diabetes prevention . As a result , the main objectives of this systematic review are to ( i ) identify existing patient preference elicitation studies related to   LSI  for diabetic patients  , ( ii ) summarize the methods applied and findings , and ( iii ) appraise the reporting and method ological quality of such studies . Methods We will perform systematic literature search es to identify  suitable studies from 14 electronic data bases . Retrieved study records  will be included based on predefined eligibility criteria as defined in this protocol . We will run abstract and full-text screenings and then extract data from all selected studies by filling in a predefined data extraction spreadsheet . We will undertake a descriptive , narrative synthesis of findings to address the study objectives , since no pooling for quantified preferences is for method ological reasons implementable . We will pay special attention to aspects of  method  ological  quality of preference elicitation  by applying established evaluation criteria of the ISPOR and some own developed criteria for different elicitation techniques . All critical stages within the screening , data extraction , and synthesis processes will be conducted by two pairs of authors . This protocol adheres to PRISMA and PRISMA -P st and ards . Discussion The proposed systematic review will provide an overview of the methods used and current practice in the elicitation and quantification of   patients  ’ preferences  for diabetes prevention lifestyle interventions . Furthermore , the method ological quality of the identified studies will be appraised as well . Systematic review registration PROSPERO."
"tOBJECTIVE To assess patient response rates to  medical therapies  used to treat  endometriosis-associated pain .  DESIGN A systematic review with the use of Medline and Embase . SETTING Not applicable . PATIENT(S )  Women receiving  medical therapy  to treat endometriosis .  INTERVENTIONS ( S ) None . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S ) The  proportions  of  patients  who : experienced no  reduction  in  endometriosis-associated pain symptoms  ; had  pain symptoms  remaining at the end of the treatment period ; had  pain recurrence  after treatment cessation ; experienced an  increase or no change in disease score  during the study ; were  satisfied  with  treatment  ; and discontinued therapy owing to  adverse events  or  lack of efficacy .  The change in  pain symptom severity  experienced during and after treatment , as measured on the visual analog scale , was also assessed . RESULT ( S ) In total ,  58 articles describing 125 treatment arms  met the inclusion criteria . Data for the response  of endometriosis-associated pain symptoms  to treatment were presented in only 29 articles . The median proportions of women with  no reduction in pain  were 11%-19 % ; at the end of treatment , 5%-59 % had  pain remaining  ; and after follow-up , 17%-34 % had experienced  recurrence of pain symptoms  after treatment cessation . After median study duration s of 2 - 24 months , the median  discontinuation rates  due  to adverse events or lack of efficacy  were 5%-16 % .  ( S ) Few studies of medical therapies for endometriosis report outcomes that are relevant to patients , and many women gain only limited or intermittent benefit from treatment."

"sSedentary behavior has negative  health outcomes  , evident even in  young children .  Identifying the prevalence of sedentary  behavior in children < 2years  is important for determining the necessity for intervention strategies . The aim of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence of  sedentary behavior in children < 2years .  Medline , PsycINFO , SPORTD iscus , and Education Research Complete electronic data bases were search ed , as were reference lists of included articles and the authors ' own collection s.  Inclusion criteria were : published in a peer- review ed English language journal ; mean age of children < 2years ; and a reported measure of the prevalence of sedentary behavior . Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria .  Most studies used   parent-reported screen time   as the sedentary behavior measure ; only one study reported  time spent restrained  ( i.e. ,  kept inactive  ) and no studies reported objective ly assessed  sedentary time .  Estimates of  young children 's   screen time  ranged from 36.6 to 330.9min/day . The proportion of  children  meeting the zero  screen time  recommendation ranged from 2.3 % to 83.0 % . In conclusion , very little is known about  sedentary behaviors  other than  screen time  in this age group . Although highly variable , findings suggest that  children  are already engaging in high  levels of screen time  by age 2 and the majority exceed current recommendations."

"eBACKGROUND The impact of   active school transport ( AST )   on daily  physical activity ( PA ) levels , body composition  and  cardiovascular fitness  remains unclear . METHODS A systematic review was conducted to examine differences in  PA , body composition and cardiovascular fitness  between  active and passive travelers .  The Medline , PubMed , Embase , PsycInfo , and ProQuest data bases were search ed and  10 key informants  were consulted . Quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE and with the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool for quantitative studies . RESULTS  Sixty-eight different studies met the inclusion criteria  . The majority of studies found that active school travelers were more  active  or that  AST  interventions lead to  increases in PA  , and the quality of evidence is moderate . There is conflicting , and therefore very low quality evidence , regarding the associations between   AST  and body composition indicators  , and between walking to/from school and cardiovascular fitness ; however , all studies with relevant measures found a positive association between  cycling to/from school and cardiovascular fitness ;  this evidence is of moderate quality .  These findings suggest that  AST  should be promoted to increase  PA levels  in  children and adolescents  and that cycling to/ from school is associated with increased  cardiovascular fitness  . Intervention studies are needed to increase the quality of evidence."
"tOsteoporosis is affecting over 200 million people worldwide . Despite available guidelines , care for these patients remains sub-optimal . We developed an  osteoporosis tool  to address the multiple dimensions of chronic disease management . Findings from its evaluation showed a significant increase from baseline in osteoporosis investigations and treatment , so we are revising this tool to include multiple chronic conditions including an up date of evidence about osteoporosis . Our objectives were to conduct a systematic review of  osteoporosis interventions  in  adults at risk for osteoporosis .  We search ed bibliometric data bases for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) in any language evaluating osteoporosis disease management interventions in  adults at risk for osteoporosis .  Review er pairs independently screened citations and full-text articles , extracted data , and assessed risk of bias . Analysis included r and om effects meta- analysis . Primary outcomes were  osteoporosis investigations and treatment , and fragility fractures .   Fifty-five RCTs and one companion report were included in the analysis representing 165,703 patients .  Our findings from 55 RCTs and 18 sub-group meta-analyses showed that  complex implementation interventions  with multiple components consisting of at least  education + feedback  +  follow-up  significantly increased the  initiation of osteoporosis medications  , and interventions with at least education + follow-up significantly increased the  initiation of osteoporosis investigations .  No significant impact was found for any type of intervention to  reduce fracture .  Complex  interventions  that include at least  education + follow-up or feedback  have the most potential for increasing osteoporosis investigations and treatment .  Patient education  appears to be an important component in osteoporosis disease management."

"rBackground Eating disorders are understood to no longer be the remit of lean adolescent girls alone [ 1 ] , whatever pop culture offerings such as  Netflix ’s  To The Bone might continue to present . Rather , people  with eating disorders  are much more diverse , often undiagnosed and often suffering in silence . One  patient population  with a unique but poorly understood  vulnerability to eating disorders ,  as  well as obesity and poor physical health  , is  people with bipolar disorder .  Bipolar disorder is a complex , serious mental illness that confers significant functional impairment , primarily due to time spent in manic , depressed , or mixed state episodes , difficulty eliminating subthreshold depressive symptoms , and the financial , social and emotional sequelae of illness episodes . One significant contributor to  disability  is  physical ill health  , with the average life expectancy of someone with bipolar disorder notably reduced due to cardiometabolic illnesses like heart disease and type two diabetes mellitus . Furthermore , poorer physical health is associated with poorer mental health in this group , such as higher risk of depressive relapse [ 2 , 3 ] . The past two decades has seen increased focus on preserving and  improving the physical health  of  people with bipolar disorder  , who are often prescribed long-term medication known to be conducive to weight gain [ 4 ] . Trials of a number of interventions have attempted to implement  lifestyle interventions  to promote  healthy eating , physical activity  , and  social connectedness  , in order to prevent or reduce  the adverse impact of obesity and improve physical health and psycho-social functioning  [ 5 ] . These have been of limited long-term effectiveness , though early intervention post-first episode psychosis appears to be more promising [ 6 ] . The role of disordered eating in contributing to  physical and mental health outcomes  among individuals with bipolar disorder has rarely been considered , despite the fact that approximately one in three people with  bipolar disorder  also meet criteria for binge eating disorder , bulimia nervosa , or variants of these disorders [ 7 , 8 ] . Alongside studies question ing the  impact of medication on weight gain  in bipolar disorder [ 9 ] , identifying the  role of weight-cycling  in  higher  cardiovascular risk [ 10 ] , and showing that  obesity risk  pre- date s medication [ 11 ] , are reports of a link between  eating disorders and high Body Mass Index  (  BMI  , kg/m ) [ 12 ] and evidence that  baseline binge eating predicts medication-associated weight gain  [ 13 ] . With these recent developments in mind , the authors were curious about what novel interventions for eating disorders and weight disorder in bipolar disorder exist , and conducted a systematic review about their effectiveness . In this search no treatments targeting eating disorders specifically were found to exist [ 14 ] , despite the movement of this area into the spotlight over 10 years ago [ 15 ] . Most treatments of  people with  a high BMI  in bipolar disorder  neglect  psychological factors  with the exception of [ 16 ] , and  people with bipolar disorder  are often though not always ; see [ 17 ] excluded from eating disorder treatment trials e.g. [ 18 , 19 ] . Hence , the  effectiveness  of  Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT )  or."

"dBACKGROUND  Verbal augmented feedback ( VAF )  is commonly used in physiotherapy rehabilitation of  individuals with lower extremity musculoskeletal dysfunction  or to induce motor learning for injury prevention . Its effectiveness for acquisition  , retention  and  transfer of learning  of new skills in this population is unknown . OBJECTIVES First , to investigate the effect of  VAF  for rehabilitation and prevention of lower extremity musculoskeletal dysfunction . Second , to determine its effect on  motor learning  and the stages of acquisition , retention and transfer in this population . DESIGN Systematic review design ed in accordance with the Centre for Review s and Dissemination and reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- analysis . METHOD MEDLINE , Embase , PubMed and  five additional data bases  were search ed to identify primary studies with a focus on  VAF  for prevention and rehabilitation of lower extremity musculoskeletal dysfunction . One review er screened the titles and abstract s. Two review ers retrieved full text articles for final inclusion . The first review er extracted data , whereas the second review er audited . Two review ers independently assessed risk of bias and quality of evidence using Cochrane Collaboration 's tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation , respectively . RESULTS  Six studies were included , with a total sample of 304 participants . Participants included patients with lateral ankle sprain ( n=76 ) , postoperative ACL reconstruction ( n=16 ) and healthy individuals in injury prevention ( n=212 ) .  All six studies included  acquisition  , whereas  retention  was found in five studies . Only one study examined  transfer of the achieved motor learning  ( n=36 ) .  VAF  was found to be effective for  improving lower extremity biomechanics and postural control  with moderate evidence from five studies .   VAF  should be considered in the rehabilitation of lower extremity musculoskeletal dysfunctions . However , it can not be unequivocally confirmed that  VAF  is effective in this population , owing to study heterogeneity and a lack of high- quality evidence . Nevertheless , positive effects on  lower extremity biomechanics and postural control  have been identified . This suggests that further research into this topic is warranted where an investigation of long-term effects of interventions is required . All stages ( acquisition , retention and transfer ) should be evaluated."

"yINTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Many studies have reported putative factors for the development of   chronic  pain after surgery .  However , advances in knowledge about the etiology and prognosis of   chronic postsurgical pain ( CPSP )   could be gained by improving methodology within studies of surgical pain . The purpose of this study was to review predictive factors and to propose core risk factor and outcome domains for inclusion in future epidemiological studies investigating CPSP . METHODS Using the Initiative on Methods , Measurement , and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials as a framework we review ed  risk factor  and  outcome domains  , method ological issues and st and ardized  measurement tools  based on findings from narrative and systematic review s , primary clinical and epidemiological studies and published guidelines for chronic pain clinical trials . RESULTS Five "" core "" risk factor domains ( demographic , pain , clinical , surgery-related , and psychological ) and 4 outcome domains  ( pain , physical functioning , psychological functioning , and global ratings of outcome )  were identified . Important method ological issues , related to the definition and timing of follow-up to assess transition from acute to chronic pain are discussed . We also propose the use of vali date d , st and ardized measurement tools to capture risk factor and outcome domains at multiple time points . DISCUSSION There is potential to advance the field of CPSP research by striving for consensus among pain experts ; this would advance current evidence by improving our ability to compare findings from different studies and would facilitate the aggregation of surgical cohort data sets to allow international comparisons . We propose these findings as a starting point to build a comprehensive framework for epidemiological studies investigating chronic pain after surgery."
"tFast  track  is a st and ardised goal directed patient 's care pathway that aims to facilitate recovery following surgery . Currently , there are large variations in the  fast track protocol  s used in oesophagectomy due to the complexity of the procedure . The objective of this systematic review is to assess the evolution of  fast track protocol s   following  oesophagectomy   since its implementation and the result ing effect on postoperative outcomes . Relevant electronic data bases were search ed for studies assessing the clinical outcome from  fast track in oesophagectomy  and also those assessing the effects of the individual key components in fast track protocol s. The search yielded  twenty-three publications  regarding  fast  track  implementation in oesophagectomy .  A pattern of consistent evolution in fast-track protocol s was clearly demonstrated and these have shown variations in the core-identified components across the studies . However , evolution in fast track protocol s over time showed , an overall improvement in  length of stay , anastomotic leak , pulmonary complications and mortality over  time . Thirty publications were included that evaluated specific components of fast track protocol s , with an increasing trend towards addressing the nutritional aspect in oesophagectomy care in more recent years . The variations in the key components of  fast track protocol  of care identify the need for continued assessment and identification for areas of improvement . In the future incremental gains through focused improvements in key components will lend itself to even better postoperative outcomes and patient experience during oesophageal cancer treatment."
"MAbstract The aim of the study is to compare  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) surgery  versus  medical treatment  for   type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM )  in obese patients .Bariatric   surgery  can achieve remission of T2DM in  obese patients .   RYGB surgery  has been performed as one of the most common surgical treatment options for  obese  patients with T2DM , but the efficacy of  RYGB surgery  comparing with medical treatment alone has not been conclusively determined . A systematic literature search identified r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating  RYGB surgery  versus  medical treatment  for   T2DM  in obese patients  was conducted in PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Data base , and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry . This systematic review and meta- analysis were performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review s and meta-analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines . The primary outcome was  T2DM remission .  Additional analyses comprised  hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference , serum lipid level , blood pressure , medication use , and adverse events .  R and om-effects meta-analyses were calculated and presented as weighted odds ratio ( OR ) or mean difference ( MD ) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI).Six  RCTs concerning 410 total obese T2DM patients were included  . Follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 months .  RYGB surgery  was associated with a  higher T2DM remission rate  ( OR : 76.37 , 95 % CI : 20.70–281.73 , P < 0.001 )  and serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( MD : 0.24 mmol/L , 95 % CI 0.18–0.30 mmol/L , P < 0.001 ) than medical treatment  alone .  HbA1c ( MD : –1.25 % , 95 % CI : –1.88 % to –0.63 % , P <  0.001 ) ,  BMI ( MD : –6.54 kg/m2 , 95 % CI : –9.28 to –3.80 kg/m2 , P < 0.001 ) ,  waist  circumference ( MD : –15.60 cm , 95 % CI : –18.21 to –13.00 cm , P <  0.001 ) ,  triglyceride ( MD : –0.87 mmol/L , 95 % CI : –1.17 to –0.57 mmol/L , P < 0.001 ) , low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol  ( MD : –0.32 mmol/L , 95 % CI : –0.62 to –0.02 mmol/L , P =  0.04 ) , systolic blood pressure  ( MD : –2.83 mm Hg , 95 % CI : –4.88 to –0.78 mm Hg , P < 0.01 ) were lower after  RYGB  surgery .  However , FPG  ( MD : –1.58 mmol/L , 95 % CI : –3.58 to 0.41 mmol/L ,  P  =  0.12 ) , total cholesterol  ( MD : –0.40 mmol/L , 95 % CI : –0.92 to 0.12 mmol/L , P = 0.13  ) , and diastolic blood pressure  ( MD : 0.28 mm Hg , 95 % CI : –1.89 to 2.45 mm Hg , P = 0.80 ) were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups .  The medicine use and quality of life  were solely improved in the surgical group  . Nutritional deficiencies and anemia  were noted more frequently in the RYGB group .  RYGB surgery  is superior to medical treatment  for short- to medium-term remission of T2DM , improvement of metabolic condition , and cardiovascular risk factors  . Further RCTs should address  the  safety and long-term benefits of  RYGB surgery  on obese patients with T2DM."

" Our review suggests that  physical activity interventions  have a moderate effect on  self reported physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness  , but not on achieving a predetermined level of physical activity . Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies , only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions . Future studies should provide greater detail of the components of interventions."
"8Background With approximately 8 hours of one ’s waking day spent at work , occupational tasks and environments are important influencers on an individual ’s physical activity ( PA ) and sedentary behaviours . Little research has compared device-measured  physical activity , sedentary behaviour and cardiometabolic outcomes  between  occupational groups .  Objective To compare device-measured movement (  sedentary time [ ST ]  , light  intensity   physical  activity [ LPA ] , moderate-to-vigorous intensity  physical  activity [ MVPA ] , and steps ) across occupations . The secondary objective was to examine whether  cardiometabolic and fitness outcomes  differed by occupation . Methods Five bibliographic data bases were search ed to identify  all studies which included working age , employed adults from high-income countries , and reported on device-measured movement within occupations .  Risk of bias within and across studies was assessed . Results were synthesized using meta-analyses and narrative syntheses . Results The review includes  132 unique studies with data from 15,619 participants . Working adults  spent ~ 60 % of their working and waking time engaged in  sedentary behaviour ;  a very small proportion ( ~ 4 % ) of the day included MVPA . On average , workers accumulated 8124  steps/day .  Office and call center  workers ’ steps/day  were among the lowest , while those of postal delivery workers were highest . Office workers had the  greatest ST  and the  lowest time in LPA  both at work and during wakeful time . However , office workers had the  greatest minutes sent in MVPA  during wakeful hours . Laborers had the  lowest ST  and spent a significantly greater proportion of their work time  in LPA and MVPA  . Healthcare and protective services workers had  higher levels of LPA  at work compared to other occupations . Workers in driving-based occupations tended to have a  higher body mass index and blood pressure  . Conclusion This review identifies that occupational and wakeful time PA and ST differed between occupations . Future studies are needed to assess whether patterns differ by age and sex , describe leisure-time movement and movement patterns , and the relationship with cardiometabolic health .

"sThe present study investigated whether the outcome of r and omized clinical trials study ing  fluoxetine  favored  fluoxetine  , where this was the experimental agent , and favored comparator antidepressants in trials where  fluoxetine  was the reference agent . A systematic review of all  double-blind , r and omized clinical trials  comparing  fluoxetine  with any  other antidepressant  drug  in patients suffering from depression  was carried out .  Thirty-seven studies meeting the inclusion criteria were analyzed .  A metaregression analysis indicated that , after adjusting for possible confounders , studies where  fluoxetine  was the experimental agent were positively associated with  treatment effect  , indicating a significant advantage for  fluoxetine  . The evidence that the  outcome of  fluoxetine  trials  varied according to whether this drug was used as a new compound or a reference one suggests the presence of bias."
":Obesity has become a medical and socioeconomic burden of epidemic proportions and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has marked obesity as one of the most blatantly visible but most neglected public health problems . Indeed , being overweight is an established risk factor for the development of many different diseases including cardiovascular , metabolic , and orthopaedic illnesses . In contrast , obesity has not been associated with a worse outcome in all patient population s. In fact , substantial data have accumulated suggesting a survival benefit in  patients with existing chronic cardiovascular diseases for patients who are overweight  and moderately  obese .  In chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , convincing evidence has accumulated from studies including  > 30 000 patients over a broad spectrum of disease severity  , that being overweight is associated with decreased  mortality.1–4  Similarly , in  patients with acutely decompensated heart failure  , higher body mass index ( BMI ) is associated with  lower in-hospital mortality.5  Despite the known role of obesity as a major risk factor for cardiovascular events,6–8  the mortality risk after an acute myocardial infa rct  ion is no higher in overweight and obese patients compared with lighter patients .9 In a systematic review of  40 studies including a total of > 250 000 patients with coronary artery disease  , a better  outcome for cardiovascular and total mortality  was seen in the overweight and mildly obese groups … * Corresponding author .

"sA systematic review of the literature on clinical outcomes following   direct anterior approach ( DAA ) hip arthroplasty   was performed . An aggregated  11,810 hip procedures were analyzed  for intraoperative and early postoperative complications . The most common complication following  DAA hip arthroplasty  was  nerve dysfunction  ( 2.8 % ) followed by  intraoperative fractures  ( 2.3 % ) .  Postoperative dislocation , wound complications , and revision THA within the first 12 months  were reported in 1.2 % of cases . Thus , while  DAA hip arthroplasty  can be successfully performed , it is not without complications . Without definitive evidence of clinical superiority , surgeons considering switching to  DAA  should benchmark their personal complication rates against published reports."
" Overall , there are sparse data informing the use of antihypertensive agents in  children  , with outcomes reported limited to  blood pressure  and not end organ damage . The most data are available for c and esartan , for which there is low- quality evidence of a modest lowering effect on  blood pressure .  We did not find evidence of a consistent dose response relationship for escalating doses of  angiotensin receptor blockers , calcium channel blockers  or  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors .  All agents appear safe , at least in the short term."

"dR and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) have observed contrasting results on the effects of  vitamin C  on  circulating biomarkers of glycaemic and insulin regulation .  We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of RCTs testing the effect of  vitamin C  administration on  glucose , HbA1c and insulin concentrations .  Four data bases ( PubMed , Embase , Scopus and Cochrane Library ) were used to retrieve RCTs  published  from  inception until April 2016 and testing the effects of  vitamin C  in adult participants .  The  screening of 2008 articles yielded 22 eligible studies ( 937 participants ) .  Overall ,  vitamin C  did  not modify glucose , HbA1c and insulin concentrations .  However , subgroup analyses showed  that vitamin C   significantly reduced glucose concentrations  ( −0.44 mmol/l , 95 % CI : −0.81 , −0.07 , P=0.01 ) in  patients with type 2 diabetes  and in interventions with a duration greater than 30 days ( −0.53 % , 95 % CI : −0.79 , −0.10 , P=0.02  ) . Vitamin C  administration had greater  effects on fasting  ( −13.63 pmol/l , 95 % CI : −22.73 , −4.54 , P<0.01 ) compared  to  postpr and ial insulin concentration . Meta-regression analyses showed that age was a modifier of  the effect  of vitamin C  on insulin concentration  . Furthermore , the effect size was associated  with baseline BMI and plasma glucose levels  , and with the duration of the intervention . In conclusion ,  greater reduction in glucose concentrations  observed in  patients with diabetes , older individuals  and with more prolonged supplementation . Personalised interventions with  vitamin C  may represent a feasible future strategy to enhance benefits and efficacy of interventions . Nevertheless , results need to be interpreted cautiously due to limitations in the primary studies analysed."
" The current evidence , from cross-sectional and prospect i ve cohort studies , supports that  physical activity  of any bout duration is associated  with improved health outcomes  , which  includes all-cause mortality  . This may suggest the need for a contemporary paradigm shift in public health recommendations for physical activity , which supports  total MVPA  as an important lifestyle behavior regardless of the bout duration."

"eAbstract Background Beta‐blockers refer to a mixed group of drugs with diverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties . They have shown long‐term  beneficial effects on mortality and cardiovascular disease ( CVD )  when used in  people with heart failure or acute myocardial infa rct ion .  Beta‐blockers were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first‐line therapy for hypertension . However , the benefit of beta‐blockers as first‐line therapy for hypertension without compelling indications is controversial . This review is an up date of a Cochrane Review initially published in 2007 and up date d in 2012 . Objectives To assess the effects of beta‐blockers on  morbidity and mortality endpoints  in  adults with hypertension .  Search methods The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist search ed the following data bases for r and omized controlled trials up to June 2016 : the Cochrane  Hypertension  Specialised Register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ( 2016 , Issue 6 ) , MEDLINE ( from 1946 ) , Embase ( from 1974 ) , and Clinical Trials.gov . We checked reference lists of relevant review s , and reference lists of studies potentially eligible for inclusion in this review , and also search ed the the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 06 July 2015 . Selection criteria R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of at least one year of duration , which assessed the effects of  beta‐blockers  compared to  placebo  or  other drugs  , as first‐line therapy for hypertension , on   mortality  and morbidity   in adults  . Data collection and analysis We selected studies and extracted data in duplicate , resolving discrepancies by consensus . We expressed study results as risk ratios ( RR ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) and conducted fixed‐effect or r and om‐effects meta‐analyses , as appropriate . We also used  GRADE  to assess  the certainty of the evidence . GRADE  classifies the  certainty of  evidence as high ( if we are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of effect ) , moderate ( if the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect ) , low ( if the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect ) , and very low ( if we are very uncertain about the estimate of effect ) . Main results  Thirteen RCTs met inclusion criteria .  They compared beta‐blockers  to placebo  ( 4  RCTs , 23,613 participants  ) , diuretics (  5 RCTs , 18,241 participants  ) ,  calcium‐channel  blockers ( CCBs : 4  RCTs  ,  44,825 participants  ) , and renin‐angiotensin system ( RAS ) inhibitors ( 3 RCTs , 10,828  participants ) .  These RCTs were conducted between the 1970s and 2000s and most of them had a high risk of bias result ing from limitations in study design , conduct , and data analysis . There were  40,245 participants taking  beta‐blockers  , three‐quarters of them taking  atenolol .   We found no outcome trials involving the newer  vasodilating beta‐blockers  ( e.g.  nebivolol )  . There was no difference  in all‐cause mortality  between  beta‐blockers and placebo  ( RR 0.99 , 95 % CI 0.88 to 1.11 ) ,  diuretics or RAS inhibitors  , but it was higher for beta‐blockers compared to CCBs ( RR 1.07 , 95 % CI 1.00 to 1.14 ) . The evidence  on mortality  was of moderate‐certainty for all  comparisons . Total CVD  was lower for beta‐blockers compared to placebo ( RR 0.88 , 95 % CI 0.79 to 0.97 ; low‐certainty evidence ) , a reflection of the  decrease in stroke  ( RR 0.80 , 95 % CI 0.66 to 0.96 ; low‐certainty evidence ) since there was no  difference in coronary heart disease  ( CHD : RR 0.93 , 95 % CI 0.81 to 1.07 ; moderate‐certainty evidence ) .  The effect  of  beta‐blockers on CVD  was worse than that of CCBs ( RR 1.18 , 95 % CI 1.08 to 1.29 ; moderate‐certainty evidence ) , but was not different from that of diuretics ( moderate‐certainty ) or RAS inhibitors ( low‐certainty ) . In addition , there was an  increase in  stroke in beta‐blockers compared to CCBs ( RR 1.24 , 95 % CI 1.11 to 1.40 ; moderate‐certainty evidence ) and RAS inhibitors ( RR 1.30 , 95 % CI 1.11 to 1.53 ; moderate‐certainty evidence ) . However , there was little or no  difference in CHD  between beta‐blockers and diuretics ( low‐certainty evidence ) , CCBs ( moderate‐certainty evidence ) or RAS inhibitors ( low‐certainty evidence ) . In the single trial involving  participants aged 65 years and older   ,  atenolol was associated  with an increased CHD  incidence compared to diuretics ( RR 1.63 , 95 % CI 1.15 to 2.32 ) . Participants taking beta‐blockers were more likely to  discontinue treatment due to adverse events  than participants taking RAS inhibitors ( RR 1.41 , 95 % CI 1.29 to 1.54 ; moderate‐certainty evidence ) , but there was little or no difference with placebo , diuretics or CCBs ( low‐certainty evidence ) . Authors ' conclusions Most outcome RCTs on beta‐blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias .   Atenolol   was the beta‐blocker most used . Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta‐blockers leads to  modest CVD reductions  and little or no  effects on mortality  . These beta‐blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs . Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta‐blockers or whether beta‐blockers have differential effects on  younger and older  people."

"eINTRODUCTION A range of outcome measures across various domains are used to evaluate change following an intervention in clinical trials  on chronic neuropathic pain ( NeP ) .  However , to capture a real change in the variable of interest , the psychometric properties of a particular measure should demonstrate appropriate method ological quality . Various outcome measures in the domains of pain and physical functioning have been used in the literature for NeP , for which individual properties ( eg , reliability/validity ) have been reported . To date , there is no definitive synthesis of evidence on the psychometric properties of those outcome measures ; thus , the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the method ological quality [ COnsensus-based St and ards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments ( COSMIN ) guidelines ] of studies that evaluated psychometric properties of pain and physical functioning outcome measures used for NeP. METHODS Specific MeSH/keywords related to 3 areas ( pain and /or physical functioning , psychometric properties , and NeP ) were used to retrieve relevant studies ( English language ) in key electronic data bases ( MEDLINE ( Ovid ) , CINAHL ( EBSCO ) , Scopus , AMED , and Web of Science ) from data base inception-July 2012 . Articles retrieval/screening and quality analysis ( COSMIN ) were carried out by 2 independent review ers . RESULTS  Twenty-four pain and thirty-seven  physical functioning outcome measures   were identified , varying in method ological quality from poor-excellent .  Although a variety of pain  and  physical  functioning outcome  measures have been reported in the literature , few have demonstrate method ologically strong psychometric properties . Thus , future research is required to further investigate the psychometric properties of existing pain and physical functioning outcome measures used for clinical and research purpose."
"sAIM To evaluate the impact of an  aerobic fitness program  on  disease activity  , defined by the  Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI )  and on  C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index ( BASFI )  in case of axial spondyloarthritis . METHODS A systematic review of the literature , following the Prisma recommendations , was performed by two review ers on the PubMed and Embase data bases . Controlled trials assessing the efficacy of  aerobic exercises  compared to  physiotherapy  on axial spondyloarthritis disease activity were included . The  diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis was meeting the New York criteria and /or the Assessment in Axial Spondyloarthritis International Working Group criteria .   Aerobic fitness  was defined as an exercise performed at 50%-90 % of the maximal heart rate or between 50 % and 80 % oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) peak . RESULTS  Five hundred and twenty abstract s were identified  and  93  abstract s were analyzed .  Eight studies  met the selection criteria and 6 were finally included in this study because of the presence of a control group . Both groups were similar in terms of age , sex ratio , disease duration .  Aerobic exercise  provided a positive impact on  the BASDAI  in the  intervention group ( 148  patients  )  ( weighted mean difference [ WMD ] : -0.52 [ 95 % CI : -0.9 to -0.13 ] ) ( I2 : 10.3 % , P = 0.35 ) . However , when compared to a control group (  152  patients ) , the improvement of  BASDAI  did n't reach significance ( WMD : -0.25 [ 95 % CI : -0.83 to 0.32 ] ) ( I2 : 0 % , P = 0.41 )  . Aerobic exercise  did not  improve BASFI , CRP or ESR .    Aerobic exercise  did not provide beneficial  effects  either on  disease activity  or on  physical function and biological parameters  when compared to a control group in axial spondyloarthritis."

"OBackground Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia of the heart with a prevalence of approximately 2 % in the western world . Atrial flutter , another arrhythmia , occurs less often with an incidence of approximately 200,000 new patients per year in the USA .  Patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter  have an increased  risk of death and morbidities .  The management of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is often based on interventions aim ing at either a  rhythm control strategy  or a  rate control strategy .  The evidence on the comparable effects of these strategies is unclear . This protocol for a systematic review aims at identifying the best overall treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter . Methods This protocol for a systematic review was performed following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and the eight-step assessment procedure suggested by Jakobsen and colleagues . We plan to include all relevant r and omised clinical trials assessing the effects of any rhythm control strategy versus any rate control strategy . We plan to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , LILACS , Science Citation Index Exp and ed on Web of Science , and BIOSIS to identify relevant trials . Any eligible trial will be assessed and classified as either high risk of bias or low risk of bias , and our conclusions will be based on trials with low risk of bias . The analyses of the extracted data will be performed using Review Manager 5 and Trial Sequential Analysis . For both our primary and secondary outcomes , we will create a ‘  Summary of Findings  ’ table and use  GRADE assessment  to assess the quality of the evidence . Discussion The results of this systematic review have the potential to benefit thous and s  of patients  worldwide as well as healthcare systems and healthcare economy .

"eBACKGROUND  Remote monitoring ( RM ) strategies  have the potential to deliver specialised care and management to  patients with heart failure ( HF ) .  OBJECTIVE To determine the  clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness  of  home telemonitoring ( TM ) or structured telephone support ( STS ) strategies  compared with  usual care  for  adult patients who have been recently discharged ( within 28 days ) from acute care after a recent exacerbation of HF .  DATA SOURCES  Fourteen electronic data bases ( including MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsycINFO and The Cochrane Library ) and research registers were search  ed  to January 2012  , supplemented by h and - search ing relevant articles and contact with experts . The review included r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) or observational cohort studies with a contemporaneous control group that included the following RM interventions : ( 1 )  TM ( including cardiovascular implanted monitoring devices )  with medical support provided during office hours or 24/7 ; ( 2 )  STS programmes delivered by human-to-human contact ( HH ) or human-to-machine interface ( HM ) .  REVIEW METHODS A systematic review and network meta- analysis ( where appropriate ) of the clinical evidence was carried out using st and ard methods . A Markov model was developed to evaluate the  cost-effectiveness  of different  RM  packages compared with  usual  care for recently discharged HF patients . TM 24/7 or using cardiovascular monitoring devices was not considered in the economic model because of the lack of data and /or unsuitability for the UK setting . Given the heterogeneity in the components of usual  care  and  RM  interventions , the cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a set of costing scenarios design ed to reflect the different configurations of  usual care and RM  in the UK . RESULTS The literature search es identified  3060 citations .  Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were added to the 15 trials identified from the previous systematic review s giving a total of 21 RCTs included in the systematic review . No trials of cardiovascular implanted monitoring devices or observational studies met the inclusion criteria . The  method ological quality  of the studies varied widely and reporting was generally poor . Compared with  usual care , RM  was  beneficial  in  reducing all-cause mortality  for STS HH [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.77 , 95 % credible interval ( CrI ) 0.55 to 1.08 ] , TM  during office hours  ( HR 0.76 , 95 % CrI 0.49 to 1.18 ) and TM 24/7 ( HR 0.49 , 95 % CrI 0.20 to 1.18 ) ; however , these results were statistically inconclusive . The results for TM 24/7 should be treated with caution because of the poor method ological quality of the only included study in this network . No favourable effect  on mortality  was observed with STS HM . Similar reductions were observed  in all-cause hospitalisations  for  TM  interventions , whereas STS interventions had no major effect . A sensitivity analysis , in which a study was excluded because it provided better-than-usual support to the control group , showed larger beneficial effects for most outcomes , particularly for TM during office hours . In the  cost-effectiveness analyses  ,  TM  during office hours was the most  cost-effective  strategy with an estimated  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER )  of £ 11,873 per quality -adjusted life-year ( QALY ) compared with usual care , whereas STS HH had an ICER of £ 228,035 per QALY compared with TM during office hours . STS HM was dominated by usual care . Similar results were observed in scenario analyses performed using higher costs of usual care , higher costs of STS HH and lower costs of TM during office hours . LIMITATIONS The  RM interventions  included in the review were heterogeneous in terms of monitored parameters and HF selection criteria and lacked detail in the components of the RM care packages and usual care ( e.g. communication protocol s , routine staff visits and re sources used ) . As a result , the economic model developed scenarios for different RM classifications and their  costs  were estimated using bottom-up costing methods . Although the users can decide which of these scenarios is most representative of their setting , uncertainties still remain about the assumptions made in the estimation of these costs . In addition , the model assumed that the effectiveness of the interventions was constant over time , irrespective of the duration of deployment , and that the intervention was equally effective in different age/severity groups .  Despite wide variation in usual care and RM strategies , cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that TM during office hours was an optimal strategy ( in most costing scenarios ) . However , clarity was lacking among descriptions of the components of RM packages and usual care and there was a lack of robust estimation of costs . Further research is needed in these areas .

"sAdhesion is a significant concern after  surgery .  Many research ers studied the anti-adhesive effect of  statin  , of which results were inconsistent . Thus , we purpose d to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the effect of  statins  on postoperative adhesion in an experimental study . A comprehensive search was conducted using MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Google Scholar to identify  animal studies  that investigated the  postoperative anti-adhesive effect  of   statins   applied at the surgical area . Primary outcome measure was  gross adhesion score .  Secondary outcomes included  microscopic adhesion score and tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) activity .   Totally , 298 rats from 9 animal studies ( 172 rats received  statin therapy  and 126 rats received  placebo or no treatment )  were included in the final analysis .  The combined results showed that  gross and microscopic adhesion scores  were significantly lower in the  statin  group in comparison to the control group ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] = 1.65 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.02 to 2.28 , Pchi2 < 0.001 , I2 = 77.9 % ; SMD = 1.90 , 95 % CI : 1.10 to 2.79 , Pchi2 < 0.001 , I2 = 84.5 % , respectively ) . However , there was no evidence of a  difference in t-PA activity  ( SMD = −3.43 , 95 % CI : −7.95 to 1.09 , Pchi2 < 0.001 , I2 = 95.5 % ) . In conclusion ,  statins  were effective in preventing  postoperative  adhesion , as assessed based on gross and microscopic adhesion scores in rats."
"eStudies reported that  Serenoa repens  was effective in  relieving  lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS )  .  This article carried out a systematic review and meta- analysis to compare  Serenoa repens with tamsulosin  in the treatment of   benign  prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) after at least 6-month treatment cycle . Four studies involving 1,080 patients ( 543 in the  Serenoa repens  group and 537 in the  tamsulosin  group )  were included in the meta- analysis . The results were as follows : compared with  tamsulosin , Serenoa repens  had a same effect in treating BPH in terms  of International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS )  ( mean difference [ MD ] 0.63 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] [ −0.33 , 1.59 ] , p =  0.20 ) , quality of life ( QoL )  ( MD 1.51 , 95 % CI [ −1.51 , 4.52 ] , p =  0.33 ) , maximum flow rate ( Qmax )  ( MD 0.27 , 95 % CI [ −0.15 , 0.68 ] , p =  0.21 ) , postvoid residual volume ( PVR )  ( MD −4.23 , 95 % CI [ −22.97 , 14.44 ] , p =  0.65 ) , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA  ) ( MD 0.46 , 95 % CI [ −0.06 , 0.97 ] , p =  0.08  ) with the  exception of prostate volume  (  PV )  ( MD −0.29 , 95 % CI [ −0.41 , −0.17 ] ,  p < 0.00001 )  .  For side effects  , Serenoa repens was  well tolerated  compared with  tamsulosin  especially  in ejaculation disorders  ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 12.56 , 95 % CI [ 3.83 , 41.18 ] ,  p < 0.0001 ) and decreased libido  ( OR = 5.40 ; 95 % CI [ 1.17 , 24.87 ] ; p = 0.03 ) . This study indicated that Serenoa repens had the same effect in treating BPH compared  with tamsulosin  in terms  of IPSS , QoL , and PVR  after at least 6-month treatment cycle , however , the latter had a greater improvement  in  PV compared with the former .  And  Serenoa repens did not increase the  risk of adverse events  especially with  respect to ejaculation disorders and libido  decrease."

"eBackground A growing number of studies and review s have documented the impact of  telemedicine  on  diabetes management .  However , no meta- analysis has assessed whether including  nutritional counseling  as part of a  telemedicine program  has a significant impact on  diabetes outcomes  or what kind of  nutritional counseling  is most effective . Methods Original research articles examining the effect of  telemedicine interventions  on  HbA1c levels  in  patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes  were included in this study . A literature search was performed and  92 studies were retained for analysis .  We examined stratified results by differentiating interventions using  no nutritional counseling  from those that used  nutritional counseling .  We further compared between  nutritional counseling administered via short message systems ( SMS ) such as email and text messages , and nutritional counseling administered via telephone or videoconference .  Results Telemedicine programs that include a nutritional component show similar effect in  diabetes management  as those programs that do not . Furthermore , subgroup analysis reveals that nutritional  intervention  via SMS such as email and text messages is at least as equally effective in reducing  HbA1c  when compared to  personal nutritional counseling  with a practitioner over videoconference or telephone . Conclusion The inclusion of  nutritional counseling  as part of a telemedicine program does not make a significant difference to  diabetes outcomes .  Incorporating  nutritional counseling  into telemedicine programs via SMS is at least as effective as  counseling  via  telephone  or videoconference."
"aBackground Many  preschoolers  spend a substantial portion of their day enrolled in centre-based childcare ; the amounts of physical activity and sedentary time accumulated in this environment are critical to  preschoolers  ’ ability to meet movement guidelines . The purpose of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the objective ly assessed  physical  activity   and   sedentary time   of  preschoolers in centre-based childcare  ( registration no. CRD42016033502 ) . Methods  Eight online data bases  were search ed using terms related to physical activity , sedentary time ,  preschoolers  and centre-based childcare . Published , peer- review ed primary studies written in English that objective ly assessed  ( via accelerometry )  the  physical activity  and sedentary time  of preschoolers ( 2 - 5 years ) in centre-based childcare  were included . Results  Fifty-five studies ( published 2004 - 2017 ) from 11 countries , representing 13,956 participants were included .  Studies reported  light physical activity  ( n=38 ) ranging from 2.94 to 29.96 mins/hr ,  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity  ( n=46 ) which ranged from 1.29 to 22.66 mins/hr , and  total physical activity  ( n=42 ) ranging from 4.23 to 47.17 mins/hr  . Sedentary time  ( n=47 ) ranged from 12.38 to 55.77 mins/hr . Conclusion  Physical activity and sedentary time  were highly varied and inconsistent between studies ; therefore , it is difficult to determine  preschoolers  ’ true amount of  physical activity  and  sedentary time  during childcare hours . Despite this variability ,  preschoolers  were noted to participate in high rates of  sedentary time  in this setting . The lack of homogeneity is an important finding in and of itself as it highlights the lack of consistency in measuring , processing , and reporting paediatric physical activity data."
",Abstract de la Motte , SJ , Gribbin , TC , Lisman , P , Murphy , K , and Deuster , PA . A systematic review of the association between physical fitness and musculoskeletal injury risk : part 2—muscular endurance and muscular strength . J Strength Cond Res 31(11 ) : 3218–3234 , 2017—This is a systematic review and evaluation of the current evidence on the association between both  muscular endurance  ( ME )  and muscular strength  ( MS ) and musculoskeletal injury ( MSK-I ) risk in  military and civilian population s.  MEDLINE , EBSCO , EMBASE , and the Defense Technical Information Center were search ed for original studies published from  1970  through  2015  which examined associations between  physical  fitness ( ME and MS )  and MSK-I in military or civilian population s.  Method ological quality and strength of the evidence were determined following criteria adapted from previously published systematic review s.  Forty-five of 4,229 citations met  our  inclusion criteria  . Although results for some tests did vary by sex , taken together , our primary findings indicate there is ( a ) a strong evidence that poor  performance  in a  push-up test  is associated with MSK-I risk ; ( b ) moderate evidence that poor  performance  in  sit-up test  is associated with MSK-I risk ; ( c ) moderate evidence that  isokinetic ankle and knee flexion strength , and isometric strength assessment s  at the  back  ,  elbow  , or  knee  are associated with MSK-I risk ; and ( d ) limited evidence that poor performance in a pull-up test and isotonic assessment s of muscular strength are associated with MSK-I. Several measures of ME/MS are moderately or strongly associated with risk  of MSK-I  , but additional research is needed to identify and recommend specific assessment s of ME/MS that predict MSK-I in both men and women . Future studies should also consider measures of  ME and MS  as a function of upper body , lower body , and core strength , and their potential association with specific , rather than general ,."

"  Diuretics  are preferred first-line over  CCBs  to optimize  reduction of cardiovascular events .  The review does not distinguish between  CCBs , ACE inhibitors  or  ARBs  , but does provide evidence supporting the use of  CCBs  over  beta-blockers .  Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions . More well- design ed RCTs study ing the  mortality and morbidity  of  patients taking  CCBs   as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension , different ages , and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes."

" While there is some evidence that ToM , or a precursor skill , can be taught to  people with  ASD , there is little evidence of maintenance of that skill , generalisation to other setting s , or developmental effects on related skills . Furthermore , inconsistency in findings and measurement means that evidence has been grade d of ' very low ' or ' low ' quality and we can not be confident that suggestions of positive effects will be sustained as high- quality evidence accumulates . Further longitudinal design s and larger sample s are needed to help eluci date both the efficacy of  ToM-linked interventions  and the explanatory value of the  ToM  model itself . It is possible that the continuing refinement of the  ToM  model will lead to better interventions which have a greater impact on development than those investigated to date."
" The  sideline assessment  of sport-related concussion is challenging given the elusiveness and variability of presentation , reliance on athlete-reported symptoms , and the varying specificity and sensitivity values of sideline assessment tools . In addition , the recognition of injury and assessment often occur in a time-pressured environment , requiring rapid disposition and decision making . Clinicians should begin the evaluation by assessing for  cervical spine injury , intracranial bleeding , and other injuries  that can present in a similar fashion or in addition to concussion . The  sideline concussion  evaluation should consist of a symptom assessment and a neurologic examination that addresses  cognition ( briefly )  ,  cranial nerve function , and balance .  Emerging tools that assess visual tracking may provide additional information . The  sensitivity  and  specificity  of commonly implemented sideline assessment tools are generally good to very good , especially for  symptom scores and cognitive evaluations  performed within 48 hours of injury , and they are improved when a baseline evaluation is available for comparison . Serial assessment s are often necessary as objective signs and symptoms may be delayed . A st and ardized assessment is paramount in evaluating the  athlete  with a suspected concussion , but there is no replacement for being familiar with the athlete and using clinical judgment when the athlete seems "" not right "" despite a "" normal "" sideline assessment . Ultimately , the clinician should err on the side of caution when making a return-to-play decision."

"nChildren  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD )  are educated in classrooms along with typically developing children . Those with ADHD , however , find it difficult to participate in routine educational and recreational activities as they encounter problems associated with behaviour , attention , motor skills and physical endurance . Traditionally , the management of  children with ADHD  has focussed primarily on problems with cognition and has been heavily dependent on pharmaceutical interventions and , to a lesser extent , on non-pharmaceutical measures . More recently , experts have increasingly advocated the use of  exercises  in alleviating symptoms associated with ADHD . The primary objective of this review was to summarize research that examined the role of  exercises  on deficits related to attention  ,  motor  skills  and fitness in  children with ADHD .  A search of the available literature was conducted using a combination of relevant key words in the following data bases : PubMed , MEDLINE , Google Scholar , Embase and Cochrane review . The search filtered  3016 studies of potential relevance , of which 2087 were excluded after screening titles and abstract  s as per the inclusion criteria .  Thirty-four ( 34 ) studies were analysed  in greater depth ,  and 16 were excluded after detailed consideration as they did not match the inclusion ( PEDro score > 4 ) and exclusion criteria .  Three  ( 3 )  additional studies were excluded as they lacked exercise prescription details such as intensity , duration and frequency of exercise . Finally , 15  studies  were analysed with a focus on the effects of   physical exercises   on  attention , hyperactive behaviour , motor skills and physical fitness  in ADHD children . Overall , the studies review ed were of moderate-to-high quality and reported benefits of a variety of  exercise programmes  in improving  motor skills , physical fitness , attention and social behaviour  in children with ADHD . However , there was limited information regarding school-based programmes , the effects of  structured exercise programmes  independently or in  combination with cognitive-based therapies  , and the long-term benefits of  exercises  in alleviating  behavioural problems  in these children."
"n[ Purpose ] The present literature review was conducted on the use of different measures for the evaluation of  balance  in  patients with Parkinson 's disease .  [ Material s and Methods ] The PubMed  , Bireme , SciELO , Lilacs  , and  PEDro  electronic data bases were search ed for relevant studies . [ Results ] The search es initially led to the retrieval of  3,623 articles , 540 of which were potentially eligible after limiting the search to clinical trials  published  in the last five years  . A total of  264 duplicates  were removed , and  276 articles were excluded  based on their titles and abstract s. The full texts of 84 articles were analyzed , and only those with a PEDro score higher than four points ( n=25 ) were included in the review . [ Conclusion ] Different methods , such as scales , tests , and equipment , are used for the evaluation of  balance  in  patients with Parkinson 's disease .  More than one measure has been employed in most studies , and there is no consensus on a single precise measure for the evaluation of  balance  in this population."
"gThe use of  dual-task training paradigm  to enhance  postural stability  in  patients with balance impairments  is an emerging area of interest . The differential effects of  dual tasks  and  dual-task training  on  postural stability  still remain unclear . A systematic review and meta- analysis were conducted to analyze the effects of  dual task and training application  on static and dynamic postural stability among  various population groups .  Systematic identification of published literature was performed adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta- analysis ( PRISMA ) guidelines , from inception until June 2016 , on the online data bases Scopus , PEDro , MEDLINE , EMBASE , and SportD iscus . Experimental studies analyzing the effects of  dual task and dual-task training  on postural stability were extracted , critically appraised using PEDro scale , and then summarized according to modified PEDro level of evidence .  Of 1,284 records , 42 studies involving 1,480 participants met the review ’s inclusion criteria .  Of the studies evaluating the effects of  dual-task training  on  postural stability  , 87.5 % of the studies reported  significant enhancements  , whereas 30 % of the studies evaluating acute effects of dual tasks on posture reported  significant enhancements  , 50 % reported significant decrements , and 20 % reported no effects . Meta- analysis of the pooled studies revealed  moderate but significant enhancements  of dual-task training   in  elderly participants  ( 95 % CI : 1.16–2.10 ) and in  patients  suffering from chronic stroke ( −0.22 to 0.86 ) .  The adverse effects of  complexity of  dual tasks on postural stability  were also revealed among  patients with  multiple sclerosis ( −0.74 to 0.05 ) . The review also discusses the  significance of verbalization  in a  dual-task  setting  for increasing cognitive – motor interference .  Clinical implication s are discussed with respect to practical applications in rehabilitation setting."
" Available trial data do not provide evidence that advancing enteral feed volumes at daily increments of 15 to 20 mL/kg ( compared with 30 to 40 mL/kg ) reduces the  risk of NEC or death  in  very preterm or VLBW infants , extremely preterm or ELBW infants , SGA or growth-restricted infants , or infants with antenatal AREDFV .  Advancing the volume of enteral feeds at a slow rate results in several days of delay in establishing full enteral  feeds  and may increase the risk of invasive infection."
" The present study showed an  overall reduction of cardiovascular risk  after  bariatric surgery .  According to our analysis  a BMI reduction  of 5 after surgery corresponds to a  type II diabetes reduction  of 33 % ( as reported by Peluso and Vanek ( Nutr Clin Pract 22(1):22–28 , 2007 ) ; SAS Institute Inc. , ( 2000–2004 ) ) , a  hypertension reduction  of 27 % ( as reported by Buchwald and Oien ( Obes Surg 23(4):427–436 , 2013 ) ; Valera-Mora et al.

( Obes Surg 17(2):176–184 , 2007 ) . In summary , our study showed that  laparoscopic bariatric surgery  is an effective therapeutic option to  reduce the cardiovascular risk  in severe obese patients."
"pObjective The purpose of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to examine the effect of  health information technology ( HIT ) diabetes self-management education ( DSME ) interventions  on  glycemic control  in  medically underserved patients .  Material s and Methods Following an a priori protocol ,  5 data bases  were search ed . Studies were appraised for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment . Studies reporting either  hemoglobin  A1c pre- and post-intervention or its change at 6 or 12 months were eligible for inclusion in the meta- analysis using r and om effects models . Results  Thirteen studies met the criteria for the systematic review and 10 for the meta- analysis and represent data from 3257 adults with diabetes ( mean age 55 years ; 66 % female ; 74 % racial/ethnic minorities ) .  Most studies ( n = 10 ) reflected an unclear risk of bias . Interventions varied by HIT type :  computer software without Internet  ( n = 2 ) ,  cellular/automated telephone  ( n = 4 ) ,  Internet-based  ( n = 4 ) , and  telemedicine/telehealth  ( n = 3 ) .  Pooled A1c decreases  were found at 6 months ( -0.36 ( 95 % CI , -0.53 and -0.19 ] ; I 2 = 35.1 % , Q = 5.0 ) , with diminishing effect at 12 months ( -0.27 [ 95 % CI , -0.49 and -0.04 ] ; I 2 = 42.4 % , Q = 10.4 ) . Discussion Findings suggest that  medically underserved patients with diabetes  achieve  glycemic benefit  following HIT DSME interventions , with dissipating but significant effects at 12 months .  Telemedicine/telehealth  interventions were the most successful HIT type because they incorporated interaction with educators similar to in-person DSME . Conclusion These results are similar to in-person DSME in  medically underserved patients  , showing that well- design ed HIT DSME has the potential to increase access and improve outcomes for this vulnerable group."
"nBACKGROUND Early studies demonstrated relatively low success rates for  pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI )  alone in  patients with persistent atrial fibrillation ( PeAF ) .  However , the advent of new technologies and the observation that additional substrate ablation does not improve outcomes have created a new focus on  PVI  alone for treatment of PeAF . OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to systematic ally review the recent medical literature to determine current medium-term outcomes when a  PVI-only  approach is used for PeAF . METHODS An electronic data base search ( MEDLINE , Embase , Web of Science , PubMed , Cochrane ) was performed in August 2016 .  Only studies of PeAF patients undergoing a  "" PVI only "" ablation strategy using contemporary radiofrequency ( RF ) technology or second-generation cryoballoon ( CB2 )  were included  . A r and om-effects model was used to assess the primary outcome  of pooled single-procedure 12-month arrhythmia-free survival .  Predictors of recurrence were also examined and a meta- analysis performed if ≥4 studies examined the parameter . RESULTS  Fourteen studies of 956 patients , of whom 45.2 % underwent PVI only with RF and 54.8 % with CB2 , were included  .  Pooled single-procedure 12-month arrhythmia-free survival  was 66.7 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 60.8%-72.2 % ) , with the majority of patients ( 80.5 % ) off antiarrhythmic drugs .  Complication rates  were very low , with  cardiac tamponade  occurring in 5 patients ( 0.6 % ) and  persistent phrenic nerve palsy  in 5 CB2 patients ( 0.9 % of CB2 )  . Blanking period recurrence  ( hazard ratio 4.68 , 95 % CI 1.70 - 12.9 ) was the only significant predictor of recurrence .   A PVI-only strategy  in  PeAF patients with a low prevalence of structural heart disease  using contemporary technology yields excellent outcomes comparable to those for paroxysmal AF ablation."

"sBackground There are no r and omised and properly blinded trials directly comparing one  PDE-5  inhibitor with another in a normal home setting . Valid indirect comparisons with a common comparator must examine equivalent doses , similar duration , similar population s , with the same outcomes reported in the same way . Methods Published r and omised , double-blind trials of  oral PDE-5  inhibitors  for erectile dysfunction  were sought from reference lists in previous review s and electronic search ing . Analyses of  efficacy and  harm were carried out for each treatment , and results compared where there was a common comparator and consistency of outcome reporting , using equivalent doses . Results Analysis was limited by differential reporting of outcomes .  Sildenafil  trials were clinical ly and geographically more diverse .  Tadalafil  and  vardenafil  trials tended to use enriched enrolment . Using all trials , the three interventions were similar for consistently reported  efficacy outcomes . Rates of successful intercourse  for  sildenafil , tadalafil  and  vardenafil  were 65 % , 62 % , and 59 % , with  placebo  rates of 23–28 % .  The rates of improved erections  were 76 % , 75 % and 71 % , respectively , with placebo rates of 22–24 % , and NNTs of 1.9 or 2.0 . Reporting  of withdrawals  was less consistent , but all-cause  withdrawals  for  sildenafil , tadalafil  and  vardenafil  were 8 % 13 % and 20 % . All three drugs were  well tolerated  , with  headache  being the most commonly reported event at 13–17 % . There were few  serious adverse events  . Conclusion There were differences between trials in outcomes reported , limiting comparisons , and the most useful outcomes were not reported . For common outcomes there was similar efficacy between PDE-5 inhibitors."
"FThe aim of the present systematic review is to present an overview of the evidence linking  atrial fibrillation ( AF )  , inflammation and oxidative stress , with emphasis on the potential of  statins  to decrease the incidence of different types of  AF  ,  including new-onset AF , after electrical cardioversion ( EC ) and after cardiac surgery .  Observational and clinical trials have studied the impact of  statin therapy  on  new-onset , post-EC or postoperative AF .  Data from different observational trials have shown that treatment with  statins  significantly reduces the  incidence of new-onset AF  in the primary and secondary prevention . The data are insufficient to recommend the use of  statins  before EC . Finally ,  perioperative statin therapy  may represent an important non-antiarrhythmic adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the prevention of postoperative AF."

"dHyperuricemia is linked to gout and features of metabolic syndrome . There is concern that dietary fructose may increase  uric acid concentrations  . To assess the effects of  fructose  on  serum uric acid concentrations  in  people with and without diabetes  , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of controlled feeding trials . We search ed MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library for relevant trials ( through August 19 , 2011 ) . Analyses included all  controlled feeding trials ≥7 d  investigating the effect of  fructose feeding  on  uric acid  under  isocaloric conditions  , where  fructose was isocalorically exchanged with other carbohydrate  ,  or hypercaloric conditions  , and where  a control diet was supplemented with excess energy from fructose  . Data were aggregated by the generic inverse variance method using r and om effects models and expressed as mean difference ( MD ) with 95 % CI . Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified by I2 .  A total of 21 trials in 425 participants met the eligibility criteria .  Isocaloric exchange of fructose for other carbohydrate did not  affect serum uric acid  in  diabetic and nondiabetic participants  [ MD = 0.56 μmol/L ( 95 % CI : −6.62 , 7.74 ) ] , with no evidence of inter- study heterogeneity .  Hypercaloric supplementation of control diets with fructose  ( + 35 % excess energy ) at extreme doses ( 213–219 g/d )  significantly increased serum uric acid  compared with the control diets alone in nondiabetic participants [ MD = 31.0 mmol/L ( 95 % CI : 15.4 , 46.5 ) ] with no evidence of heterogeneity . Confounding from  excess energy  can not be ruled out in the hypercaloric trials . These analyses do not support  a uric acid-increasing effect   of  isocaloric fructose intake in nondiabetic  and diabetic participants  .  Hypercaloric fructose  intake may , however ,  increase uric acid concentrations  . The effect of the interaction of energy and fructose remains unclear . Larger , well- design ed trials  of fructose  feeding at “ real world ” doses are needed."
"sObjective The purpose of this study was to systematic ally review and critically analyze the published data of in vitro studies testing the effect of  root  canal  sealers  on the  fracture resistance  of  endodontically treated teeth .  Methods A comprehensive literature search was performed by using the Medline , Scopus , Web of Science , Cochrane , and Open Grey data bases . A h and search of the reference lists of identified articles was also performed . Two review ers critically assessed the studies for eligibility against inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed data extraction . Evaluation of the risk of bias of the studies was performed . Results  A total of 48 studies were assessed for eligibility .  Of these ,  20 met the inclusion criteria and were included  in the systematic review . All studies had a medium or high risk of bias . Although the majority of the studies reported that the use of  root canal sealers  increased the  fracture resistance  of endodontically treated teeth , conflicting evidence was found for the reinforcing effect of  resin , glass ionomer  , and  calcium silicate-based sealers  while there was moderate evidence for  zinc oxide eugenol-based sealers  in favor of no reinforcing effect . Conclusion On the basis of available evidence , the use of  root canal sealer  increases the  fracture resistance  of  endodontically treated teeth  . However , included studies presented considerable risk of bias . Regarding the comparisons among the sealers , no conclusions could be drawn for the superiority of one sealer type to another . Clinical relevance A considerable heterogeneity was found in the method ologies of included studies . Therefore , this review strongly suggests the development of st and ardized methods to test the reinforcement effect of root canal filling material s in in vitro studies."
"yAim and background Reducing inflammation by  nutritional supplements  may help to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases . Our aim in this meta- analysis was to determine the effect of  L-carnitine  on inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Methods Our systematic search to find relevant  r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs )  was performed up to October 2018 using ISI Web of Science , Google Scholar , PubMed / Medline , and SCOPUS . In this meta- analysis , the weighted mean differences ( WMD ) with st and ard errors ( SE ) were used to pool the data . WMD was calculated by subtracting change-from-baseline mean values in the control group from change-from-baseline mean values in the intervention group in each study . To identify heterogeneity among studies , the I2 statistic was employed . The protocol was registered with PROSPERO ( No. CRD42019116695 ) . Results  Thirteen articles were included in our systematic review and meta- analysis .  The results of the meta- analysis indicated  that L-carnitine supplementation  was significantly associated with  lower levels of CRP  in comparison to controls ( WMD = −1.23 mg/L ; 95 % CI : −1.73 , −0.72 mg/dL ; P < 0.0001 ) . Also , a slight but statistically significant decrease was  observed in IL-6 and TNF-α levels  ( WMD = −0.85 pg/dL ; 95 % CI : −1.38 , −0.32 pg/dL ; P = 0.002 and WMD = −0.37 pg/dL ; 95 % CI : −0.68 , −0.06 pg/dL ; P = 0.018 , respectively ) . Conclusion Our results indicate   that  L-carnitine   reduced inflammatory mediators  , especially in studies with a duration of more than 12 weeks . Further studies with different doses and intervention duration s and separately in  men and women  are necessary."
"s[ Purpose ] This study investigated whether the  Canadian Occupational Performance Measure  is a suitable outcome measure for assessing  patients with stroke in research and clinical setting  s. [ Subjects and Methods ] The study included into two parts : ( 1 ) an investigation of the reliability and validity of the  Canadian Occupational Performance Measure  for  patients with stroke  and ( 2 ) an exploration of  Canadian Occupational Performance Measure  results in r and omized controlled trials of  patients with stroke .  For this review , the study search ed the MEDLINE , PubMed , and CINAHL Plus with Full Text data bases for articles published before September 2015 . [ Results ] Finally ,  three eligible articles were collected in part 1  , and  ten r and omized controlled trials studies were collected in part 2  . The findings of part 1 revealed that the  Canadian Occupational Performance Measure  had  efficient test – retest reliability  , however , the  Canadian  Occupational  Performance  Measure revealed weak associations with  other assessment tools  such as  Barthel Index  used for patients with stroke . Six of the r and omized controlled trials studies used  the  Canadian Occupational Performance Measure   as a primary outcome and two as a secondary outcome , while the other two as a goal - setting instrument . [ Conclusion ] This review indicates that the  Canadian Occupational Performance Measure  is appropriate for clinicians , including physiotherapists , in assessing outcome for patients with stroke . The  Canadian Occupational Performance Measure  can assist patients in identifying their outcome performance and provide therapists with directions on interventions."
" In this third up date of the Cochrane review , there were no differences in effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of  supplements of vitamins B6 , B9  or  B12  given alone or in combination comparing with  placebo  on  myocardial infa rct ion , death from any cause or adverse events .  In terms of stroke , this review found a small difference in effect favouring to homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of  supplements of vitamins B6 , B9 or B12  given alone or in combination comparing with  placebo .  There were uncertain effects of  enalapril plus folic acid  compared with  enalapril  on stroke ; approximately 143 ( 95 % CI 85 to 428 ) people would need to be treated for 5.4 years to prevent 1 stroke , this evidence emerged from one mega-trial . Trial sequential analyses showed that additional trials are unlikely to increase the certainty about the findings of this issue regarding homocysteine-lowering  interventions versus placebo .  There is a need for additional trials comparing homocysteine-lowering  interventions  combined with  antihypertensive medication versus antihypertensive medication  , and homocysteine-lowering  interventions  at high doses versus  homocysteine-lowering interventions  at low doses . Potential trials should be large and co-operative."

"sPURPOSE We performed two parallel systematic review s and meta-analyses to determine the association between  early migration of tibial components  and  late  aseptic revision .   METHODS One review comprised  early migration data  from  radiostereometric analysis ( RSA ) studies  , while the other focused on revision rates for  aseptic loosening  from long-term survival studies . Thresholds for acceptable and unacceptable migration were determined according to that of several national joint registries : < 5 % revision at 10 years . RESULTS Following an elaborate literature search ,  50 studies ( involving 847 total knee prostheses ( TKPs ) ) were included in the  RSA review  and 56 studies ( 20,599 TKPs ) were included in the  survival review  .  The results showed that for every mm increase in migration there was an 8 % increase  in revision rate  , which remained after correction for age , sex , diagnosis , hospital type , continent , and study quality . Consequently , migration up to 0.5 mm was considered acceptable during the first postoperative year , while migration of 1.6 mm or more was unacceptable . TKPs with migration of between 0.5 and 1.6 mm were considered to be at risk of having  revision rates  higher than 5 % at 10 years . INTERPRETATION There was a clinical ly relevant association between  early  migration  of TKPs  and  late revision for loosening .  The proposed migration thresholds can be implemented in a phased , evidence -based introduction of new types of knee prostheses , since they allow early detection of high-risk TKPs while exposing only a small number of patients."

"nThe clinical sequelae of oestrogen deficiency during menopause are undoubted . However , the pathophysiological role of  testosterone  during the menopause is less clear . Several r and omized ,  placebo-controlled  clinical trials suggest that  testosterone therapy  improves  sexual function  in  postmenopausal women .  Some studies suggest that  testosterone therapy  has additional effects , which include  increased bone mineral density and decreased serum high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol .  Furthermore , the long-term  safety profile  of  testosterone therapy  in  postmenopausal women  is not clear . This article will provide a concise and critical summary of the literature , to guide clinicians treating postmenopausal women."
"hBACKGROUND Approximately 188 million people use cannabis yearly worldwide , and it has recently been legalised in 11 US states , Canada , and Uruguay for recreational use . The potential for increased cannabis use highlights the need to better underst and its risks , including the acute induction of psychotic and other psychiatric symptoms . We aim ed to investigate the effect of the cannabis constituent  Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC )  alone and in combination  with cannabidiol ( CBD )  compared with  placebo  on psychiatric symptoms in  healthy people .  METHODS In this systematic review and meta- analysis , we search ed  MEDLINE , Embase , and PsycINFO for studies published in English between data base inception and May 21 , 2019  , with a within-person , crossover design . Inclusion criteria were  studies reporting symptoms using  psychiatric scales (  the Brief  Psychiatric Rating Scale [ BPRS  ] and the  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [ PANSS  ] )  following the acute administration of intravenous , oral , or nasal  THC , CBD , and placebo  in  healthy participants  , and presenting data that allowed calculation of  st and ardised mean change ( SMC ) scores  for positive  ( including delusions and hallucinations )  ,  negative ( such as blunted affect and amotivation )  , and  general ( including depression and anxiety )  symptoms . We did a r and om-effects meta- analysis to assess the main outcomes of the  effect sizes for total , positive , and negative PANSS and BPRS scores  measured in healthy participants following THC administration versus placebo . Because the number of studies to do a meta- analysis on CBD 's moderating effects was insufficient , this outcome was only systematic ally review ed . This study is registered with PROSPERO , CRD42019136674 . FINDINGS 15 eligible studies involving the acute administration of THC and four studies on CBD plus THC administration were identified . Compared  with placebo ,  THC  significantly increased total symptom severity  with a large effect size ( assessed in nine studies , with ten independent sample s , involving 196 participants : SMC 1·10 [ 95 % CI 0·92 - 1·28 ] , p<0·0001  ) ; positive symptom severity  ( assessed in 14 studies , with 15 independent sample s , involving 324 participants : SMC 0·91 [ 95 % CI 0·68 - 1·14 ] ,  p<0·0001 ) ; and negative symptom severity  with a  large effect  size ( assessed in 12 studies , with 13 independent sample s , involving 267 participants : SMC 0·78 [ 95 % CI 0·59 - 0·97 ] , p<0·0001 ) . In the systematic review , of the four studies evaluating  CBD 's  effects on THC-induced symptoms , only one identified a significant  reduction in  symptoms . INTERPRETATION A single  THC  administration  induces psychotic , negative , and other psychiatric symptoms  with large effect sizes . There is no consistent evidence that  CBD  induces symptoms or moderates the effects of THC . These findings highlight the potential risks associated with the use of cannabis and other cannabinoids that contain THC for recreational or therapeutic purpose s.

"dAbstract  Probiotics  are increasingly being used to treat and prevent  urogenital infections  . However , a critical assessment of their efficacy in major urogenital infections is lacking . We report the results of a systematic review to determine the  efficacy  of  probiotics  for prevention or treatment of  three major urogenital infections : bacterial vaginosis , vulvovaginal c and idiasis , and urinary tract infection .  Using multiple computeriz ed data bases , we extracted data from clinical trials using a  lactobacillus-containing preparation  to either prevent or treat a urogenital infection . Of  25 included studies ,  18  studies  used  lactobacillus preparations  for treatment or prevention of urogenital infections and seven studies focused solely on vaginal colonization .  Four studies included patients with vaginal c and idiasis , five included patients with urinary tract infections , and eight included patients with bacterial vaginosis . One  included several types of genitourinary infections . Overall , lactobacilli were beneficial for the treatment of  patients with bacterial vaginosis .  No clear benefit was seen for c and  idiasis  or  urinary tract infection  . Studies were heterogenous , with some limited by a small population size . In conclusion , the use of certain lactobacillus strains such as L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri for prevention and treatment of  recurrent urogenital infection  is  promising  , especially for recurrent bacterial vaginosis . Scant data on the use of probiotics for urinary tract infection and vulvovaginal c and idiasis precludes definitive recommendations . Further research and larger studies on types of lactobacilli strains , dosage of lactobacilli , optimal route and vehicle of administration are needed."

The results indicated that  four studies met  the inclusion criteria . Statistically significant difference was found between the  success rates  of  MTA  and  calcium hydroxide  treated teeth that needed direct pulp capping ( P=0.002 ) . Clinical  assessment  s of the  MTA  versus  calcium hydroxide  for direct pulp capping suggested that  MTA  was superior to calcium hydroxide in direct pulp capping result ing in a lower  failure rate  ( risk difference 0.1 [ 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.16 ] ) . In conclusion ,  MTA  has a higher  clinical success rate  for direct pulp capping comparing to  calcium hydroxide  , and might be a suitable replacement for calcium hydroxide."
"eMobile-bearing  ( MB )  total knee replacement  (  TKR  )  was introduced to reduce the risk of aseptic loosening and wear of polyethylene inserts . However , no consistent clinical advantages of  mobile- over fixed-bearing ( FB ) TKR  have been found . In this study we evaluated whether mobile bearings have an advantage over fixed bearings with regard to revision rates and clinical outcome scores . Furthermore , we determined which modifying variables affected the outcome . A systematic search of the literature was conducted to collect clinical trials comparing  MB and FB  in  primary TKR .  The primary outcomes were  revision rates for any reason , aseptic loosening and wear .  Secondary outcomes included  range of movement , Knee Society score ( KSS ) , Oxford knee score ( OKS ) , Short-Form 12 ( SF-12 ) score and radiological parameters .  Meta-regression techniques were used to explore factors modifying the observed effect .  Our search yielded 1827 publications , of which 41 studies met our inclusion criteria , comprising over 6000 TKRs .  Meta-analyses showed no clinical ly relevant differences in terms of  revision rates , clinical outcome scores or patient-reported outcome measures  between  MB  and  FB  TKRs  .  It appears that theoretical assumptions of superiority of  MB  over  FB TKR  are not borne out in clinical practice."

"sMany chronic diseases and illnesses are caused by the lifestyle , including the physical activity habits , of an individual . As such , consistent high levels of  exercise  should be encouraged across the lifespan , to limit the risk of developing one of these conditions and allowing for healthy aging to occur .  Exercise prescriptions  that encourage high completion and adherence rates in an independent manner and improve health related outcomes should be provided to individuals . To date , no review has identified optimal prescriptions of  exercise  to achieve this in  sedentary middle-aged adults  and this is important , given the higher risk of developing illnesses in this population as they age . This review examines the effects prescriptions of  self-directed ( SD ) exercise  has on  adherence  and  health  related outcomes in  sedentary middle-aged individuals in good general health  currently and aims to identify the most suitable forms of  planned SD exercise  that can be carried out independently . A systematic search of the electronic data base PubMed was conducted .  R and omised controlled trials  published  in English between February 2007 and February 2017 examining healthy , sedentary middle-aged participants only  were included . Studies were critically appraised using the PEDro scale and data were presented on st and ardised tables . Twenty-one articles examining different aerobic activities , combined training and  non-traditional exercise  prescriptions were included . This review summarised in detail the effects   SD  exercise interventions  had on  sedentary middle-aged individuals  alongside the adherence to the prescriptions .  SD exercise  was seen to be beneficial for improving metabolic outcomes physical characteristics , cardiorespiratory fitness and functional measures."

"yOBJECTIVE to determine the effects of  power training  with high movement velocity compared with  conventional resistance training  with low movement velocity for  older community-dwelling people .  DESIGN systematic review of r and omised controlled trials . DATA SOURCES the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled TRIALS , PubMed ( Medline ) , EMBASE , CINAHL , PEDro and Scholar-Google . TRIALS all r and omised or quasi-r and omised trials investigating  power training with high movement velocity versus conventional resistance training with low movement velocity  in  elderly persons over the age of 60 years .  The primary outcomes were  measures of functional outcomes ;  secondary outcomes were  balance , gait , strength , power , muscle volume and adverse effects .  RESULTS  eleven trials were identified involving 377 subjects .  The pooled effect size for the follow-up values of the  functional outcomes  was 0.32 in favour of the  power training  ( 95 % CI 0.06 to 0.57 ) and 0.38 ( 95 % CI -0.51 to 1.28 ) for the change value . The pooled effect from three studies for  self-reported function  was 0.16 in favour of  power training  ( 95 % CI -0.17 to 0.49 ) .   power training  is feasible  for elderly persons  and has a small advantage over strength training for functional outcomes . No firm conclusion can be made for safety."

" The findings from the 2 meta-analyses of the effects of probiotic administration on the prevention  of NEC  show potential for such dietary supplementation . However , they must be interpreted with caution because the beneficial effects of probiotics seem to be strain specific , thus , pooling data from different strains may result in misleading conclusions .

" Our analyses found no evidence of a difference in  total mortality or cardiovascular outcomes  for  ARBs  as compared with  ACE inhibitors  , while  ARBs  caused slightly fewer  WDAEs  than  ACE inhibitors .  Although  ACE inhibitors  have shown efficacy in these outcomes over  placebo  , our results can not be used to extrapolate the same conclusion for  ARBs  directly , which have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials for hypertension . Thus , the substitution of an  ARB  for an  ACE inhibitor  , while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability , must be made in consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of  ARBs  regarding  mortality and morbidity outcomes  compared with  ACE inhibitors .  Additionally , our data mostly derives from  participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension  , and it would be useful to have data from  asymptomatic people  to increase the generalizability of this review . Unpublished subgroup data of  hypertensive participants  in existing trials comparing  ACE inhibitors  and  ARBs  needs to be made available for this purpose."
")Testosterone  deficiency ( TD )  may induce a series of clinical symptoms . Studies have shown that  testosterone supplementation  may prevent these unfavourable symptoms and improve patients ’ quality of life . Given the conflicting findings across studies , this systematic review aims to evaluate the effects and risks associated with  testosterone supplementation  in  middle-aged or aging males with TD .  Electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , EMBASE , PubMed , and Cochrane . Library were search ed to December 2019 . The risk of bias of individual included studies and the quality of the aggregate evidence were assessed using the GRADE approach . Our primary outcome was  bone mineral density ( BMD )  . Meta-analyses were performed . This systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA statement .  A total of 52 r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) were included .  When compared with  placebo , testosterone supplementation  did not  increase total BMD  ( short-term : 1081 participants , MD − 0.01 g/cm2 , 95 % CI − 0.02 g/cm2 to 0.01 g/cm2 ; long-term : 156 participants , MD 0.04 g/cm2 , 95 % CI − 0.07 g/cm2 to 0.14  g/cm2 ) , lumbar spine , hip , or femur neck BMD  . Furthermore ,  testosterone supplementation  did not  decrease the risk of falling or fracture  . Lastly , it was found  that testosterone supplementation  did not  increase the risk of cardiovascular events  ( 1374 participants , RR 1.28 , 95 % CI 0.62 to 2.64  ) , all-cause mortality  ( 729 participants , RR 0.55 , 95 % CI 0.29 to 1.04  ) , or prostatic events  .   However  , testosterone supplementation   may improve sexual function and quality of life  ( 1328 participants , MD -1.32 , 95 % CI − 2.11 to − 0.52 ) . The  effect of testosterone  supplementation  on BMD and the risk of falls or fracture  remains inconclusive . However , supplementation may benefit patients in the  areas of sexual function and quality of life without increasing the risk of cardiovascular events , all-cause mortality , or prostatic events  . RCTs with a longer follow-up period are still required . We registered our protocol in PROSPERO ( CRD42018109738 )."
"sAntioxidant  micronutrients and essential fatty acids supplementation  intake appears to have a protective effect in some diseases such as cardiovascular disease , cancer , and asthma . The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review to evaluate the effects of these nutrients on nutritional and clinical outcomes of  patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) .  This is a systematic review of r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) in CF . MEDLINE ( via PubMed ) , Embase , and Scopus data bases were search ed for  RCTs published from 1948 through February 2019 .  Two investigators independently review ed the titles and abstract s and then extracted the data from the included studies using a st and ardized pre design ed form . Two review ers independently performed the quality assessment of the RCTs according to the Cochrane risk of bias tools .  A total of 4,792 studies were identified , and 23 were eligible ( 8 antioxidant  micronutrient  and 15 essential  fatty acids )  .  The interventions found were  beta-carotene , zinc , magnesium , multivitamin , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , linoleic acid and lipid matrix with choline supplementation .  A significant improvement was observed in : ( a )  pulmonary function  with magnesium ( n=1 ) and essential  fatty acids  ( n=2 ) supplementation ; ( b )  less pulmonary exacerbations  with  beta-carotene  ( n=1 ) ,  zinc  ( n=1 ) ,  antioxidant-enriched multivitamin  ( n=1 ) and  essential fatty acids  ( n=2 ) supplementation . One study with antioxidant-enriched multivitamin and four studies with  EPA/DHA supplementation  reported significant  reductions  in  inflammatory markers . Nutritional status  was not modified by  antioxidants supplementation  in any of the studies , while in five studies there was an improvement with  fatty acids supplementation .  The  risk of bias  of the majority of the parallel studies was high . The benefits of  antioxidants or DHA/EPA supplementation  for CF , although observed in some studies , are not consistent enough to recommend routine use of these supplements . The mechanisms of action of these nutrients , dose levels and timing should be further explored in future studies."

"eObjective : To determine the factors associated with  physical activity participation  in  adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis .  Methods : A systematic review was conducted including search es of AMED , PsycINFO , CINAHL , MEDLINE , EMBASE , PubMed and the Cochrane Library from inception until October 2013 . Studies presenting quantitative correlates of  physical activity  in  adults with hip and /or knee osteoarthritis  were included . Two independent authors conducted the search es , extracted data and completed method ological quality assessment . Correlates were analysed using the summary  code  approach within the  socio-ecological model  . Results : A total of  170 correlates  were identified from  29 publications analysing 8076 individual people with hip or knee osteoarthritis .   Method ological quality  was generally good . For knee osteoarthritis , factors consistently negatively associated with physical activity ( reported more than four studies ) were increasing age ( number of  participants  in studies supporting association = 4558 ) , non-white ethnicity ( n =  3232  ) , increased  osteoarthritis symptoms  ( n = 2374 ) and female gender ( n = 4816 ) .  Greater lower limb function  ( n = 1671 ) and  faster gait speed  were ( n = 4098 ) positively associated with physical activity .  Social (  e.g.  support  from  spouse  ( n = 141 ) ) and  environment ( outdoor temperature  ( n = 38 ) ) factors were identified as possible factors that influence physical activity . For hip osteoarthritis ,  higher body mass index  ( n = 99 ) ,  increased comorbidities  ( n = 1021 ) ,  lower mental health  ( n = 189 ) and  unemployment  ( n = 65 ) were negatively associated with physical activity ; while  better social functioning  ( n = 1055 ) and  health-related quality of life  were positively associated with physical activity ( n = 34 ) . Conclusion : Demographic , physical , social , psychological and environmental factors are all important correlates for physical activity for  people with knee or hip osteoarthritis  . Clinicians should consider these in clinical practice."
"sThe assessment of  physical activity  in  healthy population s and in those with chronic diseases  is challenging . The aim of this systematic review was to identify whether available  activity monitors  ( AM ) have been appropriately vali date d for use in assessing physical activity in these groups . Following a systematic literature search we found  134 papers meeting the inclusion criteria ; 40 conducted in a field setting  (  validation  against   doubly labelled water  )   , 86 in a laboratory setting (   validation against a metabolic cart , metabolic chamber  )  and 8 in a field and laboratory setting .  Correlation coefficients between AM outcomes and  energy expenditure ( EE )  by the criterion method  ( doubly labelled water  and  metabolic  cart/chamber ) and  percentage mean differences between EE estimation  from the monitor and EE measurement by the criterion method were extracted . R and om-effects meta-analyses were performed to pool the results across studies where possible . Types of devices were compared using meta-regression analyses . Most validation studies had been performed in  healthy adults ( n = 118 )  , with few carried  out in patients with chronic diseases ( n = 16 ) .  For  total EE  ,  correlation coefficients  were statistically significantly lower in uniaxial compared to multisensor devices . For  active EE  , correlations were slightly but not significantly lower in uniaxial compared to triaxial and multisensor devices . Uniaxial devices tended to  underestimate TEE  ( −12.07 ( 95%CI ; -18.28 to −5.85 ) % ) compared to triaxial ( −6.85 ( 95%CI ; -18.20 to 4.49 ) % , p = 0.37 ) and were statistically significantly  less accurate  than multisensor devices ( −3.64 ( 95%CI ; -8.97 to  1.70  ) %  , p<0.001 ) . TEE  was underestimated during slow walking speeds in 69 % of the lab validation studies compared to 37 % , 30 % and 37 % of the studies during intermediate , fast walking speed and running , respectively . The high level of heterogeneity in the validation studies is only partly explained by the  type of activity monitor and the activity monitor  outcome .  Triaxial and multisensor  devices tend to be more valid monitors . Since activity monitors are less accurate at slow walking speeds and information about vali date d activity monitors in chronic disease population s is lacking , proper validation studies in these population s are needed prior to their inclusion in clinical trials."
"tAIMS The 6  min walk test  ( 6MWT ) is commonly used in clinical trials to assess treatments for heart failure , but its ability to distinguish between effective and ineffective treatments is question able . The aim of this study is to investigate , using a systematic literature review , the utility of the 6MWT as a measure of the effectiveness of treatment in  r and omized controlled trials of heart failure .  METHODS AND RESULTS A literature search was performed using Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , and Biological abstract s for  r and omized controlled trials that measured 6MWT between 1988 and 31 May 2004 .  A significant increase in  6MWT distance  was observed in only 9 of  47 r and omized controlled trials of  pharmacological therapy  ;  2 of 6 trials of  ACE-inhibitors ;  3 of  17  trials of  beta-blockers ;  1 of 4 trials of  digoxin ;  one trial of  ibopamine ;  one trial of  l-arginine ;  one trial of  beriberine ;  and one trial showed superiority of  captopril over flosequinan .  A significant increase in  6MWT  was observed in four out of six  placebo-controlled  trials of cardiac resynchronization . Smaller pharmacological trials with fewer centres were more likely to be positive ; six out of nine positive pharmacological trials had four or less participating centres , raising the possibility of publication bias . Pharmacological trials including patients with more severe heart failure were more likely to show a significant improvement with therapy than trials of milder heart failure . Five out of seven pharmacological trials that reported an  improvement in symptoms  also reported an improvement in  6MWT distance .  Of  30 pharmacological trials  , 29 that reported no  improvement in symptoms  also reported no improvement in  6MWT .  Using mean values in these trials , the age of patients appeared a more important determinant of  6MWT distance  than New York Heart Association classification .  The 6MWT has not yet been proven to be a robust test for the identification of effective pharmacological interventions although it appears useful for the assessment of cardiac resynchronization therapy . The results of the 6MWT were concordant with changes in symptoms , suggesting that it may be used as supportive evidence for symptom benefit . The test may be of greater value in  patients with more advanced heart failure  , where it may function as a maximal exercise test."
" Despite most of the included studies being of low quality , the results suggest that  iodine supplementation  , especially  iodised oil  , is an effective means of decreasing  goitre rates  and improving iodine status in  children .  Indications of positive effects on  physical and mental development and mortality  were seen , although results were not always significant .  Adverse effects  were generally minor and transient . Insufficient evidence was available on  non-oil supplements .  High quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address the question of the best form of  iodine supplementation  in different population groups and setting."

"sThere existed systematic review on studies investigating the association between  hip fractures  and external risk factors including meteorological factors . Albeit the fact that most serious common fall injury is a hip fracture , it can not account for all injuries forms of fall . There was a lack of systematic review covering all  fall-related injury or deaths  to thoroughly summarise meteorological aspects of fall . This study aim ed to systematic ally review epidemiological studies of fall and fall-related circumstances without restriction to hip fracture . A systematic search in three data bases , namely PubMed , CINAHL Plus and EMBASE , was performed . Search es in  two Chinese data  bases named the Wanfang Med Online and the China Journal Net were done in addition . A  total of 29 studies were identified .  The study site , fall cases identification , meteorological factors and findings of all the selected studies were being extracted . The quality of the studies was critically appraised . We identified some of the environmental risk factors to fall among those studies . Ranging from the lower ambient temperature , the presence of snow cover , seasonal factors , and time of the day to location of fall , these factors have different levels of impact related to higher  incidence or mortality of fall .  To conclude , a better underst and ing of injury mechanisms is a prerequisite for preventive interventions."
"tEndometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease characterized by sustained painful symptoms that are responsible for a decline in the quality of life of sufferers .  Conventional treatment  includes  surgical and pharmacological therapy  aim ing at reducing  painful symptoms .  This study aim ed to evaluate  pain levels  in  women with endometriosis  , focusing on the influence of  conventional treatment  in controlling this variable . To do so , a literature search was conducted in the Medline  / Pubmed data bases  , with  119 scientific articles found .  After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria ,  27 were selected for reading and elaboration of this review .  Thus , 9 studies evaluated the contribution of  surgery  , 17 the use of  drugs  to reduce  pain levels  in  patients with endometriosis  and one assessed  surgical and medical treatment .  The main results of these search es are presented and discussed in this revision . Surgery and the use of drugs provided reduced  pain scores  in  patients with endometriosis  but nevertheless exhibit disadvantages , such as  risk of recurrence and side effects  , respectively . Treatment of endometriosis is , therefore , a challenge for gynecologists and patients , as they must select the best therapeutic approach for this disease . However , improved  quality of life  in these patients has been obtained with the use of conventional treatment."

"sPostmenopausal  hormone replacement therapy ( HRT )  is one of the most commonly prescribed drug regimens in the United States . This pattern of use reflects a large number of  postmenopausal women  , many of whom choose to take  HRT  to treat symptoms of  menopause  . Also contributing to the high prevalence of use has been significant publicity aim ed at physicians and women regarding the effect of  HRT  on intermediate biological outcomes , such as lipid levels ( 1 ) and bone density , and its potential effect in decreasing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) as well as several other serious diseases , such as Alzheimer disease and colon cancer . Cardiovascular disease , primarily coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , is the leading cause of death among  women in the United States .  Many observational studies and analyses have suggested that  HRT  protects against CVD . However , in the past 4 years , three secondary prevention trials ( 2 - 4 ) and , most relevantly , the Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) primary prevention study ( 5 ) have shown no benefit or increased  rates  of  CVD events  among  women  r and omly assigned to  HRT .  These results were surprising to many because of the benefit shown in many observational studies and because estrogen use is associated with many effects that could have favorable effects on CVD , including lower  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  ( 6 ) , lower  lipoprotein(a ) levels  ( 7 ) , and increased  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  ( 8) . However ,  HRT  is also associated with potentially unfavorable effects , including increased  levels of triglycerides (  6  ) , factor VII , and C-reactive protein  ( 8) and  decreased levels of antithrombin III  ( 6 ) . Given the mix of intermediate biological outcomes , limitations of observational data , and recent trial results , we conducted this systematic review and meta- analysis to examine the value of  HRT  for the primary prevention of CVD . We were particularly interested in whether bias might explain discordant results between recent trials and the observational literature . Our review is one of several that will serve as background for the Third U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) recommendations on  HRT  and the prevention of chronic diseases . Methods We search ed the topic of   HRT   and  CVD and CAD  in the MEDLINE and Cochrane data bases from 1966 to  December  2000 . We also used bibliographies of original research and other publications to identify studies for review . Criteria for inclusion in the systematic review were evaluation of  HRT  and the primary prevention of CVD , CAD , or both among  postmenopausal women  and availability of an English- language abstract for review . We included r and omized , controlled trials , and cohort and casecontrol studies if they evaluated CVD or CAD incidence or mortality . We did not review cross-sectional studies because they are limited by prevalence bias . Two investigators review ed all abstract s to identify papers for full-text review . We abstract ed study data and created evidence tables organized by study type . Definitions of current , past , recent , never , and ever use were taken directly from the individual studies ( Appendix Tables 1 and 2 ) . Hormone use was classified in each study as  unopposed estrogen replacement therapy or estrogen plus progesterone combined therapy  when it was specified , which was infrequent . When the type of  estrogen or progesterone therapy  was not specified , the exposure was categorized as  HRT .  Definitions of  CVD and CAD events  were taken directly from the review ed studies . Most often ,  CVD mortality  was defined by International Classification of Disease codes or World Health Organization criteria or included any death result ing from any type of CVD or CVD-related procedure , including  stroke , CAD , sudden cardiac death  ,  congestive heart failure  , peripheral  vascular disease  ,  coronary artery bypass  graft surgery , or percutaneous  transluminal coronary angioplasty  . Coronary artery disease is a subset of CVD . For the purpose s of this review ,  CAD deaths  included all  fatal myocardial infa rct ions , sudden cardiac deaths  , or both attributed to CAD  ; CAD events  included  myocardial infa rct ion  , coronary artery  bypass graft  surgery , percutaneous  transluminal coronary angioplasty  , and , in some studies ,  angina .  In an effort to measure a global effect on CVD , as well as a more specific effect on CAD , we evaluated CVD and CAD separately when the data allowed . Two investigators independently rated the quality of each study based on criteria created by the Third USPSTF ( 9 ) ; discrepancies were adjudicated by a third review er . These criteria are shown in Table 1 . Appendix Tables 1 and 2 show each study 's rating by quality  .  In ranking the quality of observational studies , we gave significant weight to adequate control of potential CVD risk factors because of known differences in risk profiles among  women who use  HRT   and those who do not ( 10 , 11 ) . Table 1 . U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Categories for Rating Internal Validity of Studies After review ing and rating the studies , we limited our formal review and meta-analyses to only studies rated as fair or good quality and included r and  omized  , controlled trials ; population -based , casecontrol studies ; and cohort studies with internal controls and at least 3 years of follow-up . In studies with multiple publications from the same cohort or population , only data from the most recent publication were included in the meta-analyses , with reference in the text to older publications if they presented unique findings . To evaluate each study 's control of confounding variables that might explain their results , for each outcome and each study providing data relevant to the outcome , we listed potential CVD risk factors included in the multivariable models determining relative risk . These included age , diabetes , hypertension , smoking , lipid levels , family history , exercise , socioeconomic status , education level , alcohol use , body mass index , and others . Definitions for the presence or absence of these factors , as well as their assessment , are taken directly from the included studies . This research was funded by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality under a contract to support the work of the USPSTF . Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality staff and USPSTF members participated in the initial design of the study and review ed interim analyses and the final manuscript . Since our report was prepared for the Third USPSTF , it was distributed for review to 15 content experts and revised accordingly before preparation of this manuscript . For each outcome , a meta-analytic model was fitted , stratifying by HRT exposure status : current , past , and ever ( if the study did not report results for current and past use separately ) . The model also allowed for a global effect of HRT to be estimated ; this is referred to as the effect of any HRT exposure ( current , ever , or past ) . Our primary analysis compared  event rates in  patients with any  HRT  use   ( current , past , or ever use ) to those who had never  used HRT  . We also compared  event rates in current , past , or ever HRT use groups  to  never use  to further evaluate variable findings among the studies . Results by category of use are shown in Table 2 . All  relative risk estimates  are compared with never use . Estimation was made by using the Bayesian data analytic framework , in which the analogue to the confidence interval is the  credible interval ( CrI )  ( 16 ) . Further details of the meta- analysis are given in the Appendix . Table 2 . Meta- Analysis Summary Table Results Scope of Literature The MEDLINE search identified  3035 abstract s of papers evaluating primary prevention published between 1966 and December 2000 .  From them ,  24 cohort studies ; 18 casecontrol studies ; one very small r and omized , controlled trial ;  and  one meta- analysis  were review ed . After the quality of the studies was rated , 20  observational studies  ; one  r  and omized , controlled trial conducted among institutionalized  women  ; and 1  meta-  analysis that combined data from  23 r and omized , controlled trials of  HRT  for outcomes other than CVD ( such as bone density or lipid levels )  were included in our meta-analyses . Data from studies grade d as poor quality were not included in the meta-analyses . Our search results are shown in the Appendix Figure . We review ed  18 casecontrol studies and  rated  6  as poor quality , generally because of very small size , poor evaluation of CVD risk factors , or potential bias in selection of controls ( 17 - 22 ) . We excluded 1 study ( 23 ) because data were provided in an up date d study . Five of the excluded studies did not report risk estimates , 2 suggested decreased risk , and 1 suggested increased risk ( Appendix Table 3 ) . The major difference between studies rated as good or fair quality was in adjustment for CVD risk factors .  Twenty-four cohort studies were review ed for inclusion in the meta-analyses  , and  11 were excluded  because  of poor  quality ( 24 - 34 ) , usually because they had little or no adjustment for CVD risk factors , they used external controls , or the entire cohort was exposed to HRT .  Four studies  were excluded because the data were up date d ( 35 - 37 ) or published in another form ( 38 ) . Qualitatively , fair- quality studies had  relative risks  similar to those of good- quality studies ( range , 0.21 to 1.94 ) . However , all of the poor- quality cohort studies had  relative risks or st and ardized mortality ratios  significantly below 1 ( range , 0.27 to 0.79 ) ( Appendix Table 3 ) .  Cardiovascular and Coronary Artery Disease Mortality  All of the studies contributing to our mortality analyses were  prospect i ve cohort studies  , except for a nested  casecontrol  study from the Nurses  ' Health  Cohort . There was little variation among the cohort studies and this study ; therefore , these studies were combined . Similarly , when stratified by study quality ( fair or good ) in the meta-analyses , the findings were similar and the results were combined . More details about the studies are presented in Appendix Tables 4 and 5 . Among 8 observational studies."

In  breastfed infants  , evidence suggests that a hypoallergenic maternal diet may be beneficial for reducing  symptoms of colic .  In  formula-fed infants  ,  colic  may improve after changing from a  st and ard cow ’s milk formula  to either a  hydrolysed protein formula  or a  soy-based formula . Fibre-supplemented formulae  had no effect . Removal of poorly digested carbohydrates from the infant ’s diet has promise , but additional clinical studies must be conducted before a recommendation can be made . Use of a universal definition to measure  symptoms of infantile colic  and consistent analysis of urine and faecal sample s would improve the evidence in this area."
" about the effectiveness of  exercise therapy  were based on the results presented in reasonable or good quality systematic review s ( quality score > or = 60 out of 100 points ) . A total of  104 systematic review s were selected  , 45 of which were of reasonable or good quality .  Exercise therapy  is  effective  for  patients  with knee osteoarthritis , sub-acute ( 6 to 12 weeks ) and chronic ( > or = 12 weeks )  low  back pain , cystic fibrosis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and intermittent claudication . Furthermore , there are indications that  exercise  therapy   is  effective  for patients with ankylosing spondylitis , hip osteoarthritis , Parkinson 's disease , and for patients who have suffered a stroke . There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the  effectiveness of  exercise therapy   for  patients with neck pain , shoulder pain , repetitive strain injury  ,  rheumatoid arthritis , asthma  ,  and bronchiectasis .    Exercise therapy  is not effective  for   patients with acute low back pain .   It is concluded that  exercise therapy  is  effective  for a wide range of chronic disorders."
"sThe current systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) was conducted to evaluate the potential effect of  melatonin supplementation  on   blood pressure  in patients with metabolic disorders .  The following data bases were search ed until June 2018 : PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . Two review ers independently assessed the eligibility of retrieved studies , extracted data from included trials , and evaluated the risk of bias of included studies . Statistical heterogeneity was tested using Cochran ’s Q test and I-square ( I2 ) statistic . Data were pooled using r and om-effect models and st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) was considered as the effect size .  Eight RCTs , out of 743 potential citations  ,  were  eligible to be included in the current meta- analysis . The pooled findings indicated a significant  reduction in systolic ( SBP )  ( SMD = −0.87 ; 95 % CI , −1.36 , −0.38 ; P = 0.001 ; I2  : 84.3 ) and diastolic blood pressure  ( DBP ) ( SMD = −0.85 ; 95 % CI , −1.20 , −0.51 ; P = 0.001 ; I2 : 68.7 ) following melatonin supplementation in individuals with metabolic disorders . In summary , the current meta- analysis demonstrated  that melatonin supplementation   significantly decreased  SBP and DBP  in patients with metabolic disorders .  Additional prospect i ve studies are recommended using higher supplementation doses and longer intervention periods to confirm our findings."
"]QUESTION What are typical values of physical function for  women diagnosed with breast cancer  and how do these compare to normative data ? DESIGN Systematic review with meta- analysis . PARTICIPANTS  Women diagnosed with breast cancer who were before , during or after treatment .  OUTCOME MEASURES Physical function was divided into three categories : aerobic capacity , upper and lower extremity muscular fitness , and mobility  .  Measures of aerobic capacity included   field tests (  6-minute  walk test  , 12-minute  walk tests  , Rockport 1-mile test , and 2-km walk time )  and  submaximal/maximal exercise tests on a treadmill or cycle ergometer .  Measures of upper and lower extremity  muscular fitness  included  grip strength , one repetition maximum ( bench , chest or leg press ) , muscle endurance tests , and chair st and s.  The only measure of  mobility  was the  Timed  Up and  Go test .  RESULTS  Of the 1978 studies identified , 85 were eligible for inclusion .  Wide ranges of values were reported , reflecting the range of ages , disease severity , treatment type and time since treatment of participants .  Aerobic fitness values  were generally below average , although  6-minute walk time  was closer to population norms .  Upper and lower extremity strength  was lower than population norms for women who were currently receiving cancer treatment .  Lower extremity strength  was above population norms for women who had completed treatment .   Aerobic capacity and upper extremity strength  in women diagnosed with breast cancer are generally lower than population norms . Assessment of values for  lower extremity strength  is less conclusive . As more research is published , expected values for sub-groups by age , treatment , and co-morbidities should be developed .

"IBACKGROUND Meta-analyses and a recent guideline acknowledge that conservative management of uncomplicated  appendicitis  with  antibiotics  can be successful for  patients who wish to avoid surgery .  However , guidance as to specific management does not exist . METHODS PUBMED and EMBASE search of trials describing methods of conservative treatment was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines . RESULTS  Thirty-four studies involving 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants were identified .  The greatest experience with conservative treatment is in  persons 5 to 50 years of age .  In most trials , imaging was used to confirm localized appendicitis without evidence of abscess , phlegmon , or tumor .  Antibiotics  regimens were generally consistent with intra-abdominal infection treatment guidelines and used for a total of 7 to 10 days . Approaches ranged from 3-day hospitalization on  parenteral agents  to same-day hospital or ED discharge of  stable patients with  outpatient oral antibiotics .    Minimum time allowed before response  was evaluated varied from 8 to 72 hours . Although  pain  was a common criterion for nonresponse and appendectomy , analgesic regimens were poorly described . Trials differed in use of other response indicators , that is ,  white blood cell count , C-reactive protein , and reimaging .  Diet ranged from restriction for 48 hours to as tolerated .  Initial response rates  were generally greater than 90 % and most participants improved by 24 to 48 hours , with no related  severe sepsis or deaths .  In most studies , appendectomy was recommended for recurrence ; however , in several , patients had antibiotic retreatment with success .  While further investigation of conservative treatment is ongoing , patients considering this approach should be advised and managed according to study methods and related guidelines to promote informed shared decision-making and optimize their chance of similar outcomes as described in published trials . Future studies that address biases associated with enrollment and response evaluation , employ best- practice pain control and antibiotic selection , better define cancer risk , and explore longer time thresholds for response , minimized diet restriction and hospital stays , and antibiotic re-treatment will further our underst and ing of the potential effectiveness of conservative management .

"dEvidence on the association between   physical activity  ( PA )  and  adiposity in young children  is inconclusive . A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to examine associations between  accelerometer-derived PA  and  varying adiposity outcomes   in preschool children .  Search es were conducted in Embase , MEDLINE and Web of Science to identify studies on the association between   total  PA  , sedentary behaviour  or  different PA  intensities and adiposity in children aged 2 to 7 years .  Separate r and om effects meta-analyses were performed for varying PA intensities and adiposity outcomes .  Fifty-six articles were included in the review and 48 in the meta-analyses .  There was substantial evidence of an inverse association  between moderate-to-vigorous-  or  vigorous  PA  and body fat percentage  ( stdβ [ SE ] = -0.162[0.041 ] ; 5 studies )  , weight status  ( r = -0.120 , P<.001 ; 11  studies ) , fat mass  ( stdβ [ SE ] = -0.103[0.051 ] ; 5  studies ) , fat mass index  ( stdβ [ SE ] = -0.121[0.036 ] ; 2  studies  )  and skinfold thickness  ( stdβ [ SE ] = -0.145[0.036 ] ; 4  studies  ) .   However , total PA , sedentary behaviour  ,  and different PA  intensities  were  not associated with body mass index ( BMI ) or waist circumference . Adiposity levels  were lower among  preschool children  engaged in more  ( moderate-to- ) vigorous PA  compared with their peers , but no associations   between   PA  and  BMI or waist circumference were found."

"tBACKGROUND Poor adherence to anti-diabetic medications contributes to suboptimal  glycaemic control  in  patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) .  A range of interventions have been developed to promote anti-diabetic medication adherence . However , there has been very little focus on the characteristics of these interventions and how effectively they address factors that predict non-adherence . In this systematic review we assessed the characteristics of interventions that aim ed to promote adherence to anti-diabetic  medications  . METHOD Using appropriate search terms in Medline , Embase , CINAHL , International Pharmaceutical Abstract s ( IPA ) , PUBmed , and PsychINFO ( years 2000 - 2013 ) ,  we  identified  52 studies which met the inclusion criteria .  RESULTS  Forty-nine studies consisted of patient-level interventions , two provider-level interventions , and one consisted of both .  Interventions were classified as  educational  ( n = 7 ) , behavioural ( n = 3 ) , affective , economic ( n = 3 ) or multifaceted ( a combination of the above ; n = 40 ) . One study consisted of two interventions . The review found that multifaceted  interventions  , addressing several non-adherence factors , were comparatively more effective in improving  medication adherence and glycaemic target  in  patients with T2D  than single strategies . However , interventions with similar components and those addressing similar non-adherence factors demonstrated mixed results , making it difficult to conclude on effective intervention strategies to promote adherence .  Educational strategies  have remained the most popular intervention strategy , followed by behavioural , with affective components becoming more common in recent years . Most of the interventions addressed  patient-related  ( n = 35 ) ,  condition-related  ( n = 31 ) , and  therapy-related  ( n = 20 ) factors as defined by the World Health Organization , while fewer addressed health care system ( n = 5 ) and socio-economic-related factors ( n = 13 ) .  There is a noticeable shift in the literature from using single to multifaceted intervention strategies addressing a range of factors impacting adherence to medications . However , research limitations , such as limited use of st and ardized methods and tools to measure adherence , lack of individually tailored adherence promoting strategies and variability in the interventions developed , reduce the ability to generalize the findings of the studies review ed . Furthermore , this review highlights the need to develop multifaceted interventions which can be tailored to the individual patient 's needs over the duration of their diabetes management."
"nBackground Post-orthodontic  white-spot lesions ( WSL )  in esthetically relevant incisor and canine areas impair dentofacial esthetics , and preventive dentistry treatment is definitely required in case of enamel cavitations . The incidence of lingual post-orthodontic WSL and cavitation following lingual  MB  treatment has been reported to be distinctively decreased compared to labial  MB  treatment . Moreover , lingual WSL do not impair dentofacial esthetics . It was the objective of this study to calculate  consequential costs  of  preventive  dental care necessary to recover labial or lingual post-orthodontic cavitations as well as esthetically relevant WSL following either labial or lingual MB interventions . Methods  MB  treatments ( labial / lingual ) were simulated in  1,000,000 patients between the ages of 12 - 18Y , with a median residual life time expectancy of 58Y based on local mortality tables .  Range of MB Tx duration was 9–45 mo . Frequencies of  post-orthodontic ( labial / lingual ) enamel  damages were derived from large-scale WSL incidence studies . Anterior composite survival rates were based on a systematic review on the subject . Within the context of the German dental fee system ( GOZ 2.3 and 3.5 fee increments ) , simulation of costs for  enamel damage  treatment and re-treatment ( maximum : 5x ) were based on  single-surface composite restorations for lingual or labial cavitations and labial WSL treatment ;  and  lingual WSL fluoridation .  Results  Overall mean total costs for Tx and re-Tx  of both WSLs and cavitations may sum up to 1718.91 Eur in the high-cost ( GOZ 3.5 ) scenario for conventional MB cases , versus 19.94 Eur for lingually treated cases , given that renewal of simulated single-surface restorations takes place at 15-year intervals . When focussing on patients diagnosed with least of one WSL , and /or cavitation , these  mean costs  increase up to 2332.35 Eur for conventionally treated MB patients , or 65.03 Eur for lingual MB patients . Conclusion  Costs  for repeated  treatment  of  post-orthodontic enamel damages  produced by conventional vestibular fixed appliances may easily exceed the initially higher costs associated with lingual orthodontic treatment . Judged economically in the long term , lingual MB Tx may be considered as a more  cost-effective solution  for a correction of malocclusion."
"lBACKGROUND The benefits of  blood pressure lowering treatment  for prevention of cardiovascular disease are well established . However , the extent to which these effects differ by baseline blood pressure , presence of comorbidities , or drug class is less clear . We therefore performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to clarify these differences . METHOD For this systematic review and meta- analysis , we search ed MEDLINE for  large-scale blood pressure lowering trials , published between Jan 1 , 1966 , and July 7 , 2015  , and we search ed the  medical  literature to identify  trials up to Nov 9 , 2015 . All r and omised controlled trials of blood  pressure lowering  treatment were eligible for inclusion if they included a minimum of 1000 patient-years of follow-up in each study arm . No trials were excluded  because of  presence of baseline comorbidities  , and trials of  antihypertensive   drugs  for indications other than hypertension were eligible . We extracted summary -level data about study characteristics and the outcomes  of major cardiovascular disease events , coronary heart disease , stroke , heart failure , renal failure , and all-cause mortality .  We used inverse variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analyses to pool the estimates . RESULTS We identified  123 studies with 613,815 participants for the tabular meta- analysis .  Meta-regression analyses showed  relative risk reductions  proportional to the magnitude of the blood pressure reductions achieved . Every 10 mm Hg  reduction in systolic blood pressure significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular disease events  ( relative risk [ RR ] 0·80 , 95 % CI 0·77 - 0·83 )  , coronary heart disease  ( 0·83 , 0·78 - 0·88 ) ,  stroke  ( 0·73 , 0·68 - 0·77 ) ,  and heart failure  ( 0·72 , 0·67 - 0·78 ) , which , in the population s studied , led to a significant 13 %  reduction in all-cause mortality  ( 0·87 , 0·84 - 0·91 ) . However , the effect  on  renal failure was not significant ( 0·95 , 0·84  -  1·07 ) . Similar  proportional risk  reductions ( per 10 mm Hg  lower systolic blood  pressure ) were noted in trials  with higher mean baseline systolic blood pressure  and trials with  lower mean baseline systolic blood pressure  ( all ptrend>0·05 ) . There was no clear evidence  that proportional risk reductions in major cardiovascular disease  differed by baseline disease history , except for diabetes and chronic kidney disease , for which smaller , but significant , risk reductions were detected . β blockers were inferior to other drugs for  the prevention of major cardiovascular disease events , stroke , and renal  failure  . Calcium channel blockers  were superior to other drugs for the prevention of  stroke .  For the prevention of  heart failure  ,  calcium channel blockers  were inferior and  diuretics  were superior to other drug classes . Risk of bias was judged to be low for  113 trials  and unclear for  10 trials  .  Heterogeneity for outcomes  was low to moderate ; the  I(2 )  statistic for heterogeneity for  major cardiovascular disease events  was 41 % , for coronary heart disease 25 % , for stroke 26 % , for heart failure 37 % , for renal failure 28 % , and for all-cause  mortality  35 % . INTERPRETATION Blood pressure lowering significantly reduces  vascular risk  across various baseline blood pressure levels and comorbidities . Our results provide strong support for lowering  blood pressure to systolic blood pressures  less than 130 mm Hg and providing blood pressure lowering treatment to  individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease , coronary heart disease , stroke , diabetes , heart failure , and chronic kidney disease .

"3OBJECTIVE To provide information and recommendations to assist  women with breast cancer and their physicians  in making decisions regarding the use of  locoregional  post-mastectomy  radiotherapy ( PMRT ) .  OUTCOMES  Locoregional control , disease-free survival , overall survival and treatment-related toxicities .  EVIDENCE This guideline is based on a review of all meta-analyses , consensus statements and other guidelines published between 1966 and November 2002 . Search es of MEDLINE and CANCERLIT for English- language r and omized controlled trials published between 1995 and November 2002 were also conducted to supplement the literature previously review ed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) Health Services Research Committee panel in its published guideline . A non systematic review of the literature was continued through June 2003 . RECOMMENDATIONS Locoregional  PMRT  is recommended for  women with an advanced primary tumour ( tumour size 5 cm or greater , or tumour invasion of the skin , pectoral muscle or chest wall ) .  Locoregional  PMRT  is recommended for  women with 4 or more positive axillary lymph nodes .  The role of  PMRT  in  women  with 1 to 3  positive axillary lymph nodes  is unclear . These women should be offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials of  PMRT .  Locoregional  PMRT  is generally not recommended for women who have  tumours  that  are  less  than 5  cm  in diameter  and who have  negative axillary nodes .  Other patient , tumour and treatment characteristics , including age , histologic grade , lymphovascular invasion , hormone receptor status , number of axillary nodes removed , axillary extracapsular extension and surgical margin status , may affect locoregional control , but their use in specifying additional indications for  PMRT  is currently unclear .  PMRT  should encompass the chest wall and the supraclavicular , infraclavicular and axillary apical lymph node areas . To reduce the risk of lymphedema , radiation of the entire axilla should not be used routinely after complete axillary dissection of level I and II lymph nodes . A definite recommendation regarding the inclusion of the internal mammary lymph nodes in  PMRT  can not be made because of limited and inconsistent data . The use of modern techniques in radiotherapy planning is recommended to minimize  excessive normal tissue exposure  , particularly to the cardiac and pulmonary structures . Common short-term side effects of  PMRT  , including  fatigue and skin erythema  , are generally tolerable and not dose-limiting . Severe long-term side effects , including  lymphedema , cardiac and pulmonary toxicities , brachial plexopathy , rib fractures and secondary neoplasms  , are relatively rare . The optimal sequencing of  PMRT  and systemic therapy is currently unclear . Regimens containing anthracyclines or taxanes should not be administered concurrently with  radiotherapy  because of the potential for increased  toxicity .  VALIDATION The authors ' original text was su bmi tted for review , revision and approval by the Steering Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Care and Treatment of Breast Cancer . Subsequently , feedback was provided by 11 oncologists from across Canada . The final document was approved by the steering committee . SPONSOR The Steering Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Care and Treatment of Breast Cancer was convened by Health Canada . COMPLETION DATE : November 2003."
" We identified eligible trials on  quetiapine , risperidone  and  olanzapine .  The available data on  olanzapine  and risperidone are too limited to draw any conclusions . Monotherapy with quetiapine seems to be efficacious in reducing  symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder  and this effect may be similar to that of antidepressants . However , quetiapine 's efficacy must be weighed against its lower tolerability."
"nBACKGROUND Physicians diagnose and treat suspected  hypogonadism in older men  by extrapolating from the defined clinical entity of hypogonadism found in  younger men .  We conducted a systematic review to estimate the accuracy of clinical symptoms and signs for predicting  low testosterone  among  aging men .  METHODS We search ed the  MEDLINE and Embase data bases ( January 1966 to July 2014 )  for studies that compared clinical features with a  measurement of serum testosterone  in men . Three of the authors independently review ed articles for inclusion , assessed quality and extracted data . RESULTS Among  6053 articles identified , 40 met the inclusion criteria .  The prevalence of  low testosterone  ranged between 2 % and 77 % .  Threshold testosterone levels  used for reference st and ards also varied substantially . The summary likelihood ratio associated with  decreased libido  was 1.6 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.3 - 1.9 ) , and the likelihood ratio for absence of this finding was 0.72 ( 95 % CI 0.58 - 0.85 ) . The  likelihood ratio  associated with the  presence of erectile dysfunction  was 1.5 ( 95 % CI 1.3 - 1.8 ) and with  absence of erectile dysfunction  was 0.83 ( 95 % CI 0.76 - 0.91 ) . Of the multiple-item instruments , the AND ROTEST showed both the most favourable positive likelihood ratio ( range 1.9 - 2.2 ) and the most favourable negative likelihood ratio ( range 0.37 - 0.49 ) . INTERPRETATION We found weak correlation between  signs , symptoms and testosterone levels  , uncertainty about what threshold testosterone levels should be considered low for aging men and wide variation in estimated prevalence of the condition . It is therefore difficult to extrapolate the method of diagnosing pathologic hypogonadism in younger men to clinical decisions regarding age-related testosterone decline in aging men."
"dPurpose of review This review provides an appraisal of recent evidence for or against  selenium supplementation  in  patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases  , and discusses possible effect mechanisms . Recent findings Epidemiological data suggest an increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroid diseases under conditions of low dietary  selenium  intake . Two systematic review s have evaluated controlled trials among  patients with autoimmune thyroiditis  and report that  selenium supplementation  decreases  circulating thyroid autoantibodies .  The immunomodulatory effects of selenium might involve reducing  proinflammatory cytokine release .  However , clinical ly relevant effects of  selenium supplementation  , including improvement in  quality of life  , are more elusive . In Graves  ’  disease , some , but not all , trials indicate that  adjuvant selenium supplementation  enhances the  restoration of biochemical euthyroidism  , and might benefit  patients with mild Graves ’ orbitopathy .  Summary The use of  selenium supplementation  as adjuvant therapy to st and ard thyroid medication may be widespread , but a growing body of evidence yields equivocal results . The available evidence from trials does not support routine  selenium supplementation  in the st and ard treatment of patients with  autoimmune thyroiditis or Graves ’ disease  . However , correction of moderate to severe selenium deficiency may offer benefits in preventing , as well as treating , these disorders . Molecular mechanisms have been proposed , but further studies are needed."

"sAims Despite widespread adoption of  contact force ( CF ) sensing technology  in  atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation  , r and omized data suggests lack of improvement in clinical outcomes . We aim ed to assess the  safety and efficacy  of  CF-guided vs. non CF-guided AF ablation .  Methods and results Electronic data bases were search ed for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and controlled observational studies ( OS ) comparing outcomes of   AF ablation   performed  with vs. without CF guidance .  The primary efficacy endpoint was  freedom from AF  at follow-up . The primary safety endpoint was  major peri-procedural complications .  Secondary endpoints included  procedural , fluoroscopy , and ablation duration .  Subgroup analyses were performed by AF type and study design  . Nine RCTs ( n = 903 ) and 26 OS ( n = 8919 ) were included .  Overall ,  CF guidance  was associated with improved  freedom from AF  [ relative risk ( RR ) 1.10 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.02 - 1.18 ] , and reduced  total procedure duration  [ mean difference ( MD ) 15.33 min ; 95 % CI 6.98 - 23.68 ] ,  ablation duration  ( MD 3.07 min ; 95 % CI 0.29 - 5.84 ) , and  fluoroscopy duration  ( MD 5.72 min ; 95 % CI 2.51 - 8.92 ) . When restricted to RCTs however ,  CF guidance  neither improved  freedom from AF  ( RR 1.03 ; 95 % CI 0.95 - 1.11 ) , independent of AF type , nor did it reduce  procedural , fluoroscopy , or ablation duration .  Contact force guidance did not reduce the  incidence of major peri-procedural complications  ( RR 0.89 ; 95 % CI 0.64 - 1.24 ) . Conclusion Meta- analysis of r and omized data demonstrated that  CF guidance  does not improve the  safety or efficacy  of AF ablation , despite initial observational data showing dramatic improvement . Rigorous evaluation in r and omized trials is needed before widespread adoption of new technologies."
"nObjective : To investigate the psychometric properties of  measures of balance  and  falls  risk  prediction  in  people with Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) .  Data sources : PubMed , Embase , CINAHL , Ovid Medline , Scopus , and Web of Science were search ed from inception to August 2019 . Review method : Studies testing psychometric properties of  measures of balance  and falls risk  prediction  in  PD  were included . The four-point COnsensus-based St and ards for the selection of  health Measurement INstruments  ( COSMIN ) assessed quality . Results :  Eighty studies testing 68 outcome measures were review  ed ;  43 measures  assessed balance ,  9  assessed falls risk prediction , and  16  assessed both . The measures with robust psychometric estimation with acceptable properties were the  (  1 )   Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems  Test ( Mini-BEST ) , ( 2 ) Berg Balance Scale , ( 3 ) Timed Up and Go test , ( 4 ) Falls Efficacy Scale International , and ( 5 ) Activities-Specific Balance Confidence scale .  These measures assess  balance and falls risk  prediction at the body , structure and function level ,  falls risk and balance  ,  and falls risk  at the activity level . The motor examination of the  Unified Parkinson ’s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS-ME )  with robust psychometric analysis is a condition-specific measure with acceptable properties . Except the  UPDRS-ME  and  Mini-BESTest  , the responsiveness of the other four measures has yet to be established . Conclusion : Six of the 68 outcome measures have strong psychometric properties for the assessment of balance and falls risk prediction in PD . Measures assessing balance and falls risk prediction at the participatory level are limited in number with a lack of psychometric validation."

" This systematic review indicates that  iron supplementation  increases   Hb levels  in children significantly  but modestly . The increase is greater in  subjects who are anaemic at the start of the trial  and  lower in malarial hyperendemic areas  and in those  consuming iron-fortified  food . The projected reductions in prevalence of anaemia with  iron  supplementation alone highlight the need for additional area-specific interventions , particularly in  malaria-prone regions ."
"wAnorexia  nervosa ( AN )  is a psychiatric disorder with a high mortality and unknown etiology , and effective treatment is lacking . For decades , cannabis has been known to cause physical effects on the human body , including increasing appetite , which may be beneficial in the treatment of AN . To systematic ally review the literature for evidence of an effect of  cannabinoids  on (  1 ) weight gain , and ( 2 ) other outcomes  , in AN . A systematic review was done using three data bases Embase , PubMed and Psychinfo . The review was registered in PROSPERO with ID number CRD42019141293 and was done according to PRISMA guidelines .  There were 1288 studies identified  and after thorough review and exclusion of copies ,  4 studies met  the inclusion  criteria  . Three studies used the same AN population and utilized data from one original study , leaving only two original studies . Both of these were R and omized Controlled Trials that explored the effects  of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ) or dronabinol  in AN , whereof one study was properly design ed and powered and showed a  weight increase  of an added 1 kg over 4 weeks  over placebo .  There are few studies and the level of evidence is low . The only properly design ed , low bias and highly powered study found  a weight increasing effect   of  dronabinol in AN , while the other , using  Δ9-THC  at a high dose , found no effect and where the dose may have counteracted the  weight gaining effects  due to adverse events .

"eThromb Haemost 2008 ; 100 : 11–13 Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the commonest sustained cardiac rhythm disorder , which has particularly attracted much clinical and research interest from the mortality and morbidity associated with stroke and thromboembolism . The more chronic presentations of AF have clinical subtypes based on the temporal pattern of the arrhythmia – AF is considered recurrent when a patient experiences two or more episodes , which may be paroxysmal if they terminate spontaneously , defined by consensus as seven days , or persistent if the arrhythmia requires cardioversion for termination of the arrhythmia ( 1 ) . Although paroxysmal AF is common , the associated stroke risk is less defined , given the limited information on its clinical epidemiology and the under-representation of these patients in clinical trials . As Gladstone et al. ( 2 ) highlight , it really depends on how hard we look for  paroxysmal AF  in  patients who present with an acute stroke or thromboembolism .  It has long been recognized that paroxysmal AF is frequently asymptomatic , and it has been estimated that only 1 in 12 paroxysms of AF are symptomatic ( 3 ) . In their data from the  prospect  i  ve Registry  of the Canadian Stroke Network , Gladstone et al. ( 2 ) found that 17 % of  12,849 consecutive hospitalised ischemic stroke patients  had a history of  AF  , and an additional 6 % had new  AF  detected whilst in hospital ( 4 % on admission electrocardiogram [ ECG ] and 2 % detected later in hospital ) .

( 4 ) , a  st and ard 12-lead ECG  identified  AF  in 2.7 % of 149 acute stroke and transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) patients at admission and in 4.1 % of remaining patients within five days ; however , a  24-hour ECG recording  (  Holter )  detected  AF  in 5 % of patients who had a normal st and ard ECG , whereas seven-day  ambulatory ECG monitoring using an event-loop recording  ( ELR ) device detected  AF  in 5.7 % of patients with a normal st and ard ECG and normal Holter . Unsurprisingly , a recent systematic review of a series of cohort studies reemphasises the importance of screening for  occult AF  after ischemic stroke and TIA given that an extended duration of  ECG monitoring  ( e.g. event loop recorder [ ELR ] , etc ) after stroke/TIA identifies many more patients with ( usually paroxysmal ) AF than st and ard ECG and Holter monitoring alone ( 5 ) . Another recent report found that in  patients with acute ischemic stroke  , even frequent  atrial premature beats ( APBs )  recorded in  24-hour  ECG ( ≥70 per 24 hours ) were a marker for subsequent paroxysmal AF ( 6 ) . Clearly , more rhythm monitoring investigations would be needed for  subjects with acute stroke and /or thromboembolism  , to define the relationship between paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias and stroke."
"DBackground : Despite the widespread use of antidepressants in clinical practice , the current trial‐ and ‐error approach to medication selection contributes to treatment failure and underscores the need to identify reliable predictors of antidepressant response . Since changes in  measures of cognition  have been reported to occur early in treatment and prior to improvements in overall mood symptoms , the present review aims to determine whether early changes in measures of cognition can predict response in individuals  with MDD .  Methods : A systematic review of studies evaluating  early cognitive change  as a predictor of  later treatment response  in  MDD  was conducted using PubMed / Medline , Embase and PsychINFO . Results :  A total of seven articles were identified .  The available evidence suggests the  early changes in cognition  may predict treatment response in  individuals with MDD .  This was shown across antidepressant classes  ( i.e.  ,  SSRIs , SNRIs , NRIs , melatonergic antidepressants )  and forms of therapy  ( i.e.  ,  pharmacotherapy , rTMS )  . The results depict an emerging trend towards  early changes in facial emotion recognition  ( i.e. , a hot cognitive process ) as a predictor of treatment outcome . Limitations : Our qualitative analysis reflects a very limited number of studies . Moreover , there was significant heterogeneity in the  evaluation of cognition  across studies . Future research should aim to parse out this heterogeneity by evaluating the  relative predictive value of different measures of cognition .  Conclusion : The identification of reliable early treatment  predictors of antidepressant response  would be clinical ly significant , enabling clinicians to more accurately evaluate the efficacy of selected treatment avenues . HIGHLIGHTSCognitive  dysfunction  is a principal feature and determinant of health outcome in MDD.Cognitive  changes  have shown to occur prior to improvements in mood symptoms .  Early changes in emotional processing  may predict treatment response in MDD."
"MScope Studies have demonstrated inconsistent effects of  curcumin  on  glycemic outcomes and lipid parameters  in  patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) .  This study aim ed to assess the effect of  curcumin  on  glycemic control and lipid profile  in  prediabetes and T2DM  . Methods and results A systematic search of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) was conducted from inception to June 2018 in electronic sources including AMED , ANZCTR , BioMed Central , CENTRAL , CINAHL , Clinical Trials.gov , Exp and ed Academic Index , Google Scholar , IS RCT N , LILACS , MEDLINE , NCCIH , Science Direct , Scopus , Web of Science , and WHO ICTRP . H and search was also performed .  Of the total 486 records , four trials ( N = 508 ) and eight trials ( N = 646 ) were eligible for the meta- analysis of individuals with prediabetes and T2DM , respectively .   Curcumin  significantly  reduced glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c )  in prediabetics ( MD : -0.9 % , 95 % CI : -1.7 to -0.1 % , p = 0.03 ) . Furthermore , T2DM subjects gained favorable reduction in  both  HbA1c ( MD : -0.5 % , 95 % CI : -1.0 to -0.0 % ,  p = 0.04 ) and fasting plasma glucose  ( MD : -11.7 mg/dL , 95 % CI : -22.1 to -1.3 mg/dL ,  p = 0.03 )  . Tendency of  lipid profile improvement  was also observed . Conclusion Our findings may encourage curcumin supplementation based on its meaningful effect on  glycemic control  and positive trend on  lipid outcomes  in prediabetes and T2DM."
"sAlthough certain risk factors can identify individuals who are most likely to develop chronic  pain  , few interventions to prevent chronic pain have been identified . To facilitate the identification of preventive interventions , an IMMPACT meeting was convened to discuss research design considerations for clinical trials investigating the prevention of chronic pain . We present general design considerations for  prevention  trials  in population s  that are at relatively high risk for developing  chronic pain  . Specific design considerations included subject identification , timing and duration of treatment , outcomes , timing of assessment , and adjusting for risk factors in the analyses . We provide a detailed examination of 4 models of chronic pain prevention (  ie  ,  chronic postsurgical pain , postherpetic neuralgia , chronic low back pain  ,  and painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy )  . The issues discussed can , in many instances , be extrapolated to other chronic pain conditions . These examples were selected because they are representative models of primary and secondary prevention , reflect persistent pain result ing from multiple insults ( ie , surgery , viral infection , injury , and toxic or noxious element exposure ) , and are chronically painful conditions that are treated with a range of interventions . Improvements in the design of chronic pain prevention trials could improve assay sensitivity and thus accelerate the identification of efficacious interventions . Such interventions would have the potential to reduce the prevalence of  chronic pain  in the population . Additionally , st and ardization of outcomes in prevention clinical trials will facilitate meta-analyses and systematic review s and improve detection of preventive strategies emerging from clinical trials."
" There is suggestive but inconclusive evidence from the trials of a benefit in the use of brief interventions for risk factor modification in  patients with coronary heart disease .  This review , however , supports the concept that brief interventions for  patients with coronary heart disease  can have beneficial effects on risk factor modification and consequently on progression of coronary heart disease . Further trials using larger sample sizes need to be undertaken to demonstrate the benefits of  brief structured intervention  targeted at the modification of single or multiple risk factors."
"sOBJECTIVE  Pain  is a patient-important outcome , but current reporting in r and omized controlled trials and systematic review s is often suboptimal , impeding clinical interpretation and decision making . METHODS A working group at the  2014 Outcome Measures in Rheumatology ( OMERACT 12 )  was convened to provide guidance for reporting treatment effects regarding   pain   for individual studies and systematic review s. RESULTS For individual trials , authors should report , in addition to mean change , the proportion of patients achieving 1 or more thresholds of improvement from baseline pain ( e.g. , ≥ 20 % , ≥ 30 % , ≥ 50 % ) , achievement of a desirable pain state ( e.g. , no worse than mild pain ) , and /or a combination of change and state . Effects on pain should be accompanied by other patient-important outcomes to facilitate interpretation . When pooling data for meta analysis , authors should consider converting all continuous measures  for pain  to a  100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS )  for  pain  and use the established , minimally important difference ( MID ) of 10 mm , and the conventionally used , appreciably important differences of 20 mm , 30 mm , and 50 mm , to facilitate interpretation . Effects ≤ 0.5 units suggest a small or very small effect . To further increase interpretability , the pooled estimate on  the  VAS should also be transformed to a binary outcome and expressed as a relative risk and risk difference . This transformation can be achieved by calculating the probability of experiencing a treatment effect greater than the MID and the thresholds for appreciably important differences  in  pain reduction in the control and intervention groups .  Presentation of relative effects  regarding  pain will facilitate interpretation of treatment effects."

"nThe use of  human growth hormone  to improve  athletic performance  has recently received worldwide attention . This practice , often called sports doping , is banned by most professional sports leagues and associations , including the International Olympic Committee , Major League Baseball , and the National Football League ( 13 ) . However , a wide range of  athletes , including those from baseball ( 46 ) , cycling ( 7 , 8) , and track and field ( 5 , 9 )  , have been implicated in or have confessed to illicit growth hormone use . The Mitchell report ( 10 ) recently identified  89 Major League Baseball players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs , and some of these players have subsequently admitted to using  growth hormone  ( 11  , 12  )  . Part of the attraction of using  growth hormone  as a performance enhancer has been that its use is difficult to detect . The World Anti-Doping Agency , whose formation stemmed from the widely publicized doping sc and al of the 1998 Tour de France ( 13 ) , first used a  blood test  to  detect exogenous growth hormone  during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens . However , according to the World Anti-Doping Agency , there have been no test-confirmed positive cases for  growth hormone doping  in  professional or Olympic athletes  ( 14 ) , probably because of the limited availability and implementation of this test . Although  growth hormone  is reportedly used to enhance  athletic performance  and has been called the most anabolic substance known ( 15 ) , its  efficacy  for this purpose is not well established . Some have suggested that  growth hormone  is a wonder drug ( 16 ) that results in  ripped muscle  ( 17 ) and provides  stamina-increasing properties  ( 18 ) .  Exogenous growth hormone therapy  in growth hormonedeficient adults ( that is , those with growth hormone deficiency due to hypothalamic or pituitary defects ) results in increased  lean mass and decreased fat mass  ( 19 ) , and comparable  body composition changes  are seen in  healthy elderly adults who receive  growth hormone  (  20 )  .  Some experts , however , have suggested that the  strength-enhancing properties  of  growth hormone  among healthy adults have been exaggerated ( 15 ) . Serious side effects , including  diabetes , hepatitis , and acute renal failure  , may occur in athletes using high-dose growth hormone ( 21 ) . Furthermore , the use of  growth hormone  for athletic enhancement is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and the distribution of growth hormone for this purpose is illegal in the United States ( 22 ) . We performed a systematic review of r and omized , controlled trials to determine the effects of  growth hormone therapy  on  athletic performance  in  healthy , physically fit , young adults .  Our primary aim was to evaluate the  effects  of  growth hormone  on  body composition , strength , basal metabolism , and exercise capacity .  In addition , we sought to synthesize the evidence on adverse events associated with  growth hormone  in the  healthy young  and assess the quality of the published literature . Methods Literature Search es In consultation with 2 research librarians , we developed individual search strategies to identify potentially relevant studies from the MEDLINE , EMBASE , SPORTD iscus , and Cochrane Collaboration data bases . We sought  English- language reports indexed through 11 October 2007  with keywords including growth hormone and r and omized , controlled trial ( Appendix Table 1 ) . We search ed bibliographies of retrieved articles for additional studies . Appendix Table 1 . Search Strategy Study Selection We sought r and omized , controlled trials , including crossover trials , that compared  growth hormone therapy with no growth hormone therapy .   We included studies that 1 ) evaluated at least 5 participants , 2 ) enrolled only community-dwelling participants , 3 ) assessed participants with a mean or median age between 13 and 45 years , and 4 ) provided data on at least 1 clinical outcome of interest .  We  excluded studies that 1 ) focused solely on evaluating growth  hormone secretagogues  , 2 ) explicitly included patients with any comorbid medical condition , or 3 ) evaluated  growth hormone  as treatment for a specific illness ( for example  ,  adult growth hormone deficiency or fibromyalgia ) .  Data Abstract ion One author review ed the titles and abstract s of articles identified through our search and retrieved potentially relevant studies . An endocrinologist and a physician with  training in meta-analytic techniques  separately review ed the retrieved studies and abstract ed data independently onto pretested abstract ion forms . We resolved abstract ion differences by repeated review and consensus . If a study did not present data necessary for analysis or mentioned results but did not present data , we requested additional data from study authors . If data were presented graphically , we used the graph-digitizing program DigitizeIt , version 1.5 ( Share It , Braunschweig , Germany ) , to abstract data from the graph ( 23 ) . If multiple studies presented findings from the same cohort , we used these data only once in our analysis . We abstract ed 4 types of data from each study : participant characteristics ( for example , age , sex , body mass index , baseline maximum oxygen uptake [ VO2max ] ) , study interventions ( for example , dose , route , frequency , and duration of growth  hormone  therapy ) , study quality ( for example , quality of r and omization and blinding ) ( 24 , 25 ) , and clinical outcomes . We included  studies that provided data on at least 1 of  the  following clinical  outcomes :  body composition (  for example ,  body weight , lean body mass , fat mass ) , strength (  for  example  ,  biceps or quadriceps strength ) , basal metabolism (  for  example  ,  resting energy expenditure  ,  basal metabolic rate  ,  heart rate , respiratory exchange ratio  ,  or respiratory quotient ) , exercise capacity  ( for example , exercising lactate levels , exercising respiratory exchange ratio or respiratory quotient , maximum inspiratory pressure , bicycling speed , and VO2max )  , or adverse events .  Because the terms lean body mass and fat-free mass are typically used interchangeably in the literature , we report fat-free mass and lean body mass data as a single category of lean body mass . Similarly , we report  resting  energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate as a single category of basal metabolic rate . Quantitative Data Synthesis To describe key study characteristics , we computed mean values weighted by the number of participants in the trial . To evaluate the effects of growth hormone on  body composition and strength  , we computed a change score for each clinical outcome for both the treatment and control groups as the value of the outcome at trial end minus the value of the outcome at trial start . We used these change scores to calculate the weighted mean difference and st and ard mean difference ( 26 ) effect sizes . The weighted mean difference is reported in the same units as the clinical outcome of interest , thereby facilitating clinical interpretation . Because our outcomes were similar for both methods , we present only the outcomes from the weighted mean difference method . For studies that did not report the  variance  of an outcome at trial end minus the value at trial start , we calculated it as the sum of the trial-start and trial-end variances minus twice the covariance ( 20 , 27 ) . Because trial-start data were not available for most of the studies reporting  basal metabolic outcomes  , we compared trial-end results between treatment and control groups for these outcomes . We combined studies by using r and om-effects models ( 2628 ) because of potential inter study heterogeneity . The considerable variability in exercise protocol s used in the included studies reporting exercise capacity outcomes made pooling these results inappropriate . Instead , we provide a narrative , qualitative assessment of exercise capacity outcomes and report their associated published P values . The variability in reporting adverse events among included studies also made a quantitative meta- analysis of these outcomes inappropriate . Instead , we calculated the proportions  of adverse events  among  participants who received and did  not  receive growth hormone  in studies that reported or evaluated for each adverse event . We performed sensitivity analyses and assessed inter study heterogeneity to evaluate the robustness of our results . We removed each study individually to evaluate that study 's effect on the summary estimates . We assessed  publication bias  by constructing funnel plots and calculated the number of unpublished studies required to statistically significantly change our results ( 28 ) . We assessed  heterogeneity among study results  for each of the summary effects by calculating the  Q statistic ( and associated P value )  and  I 2 statistic  ( 26 , 2830 ) . We evaluated  heterogeneity  through predetermined subgroup analysis that stratified studies by duration of treatment . We performed analyses by using Stata software , version 9.1 ( Stata , College Station , Texas ) ; SPSS , version 15.0 ( SPSS , Chicago ) ; and Comprehensive Meta- Analysis , version 2 ( Biostat , Englewood , New Jersey ) . We considered P values less than 0.05 ( 2-tailed ) to indicate statistically significant differences .

"hA substantial body of credible evidence has accumulated that suggest that  cannabis  use is an important potentially preventable risk factor for the development of psychotic illness and its worse prognosis following the onset of psychosis . Here we summarize the relevant evidence to argue that the time has come to investigate the  neurobiological effects  of  cannabis  in  patients with psychotic disorders .  In the first section we summarize evidence from longitudinal studies that controlled for a range of potential confounders of the association of  cannabis  use with increased  risk of developing psychotic disorders  , increased  risk of hospitalization  ,  frequent and longer hospital stays  , and  failure of treatment with medications  for psychosis in those with established illness . Although some evidence has emerged that cannabis-using and non-using patients with psychotic disorders may have distinct patterns of neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental impairments , the biological underpinnings of the effects of cannabis remain to be fully eluci date d. In the second and third sections we undertake a systematic review of  70 studies , including over 3000 patients with psychotic disorders or at increased risk of psychotic disorder  , in order to delineate potential neurobiological and neurochemical mechanisms that may underlie the effects of  cannabis  in psychotic disorders and suggest avenues for future research."

  Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis  of ≥24 hours may  be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs  in  patients undergoing cardiac surgery  compared to shorter regimens . The findings however are limited by the heterogeneity of antibiotic regimens used and the risk of bias in the published studies.
" There is some evidence that  haloperidol  is an effective treatment for   acute mania  .  From the limited data available , there was no difference in  overall efficacy  of treatment between  haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .  Some evidence suggests that  haloperidol  could be less  effective  than  aripiprazole .  Referring to  tolerability  , when considering the poor evidence comparing drugs , clinicians and patients should consider different side effect profiles as an important issue to inform their choice."
" The current level of evidence for the effectiveness of  vitamin D supplementation  in the management of  people with MS  is based on a single RCT with potential high risk of bias , which does not at present allow confident decision-making about the use of  Vitamin D  in MS . Therefore , until further high quality evidence is available , clinicians may wish to consider relevant MS guidelines on  vitamin D supplementation  when making decisions about the care of  people with  multiple sclerosis . Adequately powered , multi-centred RCTs with a focus on clinical as well as immunological and MRI outcomes that are meaningful to people with MS , and are able to provide insight into the benefits of  Vitamin D  in people with MS , are still required."
",Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder , affecting individuals across the life cycle . Although its etiology is not yet completely understood , genetics plays a substantial role .  Pharmacological treatment  is considered effective and safe for children and adults , but there is considerable inter-individual variability among patients regarding  response to medication , required doses  , and  adverse events .  We present here a systematic review of the literature on ADHD pharmacogenetics to provide a critical discussion of the existent findings , new approaches , limitations , and recommendations for future research . Our main findings are : first , the number of studies continues to grow , making ADHD one of the mental health areas with more pharmacogenetic studies . Second , there has been a focus shift on ADHD pharmacogenetic studies in the last years . There is an increasing number of studies assessing  gene-gene and gene-environment interactions  , using genome-wide association approaches , neuroimaging , and assessing  pharmacokinetic properties .  Third and most importantly , the heterogeneity in method ological strategies employed by different studies remains impressive . The question whether pharmacogenetics studies of ADHD will improve clinical management by shifting from trial- and -error approach to a pharmacological regimen that takes into account the individual variability remains unanswered . © 2014 Wiley Periodicals ,."
" Since the last version of this review , the new included studies have not added high quality evidence to support the use of SSRIs or  venlafaxine  as preventive drugs for migraine . There is no evidence to consider  SSRIs  or  venlafaxine  as more effective than  placebo  or  amitriptyline  in reducing  migraine frequency , intensity , and duration  over two to three months of treatment . No reliable information is available at longer-term follow-up . Our conclusion is that the use of  SSRIs and SNRIs  for migraine prophylaxis is not supported by evidence."
" Method ological problems were revealed in the identified studies , and the gaps in our knowledge about the long-term outcomes of  children  born  after assisted conception  are considerable , including a lack of information on the long-term consequences of ovulation induction . Possible associations with ASD and developmental delay need assessment in larger studies . Studies on assisted conception and CP from countries outside of Sc and inavia are needed , including detailed information on time to pregnancy , underlying cause of infertility , and type of  IVF  treatment."
"gMajor reasons for the insufficient effects of current treatment options in bipolar disorder include delayed intervention for prodromal depressive and manic symptoms and decreased adherence to  psychopharmacological  treatment . The reliance on subjective information and clinical evaluations when diagnosing and assessing the severity of depressive and manic symptoms calls for less biased and more objective markers . By using electronic  devices  , fine-grained data on complex psychopathological aspects of bipolar disorder can be evaluated unobtrusively over the long term . Moreover , electronic data could possibly represent c and i date markers of diagnosis and illness activity in bipolar disorder and allow for early and individualized intervention for prodromal symptoms outside clinical setting s. The present dissertation concerns the use of  electronic monitoring  as a marker and treatment intervention in bipolar disorder and investigated the scientific literature and body of evidence within the area , which includes ten original study reports and two systematic review s , one of which included a meta- analysis , conducted by the author of the dissertation . Taken together , the literature presented in this dissertation illustrates that 1 )  smartphone-based electronic self-monitoring  of mood   seems to reflect clinical ly assessed depressive and manic symptoms and enables the long-term characterization of mood instability in bipolar disorder ; 2 ) preliminary results suggest that  smartphone-based  automatically  generated  data  (  e.g. the  number of text messages sent/day ; the number of incoming and outgoing calls/day ; the number of changes in cell tower IDs/day ; and voice features )  seem to reflect clinical ly assessed depressive and manic symptoms in bipolar disorder ; 3 )  smartphone-based electronic self-monitoring  had no effects on the  severity of depressive and manic symptoms  in bipolar disorder , according to a r and omized controlled trial ; and 4 ) electronic   monitoring  of psychomotor activity and heart rate variability  seems to reflect illness activity in bipolar disorder and differentiate between  patients with bipolar disorder  and healthy control individuals . These findings point toward the usefulness of   electronic monitoring   as a marker of illness in bipolar disorder . Using  electronic monitoring  as a treatment intervention could provide innovative and novel interventions on-dem and with a potential global reach , filling the gap between availability and the need for treatment . However , future studies using rigorous methodology and more r and omized controlled trials that carefully investigate the positive effects and possible harmful effects of  electronic monitoring  in bipolar disorder are needed . In addition , patient  safety , privacy issues , data security  and legal aspects are major concerns that must be considered and addressed when using electronic monitoring."
"nPhysical  activity  is beneficial for many chronic conditions . However , activity levels of  Native Americans  are not well known . This systematic review investigated if  Native American population  s achieve the recommended physical activity levels , compared current and past activity levels , and assessed the ability of  exercise training programmes  to improve  health outcomes  among this population . Electronic data bases ( e.g. MEDLINE , EMBASE ) were search ed and citations were cross-referenced . Included articles reported physical  activity levels or investigations among Native Americans .  This search identified  89 articles :  self-report  ( n = 61 )  ,  accelerometry and  pedometry   (  n = 10  ) ,  metabolic monitoring  ( n = 10 ) and  physical activity interventions  ( n = 17 ) . Few adults were found to meet the  physical activity  recommendations ( 27.2 % [ 95 % confidence interval = 26.9 - 27.5 % ] self-report , 9 % [ 4 - 14 % ] accelerometry ) . Among  children/youth  , 26.5 % ( 24.6 - 28.4 % ) ( self-report ) to 45.7 % ( 42.3 - 49.1 % ) ( pedometry/accelerometry ) met the recommendations .  Adults and children/youth  were generally identified as  physically inactive  ( via doubly labelled water ) . Overall ,  Native American adults  reported  lower activity levels  since 2000 , compared to 1990s , although similar to 1980s . Few  physical activity  interventions employed strong method ologies , large sample sizes and objective outcome measures . There is a clear need to increase  Native American population  s '  physical activity  . Additional research is required to evaluate  exercise training programmes  among this population."
"dCurrent guidelines recommend the use of probiotics to reduce the risk of   eczema .   It remains unclear which strain(s ) to use . We systematic ally evaluated data on the efficacy of  Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) supplementation  prenatally and /or postnatally for the primary prevention of  eczema  . The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , and EMBASE data bases were search ed up to August 2018 , with no language restrictions , for systematic review s of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and RCTs published afterwards . The primary outcome was   eczema  .  For dichotomous outcomes , we calculated the  risk ratio ( RR )  and  95 % confidence interval ( CI )  . A r and om-effects model was used to pool data . Heterogeneity was explored using the I2 statistics . The GRADE criteria were used to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary outcome .  Seven publications reporting 5 RCTs ( 889 participants ) were included .  High to moderate certainty in the body of evidence suggests that  LGG supplementation  ( regardless of the timing of administration ) did  not reduce the risk of eczema .  There was also no consistent effect on  other allergic outcomes .  This meta- analysis shows that  LGG  was  ineffective in reducing eczema .  It does not support the general recommendation to use probiotics for preventing   eczema   , unless specific strains would be indicated."
">There is evidence that  physical exercise training ( PET )  conducted at the workplace is effective in improving  physical fitness  and thus  health .  However , there is no current systematic review available that provides high-level evidence regarding the effects of  PET  on physical fitness in the workforce  .  To quantify sex- , age- , and occupation type-specific effects of  PET  on physical fitness and to characterize dose – response relationships of  PET  modalities that could maximize gains in physical fitness in the  working population .  A computerized systematic literature search was conducted in the data bases PubMed and Cochrane Library ( 2000–2019 ) to identify articles related to   PET  in workers .  Only r and omized controlled trials with a passive control group were included if they investigated the effects of   PET programs   in  workers and tested at  least  one fitness measure  .  Weighted mean st and ardised mean differences ( SMDwm )  were calculated using r and om effects models . A multivariate r and om effects meta-regression was computed to explain the influence of key training modalities ( e.g. , training frequency , session duration , intensity ) on the effectiveness of  PET  on measures of physical fitness . Further , subgroup univariate analyses were computed for each training modality . Additionally , method ological quality of the included studies was rated with the help of the Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) Scale . Overall ,  3423 workers aged 30–56 years participated in 17 studies ( 19 articles ) that were eligible  for inclusion . Method ological quality of the included studies was moderate with a median PEDro score of 6 . Our analyses revealed significant ,  small-sized effects  of PET  on cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) , muscular endurance , and muscle power  ( 0.29 ≤ SMDwm ≤ 0.48 ) . Medium effects were found  for CRF and muscular endurance  in younger workers ( ≤ 45 years ) ( SMDwm = 0.71 ) and white-collar workers ( SMDwm = 0.60 ) , respectively . Multivariate r and om effects meta-regression for CRF revealed that none of the examined training modalities predicted the  effects  of PET  on CRF  ( R2 = 0 ) . Independently computed subgroup analyses showed   significant PET  effects on CRF  when conducted for 9–12 weeks ( SMDwm = 0.31 ) and for 17–20 weeks ( SMDwm = 0.74  )  . PET  effects on physical fitness  in   healthy workers   are moderated by age ( CRF ) and occupation type ( muscular endurance ) . Further , independently computed subgroup analyses indicated that the training period  of the PET  programs may play an important role in  improving CRF  in  workers ."
"sObjectives The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to evaluate  fissure sealant retention in clinical studies in which investigators used  flowable composites  as  pit and fissure sealants compared  with conventional resin-based pit and fissure sealants .  Data sources and data selection The authors conducted a literature search  ( all articles published until April 13 , 2017 )  to identify  studies for inclusion in this systematic review  . They assessed the quality of the evidence provided by using the modified Jadad scale and performed meta-analyses by using a r and om-effects model . Data extraction and data synthesis The authors found  11 studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and nine studies that could be used for the meta- analysis .  Of the 11  studies  identified in the systematic review , four scored as having a low risk of bias , and seven scored as having a medium risk of bias . Our meta- analysis showed a significant positive effect of  using flowable composites  as a fissure sealant material ( odds ratio , 2.387 [ 95 % CI , 1.047 , 5.444 ; P = 0.039 ] ) . Conclusion It seems that the use  of flowable composite as  a fissure sealing  material  can slightly increase the  retention rate of sealants  compared with conventional resin-based sealants."
" Overall , there is no clear established benefit of  VD  supplementation on inflammatory  biomarkers  among  overweight/obese adults .  Baseline serum VD possibly influences the effect of VD repletion on inflammatory markers . Risk of bias was present in most studies , thus supporting the need for higher quality studies in this area to more conclusively underst and the role  VD  supplementation has on inflammatory pathways."
 We found no evidence to support short-term or prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed  formula  compared with exclusive breast feeding for  prevention of allergic disease .  Very low- quality evidence indicates that short-term use of an  EHF  compared with a  CMF  may prevent  infant CMA .  Further trials are recommended before implementation of this practice .We found no evidence to support prolonged feeding with a  hydrolysed formula  compared with a  CMF  for prevention of  allergic disease  in infants unable to be exclusively breast fed.

"sOBJECTIVES to examine and synthesize the available knowledge in the literature about the effects of  preterm birth  on the  development of school-age children .  SOURCES this was a systematic review of studies published in the past ten years indexed in MEDLINE / Pubmed , MEDLINE /BVS ; LILACS /BVS ; IBECS/BVS ; Cochrane/BVS , CINAHL , Web of Science , Scopus , and PsycNET in  three language s ( Portuguese  ,  Spanish , and English )  . Observational  and  experimental studies that assessed  motor development  and /or  behavior  and /or  academic performance  and whose target- population consisted of  preterm children aged 8 to 10 years  were included . Article quality was assessed by the Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology ( STROBE ) and Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) scales ; articles that did not achieve a score of 80 % or more were excluded . SUMMARY OF FINDINGS the  electronic search identified 3,153 articles , of which 33 were included based on the eligibility criteria .  Only four studies found no  effect of prematurity  on the outcomes ( two articles on behavior , one on  motor performance  and one on  academic performance )  . Among the outcomes of interest ,  behavior  was the most search ed ( 20 articles , 61 % ) , followed by  academic performance  ( 16 articles , 48 % ) and  motor impairment  ( 11 articles , 33 % ) .   premature infants  are more susceptible to  motor development , behavior and academic performance impairment  when compared to  term infants  . These types of impairments , whose effects are manifested in the long term , can be prevented through early parental guidance , monitoring by specialized professionals , and interventions."
"nAbstract  Anemia  is the most frequent complication of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , but anemia , mostly due to iron deficiency , has long been neglected in these patients . The aim was to briefly present the pathophysiology , followed by a balanced overview of the different forms of  iron replacement available  , and subsequently , to perform a systematic review of studies performed in the last decade on the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in IBD . Given that  intravenous therapies  have been introduced in the last decade , a systematic review performed in PubMed , EMBASE , the Cochrane Library , and the websites of WHO , FDA , and EMA covered prospect i ve trials investigating the management of  iron-deficiency anemia in  IBD published since 2004 .  A total of 632 articles were review ed , and 13 articles ( 2906 patients ) with unique content were included .  In general ,  oral supplementation in iron-deficiency  anemia   should be administered with a target to restore/replenish the  iron stores  and the  hemoglobin level  in a suitable way . However , in  patients with IBD flares and inadequate responses to or side  effects  with oral preparations  ,  intravenous iron supplementation  is the therapy of choice . Neither oral nor intravenous therapy seems to exacerbate the  clinical course of IBD  , and intravenous  iron  therapy can be administered even in active disease stages and concomitantly with biologics . In conclusion , because many physicians are in doubt as to how to manage  anemia and iron deficiency   in  IBD , there is a clear need for the implementation of evidence -based recommendations on this matter . Based on the data presented ,  oral iron therapy  should be preferred for  patients with quiescent disease stages  and trivial iron  deficiency   anemia  unless such patients are intolerant or have an inadequate response , whereas intravenous  iron  supplementation may be of advantage in patients with aggravated anemia or flares of IBD because inflammation hampers intestinal absorption of iron."
">ABSTRACT While growing evidence suggests that  microfinance  is an effective approach for improved women  ’s health  , a significant gap remains in our underst and ing . The objective of this review is to synthesis e the findings from published literature focused on microfinance and health issues particularly affecting  women  , including HIV/AIDS , reproductive health , mental health , and violence .  Forty-one articles that examine the impact of  microfinance participation  on women ’s health were identified through a systematic search of electronic data  bases , coded using a structured abstract ion form , and synthesis ed . Review results indicate that the impact  of  microfinance   on  women  ’s  health  is an area in great need of research and publication attention . Varied quality and reporting in the identified articles restricted the ability to draw concrete conclusions regarding the relationship between  microfinance  participation and women ’s health , but led to the identification of current gaps in existing published research . Future research should work to address the recommendations provided in order to offer additional evidence to better underst and the use of  microfinance programming  as a structural intervention to improve women  ’s  health  ."

"eOBJECTIVES The first aim was to make an inventory of available instruments and  question naires  for the assessment of   disabilities   in  personal care in patients with rheumatic disorders .  The second aim was to investigate which of these instruments have acceptable , method ological quality with regard to reliability , validity and responsiveness . The third aim was to investigate the assumption that convergent validity results in stronger correlations when vali date d against a more similar construct . METHODS A computer-aided literature search ( 1982  - 2001  ) in several data bases was performed to identify studies focusing on the clinimetric properties of instruments to assess impairments in function in  patients with rheumatic disorders .  Data were extracted in a st and ardised way and compared to a priori defined criteria . RESULTS In total ,  19 measurement instruments were  included . Five out of these 19 were found to have acceptable  reliability  , while 12 had  acceptable validity .  Only three question naires met both criteria . Results concerning the  responsiveness  of these three question naires were conflicting . No difference was found in the strength of correlation between validation against the most similar construct versus validation against the least similar construct .  It is concluded that the  Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale ( AIMS )  is the most suitable instrument for the assessment of  disabilities  in personal care."

"nAtrial  fibrillation ( AF )  is highly  prevalent in older adults  and has been associated with increased  morbidity and mortality  . To reduce this AF-related morbidity in older adults ,  antiarrhythmic drugs ( AADs )  are regularly used for rhythm control , assuming that increasing time in sinus rhythm reduces AF-related morbidity . However , whether AADs can improve clinical outcomes in older adults remains unclear because of the increased risk for  adverse drug  events compared with rate control . The aim of this study was to determine the impact of  rhythm control  versus  rate control  on clinical outcomes in  older adults with AF .  We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis targeting  patients aged ≥65 years with AF and using  drugs to control rate or rhythm .   Articles that met the following criteria were included :  enrolled older patients ( sample mean ≥75 years ) with AF  , compared pharmacological rate versus rhythm control , and  reported all-cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , or ischemic stroke  . Five observational studies were included . In total ,  86,926 patients with AF with a mean age ranging from 75 to 92 years were studied  . No differences were found between rhythm and rate control  for all-cause mortality  ( odds ratio [ OR ] 1.11 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.78–1.59 ; I2 = 79.6 % ; n = 28,526 ; four studies )  and cardiovascular mortality  ( OR 1.09 ; 95 % CI 0.81–1.47 ; I2 = 0 % ; n = 2292 ; two studies ) . Rhythm control result ed in  fewer strokes  ( OR 0.86 ; 95 % CI 0.80–0.93 ; I2 = 0 % ; n = 59,496 ) , although this was mainly determined by one study . All collected data were observational , which precluded making strong recommendations . Furthermore , all CIs were wide , increasing the uncertainty of the observed effects . As such , evidence was insufficient to recommend rhythm or rate control as the first-line therapy for AF in  older adults  . As AF is particularly prevalent in  older people  , more r and omized controlled trials are needed in this population."
"rIn developing countries , deficiencies of micronutrients are thought to have a major impact on child development ; however , a consensus on the specific relationship between  dietary zinc  intake and  cognitive function  remains elusive . The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relationship between   zinc  intake , status and indices of cognitive  function  in children and adults .  A systematic literature search was conducted using EMBASE , MEDLINE and Cochrane Library data bases from inception to March 2014 . Included studies were  those that  supplied zinc as supplements  or  measured dietary zinc intake .   A meta- analysis of the extracted data was performed where sufficient data were available .  Of all of the potentially relevant papers , 18 studies met the inclusion criteria , 12 of which were r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ; 11 in children and 1 in adults ) and 6 were observational studies ( 2 in children and 4 in adults ) .  Nine of the 18 studies reported a positive association  between zinc intake or status with one or more measure of cognitive function .  Meta- analysis of data from the adult ’s studies was not possible because of limited number of studies . A meta- analysis of data from the six RCTs conducted in children revealed that there was no significant overall  effect of zinc intake on any indices of cognitive function : intelligence , st and ard  mean difference of < 0.001 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) –0.12 , 0.13 ) P=0.95  ; executive function , st and ard  mean difference of 0.08 ( 95 % CI , –0.06 , 022 ) P=0.26  ; and motor skills st  and ard mean difference of 0.11 ( 95 % CI –0.17 , 0.39 ) P=0.43 . Heterogeneity in the study design s was a major limitation , hence only a small number ( n=6 ) of studies could be included in the meta-analyses . Meta- analysis failed to show a significant  effect of  zinc  supplementation on cognitive  functioning  in children  though , taken as a whole , there were some small indicators of improvement  on aspects of executive function and motor development  following supplementation but high- quality RCTs are necessary to investigate this further."
"oDespite intensified efforts by the European Council since 2003 , the implementation of  organized , population -based mammography screening  is not uniform across Europe and depends greatly on the policies in place in different countries , the organization of health care , and available re sources ( 1 ) . Since the last edition of the European Guidelines on Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis was published in 2006 ( 2 ) , new evidence regarding breast cancer and innovation in guideline methodology prompted the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer ( ECIBC ) to develop new evidence -based recommendations ( in short , the European Breast Guidelines ) . This article provides a synopsis of 15 key recommendations selected from the European Breast Guidelines , coordinated by the European Commission 's Joint Research Centre and developed by an international guideline development group ( GDG ) . These guidelines inform women , health professionals , and policymakers about important questions related to organized mammography screening and breast cancer diagnosis , but recommendations may apply in context s in which organized screening programs are not in place . The recommendations primarily address  women at average risk for breast cancer without increased risk due to genetic predisposition ( mutations  in BRCA1  and  BRCA2  )  , reproductive history , or race/ethnicity . However ,  women with a family history  , who may  have a higher-than-average risk  , are included in the ECIBC recommendations . Some recommendations also focus on women with high  breast density  and  suspicious lesions  on screening . The corresponding evidence review s and recommendations are kept up to date and are available for adoption and adaptation at https://ecibc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ recommendations . Guideline Development and Review Process The European Commission adheres to methods for producing trustworthy guidelines ( 36 ) , which we described in detail previously ( 7 ) . In brief , the European Commission authorized new systematic review s , or syntheses of existing ones , up to March 2016 for earlier recommendations and to December 2018 for later , more recent recommendations . This evidence informed the criteria in the  GRADE ( Grading of  Recommendations  Assessment , Development and Evaluation )  Evidence to Decision ( EtD ) frameworks that the GDG , guided by 4 cochairs and vice chairs , used to develop the recommendations ( 710 ) . Each recommendation is linked to the full online EtD containing references , explanations ( including considerations for implementation , monitoring , and research priorities ) , and judgments that were developed with GRADE 's official app GRADE pro ( www . grade pro.org ) ( 7 ) . Recommendations The Supplement Table lists all 40 questions and recommendations addressed by the group as of May 2019 ; the first 15 recommendations listed in the table are those addressed in this synopsis . The table includes the strength ( strong or conditional ) and certainty-of- evidence ratings and the date s of the last pertinent literature search es . The GDG took a programmatic population perspective , suggesting that strong recommendations in this context may be adopted as policies in most situations ( 11 ) . Conditional recommendations suggest that policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders . The implication s of the recommendations for women and clinicians are supported by more specific , linked recommendations focusing on communication and shared  decision making .  Should  Organized Mammography Screening  in  Women  Be Used ? The GDG considered  women in the following age groups : 40 to 44 , 45 to 49 , 50 to 69 , and 70 to 74 years .  Evidence from some systematic review s applied to all age groups for 1 or more EtD criteria . For example ,  mammography screening  does not seem to create  anxiety  in women who are given a clear result after a mammogram . However , women recalled for further testing reported  transient or long-term anxiety  ( from 6 months to 3 years after recall ) , but this was not consistent across studies ( 1214 ) . Women generally consider these undesirable effects acceptable ( low certainty of evidence ) , and a systematic review suggested that women place a relatively low value on the  psychosocial and physical effects  of  false-positive results  and  overdiagnosis ;  however , some studies raised concerns about whether women fully underst and the result ing implication s ( 15 ) .  Organized Mammography Screening  in  Women Aged 40 to 44 Years or 45 to  49  Years  Recommendation 1 . For  asymptomatic women aged 40 to 44 years  with an  average risk  for  breast cancer  , the ECIBC 's GDG suggests not implementing  organized mammography screening  ( conditional recommendation , moderate certainty of evidence ; EtD available at http://bit.ly/2pf8l9 M ) . Recommendation 2 . For asymptomatic  women aged  45 to 49 years with an average risk for breast cancer , the ECIBC 's GDG suggests  mammography screening  over  no mammography screening  , in the context of an organized screening program ( conditional recommendation , moderate certainty of evidence ; EtD available at http://bit.ly/2Pn1HZx ) . Eight r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of invitation to  mammography screening  provided  breast cancer mortality data  from  348478 women younger than 50 years  ( 1622 ) , and 4 review s of observational studies evaluated relevant outcomes ( 1214 , 23 ) .  Organized mammography screening  probably reduces  breast cancer mortality  ( 1622 ) and may reduce the  risk for breast cancer stage  IIA or higher ( 17 , 18 , 22 , 2428 ) . The incidence of breast cancer and mortality increases with age , and the GDG extrapolated that the absolute health benefits are greater in  women aged 45 to 49 than those aged 40 to 44 years .  Data from  5 available trials in women aged 40 to 74 years  suggest an increase in the  rate of  mastectomy   ( 19 , 2932 ) , although the GDG was concerned that these results might be misleading because of lead time . One RCT suggests a rate of 12.4 % ( 95 % CI , 9.9 % to 14.9 % ) to 22.7 % ( CI , 18.4 % to 27.0 % ) for  overdiagnosis  , depending on whether a population or an individual woman perspective is taken ( 27 ) . The number of  false-positives  depends on the age of first screening , and women aged 40 to 44 years also have a greater  radiation risk  than older women . The balance of desirable versus undesirable health effects for starting screening at age 40 probably favors no screening ( the GDG judged that the undesirable health effects are large and the desirable ones small ) . However , for the  45- to 49-year age group  , the higher  breast cancer incidence  and  mortality  compared with  women  between the ages of 40 and 44 , as well as observational evidence showing a greater benefit in this age group ( 33 ) , led the GDG to judge that the balance of health effects probably favors screening , although the required re sources for screening likely differ across setting s ( 34 , 35 ) .  Organized  Mammography Screening  in Women Aged 50 to 69 Years  Recommendation 3 . For asymptomatic  women aged 50 to 69 years  with an average risk for  breast cancer  , the ECIBC 's GDG recommends  mammography screening  over  no mammography screening  , in the context of an organized screening program ( strong recommendation , moderate certainty of evidence ; EtD available at http://bit.ly/2qNKE91 ) . On the basis of data from  249930 women aged 50 to 69 years from 6 RCTs  , invitation to organized  mammography screening  reduces  breast cancer mortality  ( 17 , 1922 , 36 ) and may reduce  the risk for breast cancer stage IIA or higher  ( 17 , 22 , 2426 , 37 ) . Five trials describe increased  rates of mastectomy  in women between ages 40 and 74 ( 19 , 2932 ) , with concerns about lead-time bias similar to those for the younger  age  group . Pooled estimates from 2 RCTs suggest  overdiagnosis rates  of 10.1 % ( CI , 8.6 % to 11.6 % ) and 17.3 % ( CI , 14.7 % to 20.0 % ) ( 37 , 38 ) . The  cost-effectiveness studies  probably favored screening , but this would vary across countries ( 34 , 3941 ) . The GDG determined that screening in this age group has a  net health benefit  , and other EtD criteria were generally in favor of implementing organized  mammography screening .  Thus , despite uncertainty about the relative importance of outcomes or values , the GDG made a strong recommendation for organized  screening  but emphasizes that all  invited women  should receive clear information about the desirable and undesirable effects to make informed decisions .  Organized Mammography Screening  in  Women Aged 70 to 74  Years Recommendation 4 . For  asymptomatic women aged 70 to 74 years with an average risk for breast cancer  , the ECIBC 's GDG suggests  mammography screening  over  no mammography screening  , in the context of an organized screening program ( conditional recommendation , moderate certainty of evidence ; EtD available at http://bit.ly/31KjCMA ) . According to 2 RCTs  of invitation to  mammography screening  in 18233 women aged 70 years and older  ( 19 , 21 ) ,  organized mammography screening  reduces  breast cancer mortality , the risk for breast cancer stage IIA or higher  , and  detection of tumors larger than 50 mm  ( 25 ) . Five trials in  women aged 40 to  74 years described increased  mastectomy rates  ( 19 , 2932 ) . Concerns have been raised about lead-time bias , the small number of women aged 70 to 74 years included for the outcome of mastectomy , and the available data for overdiagnosis being derived exclusively from women aged 50 to 69 years for an overall judgment of probable net health benefit . Other EtD criteria also were generally in favor of implementing organized  mammography screening  in this age group . How Often Should Women Attend an  Organized  Mammography  Screening Program  ? Women Aged 45 to 49 Years Recommendation 5 . For  asymptomatic women aged 45 to  49  years  with an average risk for breast cancer , the ECIBC 's GDG suggests either biennial or triennial  mammography over annual screening  in the context of an organized  screening  program ( conditional recommendation , very low certainty of evidence ; EtD available at http://bit.ly/32O1faP ) . Women Aged 50 to 69 Years Recommendations 6 and 7 . For  asymptomatic women aged 50  to."

"sOBJECTIVES  Orthostatic hypotension  is a common condition among  older adults  and is associated with a range of deleterious outcomes . Recently , interest has developed in hypovitaminosis D ( defined as low 25 hydroxiyvitamin D levels ) as a potential risk factor for orthostatic  hypotension  . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis examining the association of orthostatic  hypotension  between  study participants with and without hypovitaminosis D  , including the adjustment of potential confounders ( age , sex , BMI , renal function , comorbidities , seasonality , use of antihypertensive medications , and supplementation with  cholecalciferol )  . METHODS A systematic literature search of major electronic data bases from inception until 09/2015 was made for articles providing data on orthostatic hypotension and hypovitaminosis D. A r and om effects meta- analysis of cross-sectional studies investigating  orthostatic hypotension  prevalence comparing  participants with  vs.  those without hypovitaminosis D  was undertaken , calculating the odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) . RESULTS Of  317 initial hits , five cross-sectional studies were meta-analysed including 3646 participants ( 1270 with hypovitaminosis D and 2376 without ) . The participants with hypovitaminosis D  had a higher prevalence of  orthostatic hypotension  ( OR = 1.88 ; 95 % CI : 1.25 - 2.84 ; I = 68 % ) that was not affected by adjusting for a median of five potential confounders ( OR = 2.03 ; 95 % CI : 1.13 - 3.68 ; I = 73 % ) .  People with  orthostatic hypotension   had significantly reduced  serum vitamin D concentrations  ( st and ardized mean difference = -0.42 ; 95 % CI : -0.72 to -0.12 ) . One longitudinal study confirmed the association between hypovitaminosis D and  orthostatic hypotension .   Our meta- analysis highlights that hypovitaminosis D is associated with  orthostatic hypotension  , independent of potential confounders . Further longitudinal studies and clinical trials are required to confirm these findings."
"yPURPOSE To systematic ally identify and review the currently available evidence on the  long-term  outcomes of recommended attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) interventions following r and omized controlled trials with  children and young people .  METHOD A systematic search was conducted to identify  trials > 1 year in length  using the following data bases : CINAHL ( January  1982-  July 2012 ) , MEDLINE ( Ovid and Cambridge Scientific Abstract s [ CSA ] ) , Psych info , Science Direct ( Elsevier ) , and Cochrane Library . H and search es of key journals in the subject , book chapters , and conference proceedings were also carried out . Relevant papers were critically appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool . RESULTS Eight controlled trials were identified as being relevant , of duration ranging from 1 year to 8 years ( at follow up ) . The  total number of participants in the studies was 1,057 , of whom 579 ( 54.7 % ) were from one cohort and included 26 different outcome measures .  Results suggest there is moderate-to-high-level evidence that  combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions , and pharmacological interventions alone  can be  effective  in  managing the core ADHD symptoms and academic performance  at 14 months . However , the  effect size  may decrease beyond this period .  This review has highlighted the paucity and limitations of the evidence investigating the long-term outcomes of recommended interventions for managing ADHD symptoms . There is little evidence to suggest that the effects observed over the relatively short term are maintained throughout longer periods of impairment . Furthermore , much of the existing evidence examining effectiveness beyond 12 months does not include newer medications currently available or consider significant context ual and cultural differences , such as UK/European and Asian population s. Longitudinal studies are required to examine the  long-term outcomes  for  children and young people with ADHD  managed with currently recommended service interventions . They should also include the whole spectrum of ADHD , with its full range of coexisting conditions , and cultural and context ual diversity."
"gAim The increasing rate of all-cause dementia worldwide and the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatments emphasise the value of lifestyle approaches as prevention strategies . Emerging evidence suggests sedentary behaviour is associated with  impaired cognitive function .  A better underst and ing of this association would significantly add to our knowledge of how to best promote  healthy cognitive ageing .  Thus , we conducted a systematic review ascertaining the contribution of  sedentary behaviour  towards associated changes in  cognitive function  over the  adult  lifespan . Study design Systematic review of peer- review ed literature examining the association of  sedentary behaviour  with  cognition .  Data sources We search ed PubMed , PsycINFO , EBSCO and Web of Science , and reference lists of relevant review s on sedentary  behaviour  . Two independent review ers extracted ( 1 ) study characteristics and ( 2 ) information regarding measurement of  sedentary behaviour and cognitive function .  We also assessed study quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) checklist . Eligibility criteria We limited search results to  adults ≥40 years , observational studies published in English since 1990 and studies investigating associations between  sedentary behaviour  and  cognitive function .   Results  8 studies  examined the association  of  sedentary behaviour with cognitive function  .  6 studies reported significant negative associations  between sedentary behaviour and cognitive function .  8 different  measures of sedentary behaviour  and  13 different measures of cognitive function  were used across all eight studies . Summary Sedentary behaviour is associated with lower  cognitive performance  , although the attributable risk of sedentary time to all-cause dementia incidence is unclear . Our systematic review provides evidence that limiting sedentary time and concomitantly engaging in regular  moderate-to-vigorous  physical activity may best promote healthy cognitive ageing."
" Most studies revealed a positive association between mastication and  obesity among adults .

"gBACKGROUND Despite the burden of schizophrenia and  bipolar disorder  in the  Chinese population  , country-specific data to guide practitioners regarding antipsychotic therapy are lacking . The primary aim of this systematic review was to examine evidence of the  efficacy , effectiveness , and safety  of  olanzapine  in  Chinese population s.  METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using data bases covering  international and Chinese core journals  using search terms related to  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  ,  specified countries ( People 's Republic of China , Hong Kong , Taiwan )  , and  olanzapine  treatment . Following initial screening , inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the search results to identify relevant studies from which data were extracted . RESULTS  A total of 489 publications were retrieved and 61 studies were identified for inclusion .  Most studies were related to  schizophrenia ( n=54 )  , with six studies related to bipolar disorder and one  study  related to  both  conditions . The quality of study methods and reporting in international journals was noticeably better than in Chinese language journals . Most studies included  relatively small patient population s  and were  of short duration .  The  efficacy  of olanzapine in Chinese  population  s was confirmed by multiple comparative and noncomparative studies that found statistically significant  reductions in symptom measures  in studies conducted for ≥6 weeks ( schizophrenia ) or ≥3 weeks ( bipolar disorder ) . Findings related  to effectiveness ( treatment discontinuation , quality of life , and neurocognitive improvements )  were generally consistent with those observed in non-Chinese population s. No new safety signals specific for Chinese population s were raised  for  olanzapine .   Chinese and non-Chinese population s with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder  treated  with olanzapine  display broadly similar responses . Differences between these population s , especially in relation to the relative efficacy of olanzapine versus other antipsychotics , may warrant further investigation via studies incorporating both population s. Use of local data to provide evidence for practice guidelines should be encouraged , and may promote ongoing improvements in the quality of research and study reporting."

"5OBJECTIVE  Iron supplementation  in iron-deficiency anaemia is st and ard practice , but the benefits of  iron supplementation  in  iron-deficient non-anaemic ( IDNA ) individuals  remains controversial . Our objective is to identify the effects of  iron therapy  on  fatigue and physical capacity  in  IDNA adults .  DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) . SETTING Primary care . PARTICIPANTS  Adults ( ≥18 years ) who were iron deficient but non-anaemic .  INTERVENTIONS  Oral , intramuscular or intravenous iron supplementation ;  all therapy doses , frequencies and duration s were included . COMPARATORS  Placebo  or  active therapy .  RESULTS We identified RCTs in Medline , Embase , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health , SportD iscus and CAB Abstract s from inception to 31 October 2016 . We search ed the WHO 's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for relevant ongoing trials and performed forward search es of included trials and relevant review s in Web of Science . We assessed internal validity of included trials using the  Cochrane Risk of  Bias  tool  and the external validity using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation methodology . From 11 580 citations , we included 18 unique trials and  2  companion papers  enrolling 1170 patients .  Using a Mantel-Haenszel r and om-effects model  , iron supplementation  was associated with  reduced self-reported fatigue  ( st and ardised mean difference ( SMD ) -0.38 ; 95 % CI -0.52 to -0.23 ; I2 0 % ; 4 trials ; 714 participants ) but was not associated with differences in objective measures of physical capacity ,  including maximal oxygen consumption  ( SMD 0.11 ; 95 % CI -0.15 to 0.37 ; I2 0 % ; 9 trials ; 235 participants ) and timed methods of exercise testing  .  Iron supplementation significantly  increased serum haemoglobin concentration  ( MD 4.01 g/L ; 95 % CI 1.22 to 6.81 ; I2 48 % ; 12 trials ; 298  participants ) and serum ferritin  ( MD 9.23 µmol/L ; 95 % CI 6.48 to 11.97 ; I2 58 % ; 14 trials ; 616 participants ) .  In  IDNA adults   ,  iron supplementation is associated with  reduced  subjective measures  of fatigue  but not with objective improvements in physical capacity . Given the global prevalence of both iron deficiency and fatigue , patients and practitioners could consider consumption  of iron-rich foods or iron  supplementation to improve symptoms of fatigue in the absence of documented anaemia .

" AND RELEVANCE In a broad review of published literature , risk factors for SSI were characterized as describing reduced fitness , patient frailty , surgery duration , and complexity . Recognition of risk factors frequently associated with SSI allows for identification of such patients with the greatest need for optimal preventive measures to be identified and pre-treatment prior to surgery."
 Our results suggest a high  rate of lifetime concurrent anxiety disorders  in bipolar disorder . The diagnostic issues at the interface are particularly difficult because of the substantial symptom overlap . The treatment of co-existing conditions has clinical ly remained challenging.
"sBackground  Oral iron supplementation  is used widely in  older people  despite observational studies suggesting it is ineffective . Objective The aim of this systematic review was to determine if  oral iron therapy  is effective in  elderly people with iron deficiency anaemia .  Data Sources MEDLINE , EMBASE and The Cochrane Library data bases were search ed from inception to 23 January 2014 . Study Selection  R and omised controlled  trials comparing  oral iron with no iron supplementation or placebo  and measuring the change in haemoglobin levels in  elderly patients with anaemia  were included . Titles and abstract s were review ed and publications were screened by both authors independently to exclude articles that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria . Study Appraisal and Synthesis Risk of bias was systematic ally assessed independently by both authors using the Cochrane risk of bias tool . Data on the increase  in haemoglobin level  after therapy was either collected from original publications or by contacting the corresponding authors .  Length of hospitalisation , mortality and adverse effect data  were also analysed . Results  A total of 6,163 citations were screened  ,  but only three studies ( a total of 440 participants with a mean age ranging between 70 and 83 years ) met the inclusion criteria .  Meta- analysis showed  oral iron supplementation   increased haemoglobin levels  more than placebo or no treatment after 4–6 weeks of treatment ( mean difference 0.35 g/dL , 95 % CI 0.12–0.59 , p = 0.003 ) . There were no statistically significant differences  in adverse effects , length of hospitalisation or mortality .  Limitations Only one of the three studies was specific  to older people  and all studies  involved patients in orthopaedic setting  s.  The mean age of participants was different  , and the dosage and frequency of ferrous sulphate differed . Conclusion  Oral iron  raises  haemoglobin levels  in  elderly people with iron deficiency anaemia  by 0.35 g/dL after 4–6 weeks , but it is unclear if this results in tangible health benefits."
"dDespite the popularity of the  PTSD Checklist ( PCL )  as a clinical screening test , there has been no comprehensive quality review of studies evaluating its diagnostic accuracy . A systematic quality assessment of  22 diagnostic accuracy studies of the English- language  PCL   using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS ) assessment tool was conducted to examine ( a ) the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies of the  PCL  , and ( b ) whether quality has improved since the 2003 ST And ards for the Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy studies ( STARD ) initiative regarding reporting guidelines for diagnostic accuracy studies . Three raters independently applied the QUADAS tool to each study , and a consensus among the 4 authors is reported . Findings indicated that although studies generally met st and ards in several quality areas , there is still room for improvement . Areas for improvement include establishing representativeness , adequately describing clinical and demographic characteristics of the sample , and presenting better descriptions of  important aspects  of test  and reference  st and  ard  execution . Only 2 studies met each of the 14 quality criteria . In addition , study quality has not appreciably improved since the publication of the STARD Statement in 2003 . Recommendations for the improvement of  diagnostic accuracy studies of  the  PCL  are discussed."
" The evidence ( rated as low quality ) suggested that  moderate-  and moderate- to  high-intensity resistance training  improves  multidimensional function , pain , tenderness , and muscle strength  in  women with fibromyalgia .  The evidence ( rated as low quality ) also suggested that eight weeks of  aerobic exercise  was superior to  moderate-intensity resistance training  for improving  pain  in  women with fibromyalgia .  There was low- quality evidence that 12 weeks of  low-intensity resistance training  was superior to  flexibility exercise training  in  women with fibromyalgia  for  improvements in pain and multidimensional function .  There was low- quality evidence that  women with fibromyalgia  can safely perform moderate- to high-resistance training."
"1Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of  exercise and physical activity ( PA ) promotion  on  cardiovascular fitness , muscle strength , flexibility , neuromotor performance ( eg  ,  balance )  and  daily PA  in  people with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) and hip/knee osteoarthritis ( HOA/KOA ) .  Methods systematic review ( SR ) and meta- analysis ( MA ) were performed search ing the data bases PubMed / Medline , CENTRAL , Embase , Web of Science , Emcare and PsycInfo until April 2017 . We included r and omised controlled trials (  RCTs ) in adults ( ≥18 years ) with RA , SpA and HOA/KOA  , investigating the effects  of exercise or PA promotion  according to the public health PA recommendations by the American College of Sports Medicine . The time point of interest was the first assessment after the intervention period . If suitable , data were pooled in a MA using a r and om-effects model presented as st and ardised mean difference ( SMD ) . Results The SR included 63 RCTs , of which  49 ( 3909 people with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA ) were included  in the MA . Moderate effects were found of  aerobic exercises and resistance training on cardiovascular fitness  ( SMD 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.38 to 0.75  ) ) and muscle strength  ( SMD 0.54 ( 95 % CI 0.35 to 0.72 ) ) , respectively , but no effect of  combined  strength/aerobic/flexibility  exercises on  flexibility ( SMD 0.12 ( 95 % CI -0.16 to  0.41 ) ) . PA  promotion  interventions produced a small increase in PA behaviour  ( SMD 0.21 ( 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.38 )  ) . Conclusion Exercises and PA promotion  according  to  public health recommendations   for  PA improved cardiovascular fitness , muscle strength and PA behaviour  , with moderate effect sizes  in people with SpA , RA and HOA/KOA .

">Hypertensive emergencies occur when  high blood pressure  is associated with the presence of acute end-organ damage , such as hypertensive encephalopathy . There is controversy as to when and which antihypertensive drugs to use in these situations . Using a comprehensive search strategy in electronic sources , MEDLINE , EMBASE and Cochrane clinical trial register , we conducted a systematic review to look all r and omized control trials ( RCTs ) that compare an  antihypertensive drug  versus  placebo , no treatment  or  another antihypertensive drug .   Fifteen RCTs ( representing 869 patients ) met the inclusion criteria .  Two trials included a  placebo  arm . All studies ( except one ) were open-label trials . Seven drug classes were evaluated in those trials :  nitrates  ( nine trials ) ,  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  ( seven ) ,  diuretics  ( three )  , calcium channel blockers  ( six ) ,  α-1 adrenergic antagonists  ( four ) ,  direct vasodilators  ( two ) and  dopamine agonists  (  one ) . Mortality event data  were reported in seven trials . Due to insufficient data , no meta- analysis was performed for clinical  outcomes . Differences in blood pressure  changes between antihypertensives were minor . There is no RCT evidence demonstrating that antihypertensive drugs  reduce mortality or morbidity  in  patients with hypertensive emergencies .  Furthermore , there is insufficient RCT evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in  reducing mortality and morbidity .  There were some minor differences in the  degree of blood pressure lowering  when one class of antihypertensive drug is compared to another . However , the clinical significance is unknown . RCTs are needed to assess different drug classes to determine initial and longer-term  mortality and morbidity outcomes ."
"sWe conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of  twenty-eight US-based studies applying the findings of the Diabetes Prevention Program , a clinical trial that  tested the  effects  of  a  lifestyle intervention  for people at high risk for diabetes  , in  real-world setting  s. The  average weight change  at twelve months after the intervention was a loss of about 4 percent from participants ' baseline weight  . Change in weight  was similar regardless of whether the intervention was delivered by clinical ly trained professionals or lay educators . Additional analyses limited to seventeen  studies  with a nine-month or greater follow-up assessment showed similar  weight change .  With every additional lifestyle session attended ,  weight loss  increased by 0.26 percentage point . We conclude that costs associated with diabetes prevention can be lowered without sacrificing effectiveness , using nonmedical personnel and motivating higher attendance at program sessions."
")Our systematic review in BMC Psychiatry concluded that  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs )  compared with  placebo  significantly increase the risk of  serious adverse events  ( SAEs ) in  patients with major depression  and the potential beneficial effects of SSRIs seem to be outweighed by the harms . Hieronymus et al. accused us of method ological inaccuracies and blatant errors . In their post-hoc analysis of our data , they reported that SSRIs only increase the risk of SAEs in elderly and seems safe for  non-elderly patients .  They also found our review misleading because our efficacy analyses were based on the  17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ;  we included suboptimal SSRI doses ; and we missed some ' pivotal trials ' . We do not agree with Hieronymus et al. regarding several of the ' errors ' they cl aim that we have made . However , we acknowledge that they have identified minor errors and that we missed some trials . After rectifying the errors and inclusion of the missed trials by us and Hieronymus et al. , we re-analysed the data . The up date d analyses are even more robust and confirm our earlier conclusions . SSRIs significantly increase  the risk of an SAE  both in  non-elderly  ( p=0.045 )  and elderly  ( p=0.01  ) patients  [ overall odds ratio 1.39 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.13 to 1.73 ; p=0.002 ; I2=0 % ] . Moreover , SSRIs did not change noticeably the  17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  , the internationally accepted scale ( mean difference -2.02 points ; 95 % CI -2.38 to -1.66 ; p<0.00001 ) . We found no differential effect of dose ( p=0.20 )."
"9BACKGROUND There has an increasing number of published trials on  psychosocial intervention programmes  for  pre-school children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) .  To achieve better quality of unbiased evidence for the effectiveness of ASD interventions , it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review that covers studies with adequate quality st and ards , such as r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) , and different types of intervention In this study , we categorize interventions for ASD as  behavioural , social-communication focused , and multimodal developmental  based on Howlin 's classification of early interventions for  children with ASD .  The aim of this study was to compare these three models and investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each type of intervention and to identify the approaches that contribute to a successful outcome for  children with autism .  METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis . We included RCTs targeting  children with ASD 6 years old or younger .  A r and om effects model was used to present the effect estimate for the outcomes . This study also performed combined meta-analyses of all the three models to investigate the overall effectiveness of the intervention programmes . RESULTS  32 r and omized controlled studies  were found to be eligible for inclusion . The synthesized data included  594 children from 14 RCTs .  There was no statistically significant difference in the  effects on autism general symptoms  between the social-communication-focused model and the multimodal  developmental model  ( p = 0.83 ) . The results suggest that there is evidence of an effect  on ' reciprocity of social interaction towards others '  ( st and ard mean difference [ 95 % confidential interval ] = 0.53[0.29,0.78 ] , p<0.01 ) and  ' parental synchrony '  ( SMD = 0.99[0.70,1.29 ] , p<0.01 ) .  The small number of studies included in the present study limited the ability to make inferences when comparing the three models and investigating the strengths and weaknesses of each type of intervention with respect to important outcomes . Since the outcome of  ' reciprocity of social interaction towards others '  could be a dependent variable that might be context -bound to interactions with the child 's parent , we can not conclude the interventions for  pre-school children with ASD  have significant effects on a generalized skill to engage in reciprocal interactions with others . However , the outcomes of ' reciprocity of social interaction towards others ' and ' parental synchrony ' may be promising targets for interventions involving  pre-school children  with ASD .

" : This systematic review underlines the presence of a relationship  between executive functions  and  overweight/obesity .  Moreover , it seems to suggest a bidirectional trend in this relationship that could be the cause of the failure of interventions for weight reduction . The results of this review highlight the importance of a theoretical model able to consider all the main variables of interest , with the aim to structuring integrated approaches to solve the overweight/obesity problems."
"yBackground To develop a synthesis within a Bayesian probability framework of previously established evidence , in order to derive an overall conclusion about the hypothesis ( H1 ) : ‘  High-viscosity glass-ionomer cements ( HVGIC )  are inferior to  silver amalgam as ( load bearing ) restorative material s  for  permanent posterior  teeth ’ . Methods Following Bayesian method , the prior Odds that H1 is true ( established from past uncontrolled clinical longitudinal and laboratory trials ) , the Likelihood Ratio incorporating new evidence ( established from recent meta-epidemiological studies and systematic review s of controlled clinical trials ) , as well as the posterior hypothesis Odds in view of the new evidence , were calculated . Results The  prior Odds that  HVGICs  are clinical ly inferior to  amalgam   as restorative material s in posterior permanent teeth in relation to the hypothesis that this is not so was 1.12 to 1 . The  Likelihood Ratio  based on new evidence in favor the hypothesis was zero and the subsequent posterior Odds 0 to 1 . Therefore , based on the new evidence , the  Odds that HVGICs are clinical ly inferior to amalgam  as restorative material s in posterior permanent teeth degreased from 1.12 to zero . Conclusion The current evidence suggests lack of support for the hypothesis that  high-viscosity glass-ionomer cements  are inferior to silver amalgam as restorative material s for permanent posterior teeth . Should future research to this topic uphold the current findings , a wider range of clinical benefits for both patient and care provider , beyond appropriate restoration longevity for placing  HVGIC based restorations  may apply."
"AGreater  fish oil consumption  has been associated with reduced CVD risk , although the mechanisms are unclear .  Plant- source oil omega-3 fatty acids ( ALA )  have also been studied regarding their  cardiovascular effect .  We conducted a systematic review of r and  omized  controlled trials that evaluated the effect of consumption of  fish oil and ALA  on commonly measured serum CVD risk factors , performing meta-analyses when appropriate . Combining 21 trials evaluating lipid outcomes ,  fish oil  consumption result ed in a summary net change in  triglycerides  of -27 ( 95 % CI -33 , -20)mg/dL , in  HDL cholesterol  of + 1.6 ( 95 % CI + 0.8 , + 2.3)mg/dL , and in  LDL cholesterol  of + 6 ( 95 % CI + 3 , + 8)mg/dL. There was no effect of fish oil on  total cholesterol .  Across studies , higher fish oil dose and higher baseline levels were associated with greater reductions in  serum triglycerides .  Overall , the 27  fish  oil trials evaluating  Hgb  A(1c  )  or  FBS  found small non-significant net increases compared to control oils . Five studies of ALA were inconsistent in their effects  on lipids , Hgb A(1c ) or FBS .  Four studies investigating the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on  hs-CRP  were also inconsistent and non-significant . The evidence supports a dose-dependent beneficial effect of fish oil on  serum triglycerides  , particularly among people with more elevated levels .  Fish oil  consumption also modestly improves  HDL cholesterol ,  increases  LDL cholesterol levels  , but does not appear to adversely affect  glucose homeostasis .  The evidence regarding the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on hs-CRP is inconclusive , as are data on ALA."
" Due to the very low quality of the current evidence , the effects of  formal patient  education provided in addition to the st and ard information provided by doctors to patients compared with st and ard care remain uncertain . Further well- design ed r and omised clinical trials of low risk of bias are necessary."
" Serious somatic disease is rare in  patients complaining of  tiredness  .  Since prevalence is similar in patients without tiredness , the association may not be causal . Extensive investigations are only warranted in case of specific findings from the history or clinical examination . Instead , attention should focus on  depression  and  psychosocial problems ."
" The majority of evidence was inconclusive due to poor reporting , missing data , or uncertainty in treatment estimates . The findings warrant cautious interpretation given the risk of bias ( blinding , attrition ) , method ological limitations ( small sample size , low event counts , short follow-up ) , and poor reporting . Long-term pragmatic RCTs are needed to allow for more definitive conclusions . Authors are encouraged to specify the minimal clinical ly important difference and power calculation for their primary outcome ( s ) as well CONSORT , PRISMA and STROBE guidelines to ensure better reporting and more reliable production and assessment of evidence."

Video games  , the most commonly enjoyed medium by this generation of children , generates more money than Hollywood productions . Whereas some believe that games are anathema to childhood obesity prevention or treatment because most games involve sedentariness , the literature on media exposure and childhood obesity indicates that time watching television ( TV ) , and not time playing  video games  , is the major offending screen medium10 and the pathway of TV exposure to obesity is primarily through diet , not physical inactivity.11Games  for health  ( G4H ) is a new arena of research and practice that uses  entertainment game technology  to attain health goals . Diverse G4H have been design ed and tested for childhood obesity prevention and treatment.12 A scoping and systematic review of these articles identified 28 studies involving  video games  , mostly for childhood  obesity  prevention . Forty percent of these studies influenced  obesity or obesogenic behavior  in the desired directions.12 A roundtable discussion of investigators of G4H and obesity indicated substantial potential for  video games  to reduce  child obesity  , but emphasized the need for games to be fun , not just health promoting.13 Some of the obesity-related studies used games specially design ed to target  diet  and /or  PA  change outside the games.14 - 17 "" Squire 's Quest ! , "" targeted at dietary change alone , result ed in an increase of one serving of fruit and vegetables among  fourth- grade students  after only 5 weeks of  game play.15  "" Creature 101 , "" a comprehensive  behavior management  software system , including  video games  , enabled  middle school students  to decrease sweetened beverage and processed snack intake.16 "" Fitter Critters "" enhanced  attitudes and self-efficacy  toward healthy eating among  elementary school students.17  "" Escape from Diab "" and "" Nanoswarm : Invasion from Inner Space "" targeted  diet and  PA   among  10- to 12-year-olds  and achieved diet , but not  PA  , change.14Most research on games targeted at  PA  used commercially  available active video games  , also called  exergames . Exergames  were design ed by corporations as a new profit-making strategy to incorporate  PA  into game play ( e.g. , fancy footwork was needed for the game to progress ) . Reflecting public health interest in the potential of  exergames to encourage PA  , many review s of this literature have appeared.18 - 20 Some review s have been sympathetic,21,22 whereas others have been critical.23,24 A reasonably balanced assessment revealed that , in research laboratories ,  exergames  could provide an  intense workout  that  included moderate-to-vigorous  PA   , but under less-supervised circumstances , children tended not to  get much activity18  and their  interest in the activity  waned over 1 week or less .."
"eIntroduction :  Kinesiology  is a diagnostic , therapeutic complementary therapy utilising subtle change in manual muscle testing results to evaluate the body ’s energetic balance and select healing modalities . Anecdotal evidence suggests  kinesiology  is helpful , therefore we wished to critically review the literature . Aims : ( 1 ) To ascertain if diagnostic accuracy including inter-examiner reliability has been established . ( 2 ) To review whether there is evidence for its therapeutic effectiveness . ( 3 ) To critically assess the quality of relevant studies . Methods : Electronic data bases were search ed . Diagnostic accuracy studies were analysed and scored for method ological quality and quality of reporting using the quality assessment tool for studies of diagnostic accuracy included in systematic review s ( QUADAS ) and the St and ards for Reporting of Diagnostic Studies ( STARD ) . Clinical studies were analysed for method ological quality using the  JADAD  scale and for quality of reporting using the Consoli date d St and ards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) . Results :  22 original relevant studies were identified  . Their methodology was poor . Items reported on QUADAS scored 1 - 11 out of a possible 14 ,  STARD scores  were between 6 - 13 out of 25 ,  JADAD scores  were all 0 out of 5 and CONSORT 4 - 6 out of 22 . Consequently , we were unable to answer any of our research questions . Conclusion : There is insufficient evidence for diagnostic accuracy within  kinesiology  , the validity of muscle response and the effectiveness of  kinesiology  for any condition . The st and ards of reporting were low . We recommend a pragmatic study of the effectiveness of  kinesiology  as the most appropriate initial step to determine whether  kinesiology  has any clinical value."
"sBackground The prevalence of  overweight/obesity in adults  is raised to 39 % , which is nearly tripled more than 1975 . The alteration of the gut microbiome has been widely accepted as one of the main causal factors . To find an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of overweight/obesity , a systematic review and meta- analysis were design ed . Methods In this study , we systematic ally review ed the  article published from January 2008 to July 2018  and conducted a meta- analysis to examine the effects of  probiotics  on  body weight control , lipid profile , and glycemic control  in  healthy adults with overweight or obesity .  The primary outcomes were  body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference , fat mass , fat percentages , plasma lipid profiles , and glucose metabolic parameters  . Results We systematic ally search ed PubMed  , Embase , and the Web of Science and identified 1248 articles , and 7 articles which were manually search  ed by the references  of included  studies and previously systematic review s.  Twelve r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , including 821 participants  , were included in the meta- analysis via full-text screening .  Probiotics supplementation  result ed in a statistical  reduction in body weight  ( WMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.55 [ -0.91 , -0.19 ] kg )  , BMI  ( WMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.30 [ -0.43 , -0.18 ] kg m−2  ) , waist circumference  ( WMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -1.20 [ -2.21 , -0.19 ] cm  ) , fat mass  ( WMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.91 [ -1.19 , -0.63 ] kg  ) , and fat percentage  ( WMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.92 [ -1.27 , -0.56 ] % ) compared with control groups . As expected ,  the  metabolic parameters were improved significantly , with a pooled st and ardized  mean  difference  in  TC ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.43 [  -0.80  ,  -0.07 ] ) , LDL-C  ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.41 [ -0.77 ,  -0.04 ] ) ,  FPG ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.35 [ -0.67 ,  -0.02  ]  )  , insulin ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.44 [ -0.84 ,  -0.03  ]  ) , and HOMA-IR  ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.51 [ -0.96 , -0.05 ] ) ,  respectively  . The  changes in  TG ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; 0.14  [ -0.23  ,  0.50 ] )  ,  HDL-C  ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.31 [ -0.70 , 0.07  ] )  , and HbA1c ( SMD [ 95 % CI ] ; -0.23 [ -0.46 , 0.01 ] ) were not significant . Conclusion This study suggests that  the probiotics supplementation  could potentially  reduce the weight gain  and improve some of the associated metabolic  parameters  , which may become an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of obesity in adult individuals."
"nWe conducted a meta- analysis , including r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) and cohort studies , to examine the effect of  patient-specific instruments ( PSI )  on radiological  outcomes  after   total knee replacement  ( TKR )  including  : mechanical axis alignment and malalignment of the femoral and tibial components  in the  coronal  , sagittal and axial planes , at a threshold of > 3º from neutral .  Relative risks ( RR )  for malalignment were determined for all studies and for RCTs and cohort studies separately .  Of 325 studies initially identified , 16 met the eligibility criteria , including eight RCTs and eight cohort studies .  There was no significant  difference in the likelihood of mechanical axis malalignment   with PSI versus conventional TKR  across all studies ( RR = 0.84 , p = 0.304 ) , in the RCTs ( RR = 1.14 , p = 0.445 ) or in the cohort studies ( RR = 0.70 , p = 0.289 ) .  The results for the alignment of the tibial component were significantly worse   using PSI TKR than conventional TKR  in the coronal and sagittal planes ( RR = 1.75 , p = 0.028 ; and RR = 1.34 , p = 0.019 , respectively , on pooled analysis  ) . PSI TKR  showed  a significant advantage   over conventional TKR  for alignment of  the  femoral component in the coronal plane ( RR = 0.65 , p = 0.028 on pooled analysis ) , but not in the sagittal plane ( RR = 1.12 , p =  0.437 )  .  Axial  alignment of  the  tibial ( p = 0.460 ) and femoral components ( p = 0.127 ) was not significantly different . We  conclude that PSI  does not  improve the accuracy of  alignment of the components in TKR compared with conventional instrumentation."
"nOBJECTIVE This article review ed the literature to clarify the physiological effects and benefits of , and misconceptions about ,  stretches  used to reduce  musculoskeletal disorders .  METHODS  Nine data bases were  review ed to identify studies exploring the effectiveness of  stretching  to prevent  work-related musculoskeletal disorders .  Included studies were review ed and their method ological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale . RESULTS The physiological effects of  stretches  may contribute to reducing  discomfort and pain .  However , if other measures are not in place to remediate their causes , stretches may suppress  awareness of risks  , result ing in more  debilitating injuries .  If inadequately performed , stretches may also cause or aggravate injuries . Careful analysis and  stretching  program design are required before implementing stretches .  Seven studies evaluating  the   effectiveness   of   stretching   to  prevent musculoskeletal disorders in different occupations  were identified and review ed .  The studies provided mixed findings , but demonstrated some beneficial  effect  of  stretching  in preventing  work-related musculoskeletal disorders  . However , due to the relatively low method ological quality of the studies available in the literature , future studies are necessary for a definite response . Future studies should minimize threats to internal and external validity , have control groups , use appropriate follow-up periods , and present a more detailed description of the interventions and worker population."
" : For clinical use , we found no grounds to switch from 1 faces scale to another when 1 of the scales is in use . For research use , the FPS-R has been recommended on the basis of utility and psychometric features . Data are sparse for  children below the age of 5 years  , and future research should focus on simplified measures , instructions , and anchors for these younger children."
" The included trials did not demonstrate significant differences for most of the outcomes when targeting intensive perioperative glycaemic control compared with conventional glycaemic control in  patients with diabetes mellitus .  However , posthoc analysis indicated that intensive glycaemic control was associated with an increased number  of patients experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes  . Intensive glycaemic control protocol s with near-normal blood glucose targets for  patients with diabetes mellitus  undergoing surgical procedures are currently not supported by an adequate scientific basis . We suggest that insulin treatment regimens , patient- and health-system relevant outcomes , and time points for outcome measures should be defined in a thorough and uniform way in future studies."
 There is no convincing evidence that  iron  treatment of  young children with IDA  has an effect on  psychomotor development  discernable within 5 - 11 days . The effect of longer term treatment remains unclear but the data would be compatible with clinical ly significant benefit . There is urgent need for further r and omised controlled trials with long term follow up.
" There is currently insufficient high quality research to support  lifestyle interventions  post-stroke or TIA  on mortality , CVD event rates and cardio-metabolic risk factor profiles  .  Promising blood pressure reductions  were noted in multimodal interventions which addressed lifestyle."
" Review ing the data reveals that ERAS protocol s have a role in  reducing post-operative morbidity  and result  in an accelerated recovery  following colorectal surgery . Similarly ,  both primary and overall hospital stays  are reduced significantly . However , the available evidence suggests that ERAS protocol s do  not reduce hospital readmissions or mortality  . These findings help to confirm that ERAS protocol s should now be implemented as the st and ard approach for peri-operative care in colorectal surgery."

Little is known about how inequity and vulnerability are defined and measured in research on  task  shifting  .  We conducted a systematic review to identify how inequity and vulnerability are identified , defined and measured in   task  shifting research from high-income countries .  Methods and analysis We implemented a novel search process to identify programs of research concerning  task shifting interventions  in  high-income countries .  We search ed MEDLINE , Embase , CINAHL , PsycINFO , Web of Science , and CENTRAL to identify  articles published from 2004 to 2016 .  Each program of research incorporated a  “ parent ” r and omized trial and “ child ”  publications or sub- studies arising from the same research group . Two investigators extracted ( 1 ) study details , ( 2 ) definitions and measures of  health equity or population vulnerability  , and ( 3 ) assessed the  quality of the reporting and measurement of health equity and vulnerability  using a five-point scale developed for this study . We summarized the findings using a narrative approach . Results  Fifteen programs of research met  inclusion criteria ,  involving 15 parent r and omized trials and 62 child publications . Included programs of research were all undertaken in the United States , among Hispanic- ( 5/15 ) , African- ( 2/15 ) , and Korean-Americans ( 1/15 ) , and low socioeconomic status ( 2/15 ) , rural ( 2/15 ) and older adult population s ( 2/15 ) .   Task shifting interventions  included  community health workers , peers  , and a variety of other  non-professional and lay workers  to address a range of non-communicable diseases . Some research provided robust analyses of the affected population s ’ health inequities and demonstrated how a task shifting intervention redressed those concerns . Other studies provided no such definitions and measured only biomedical endpoints . Conclusion Included studies vary substantially in the  definition and measurement of health inequity and vulnerability .  A more precise theoretical and evaluative framework for  task shifting  is recommended to effectively achieve the goal of equitable health."
"sFructose is widely used as a sweetener in the production of many foods , yet the relation between fructose intake and cholesterol remains uncertain . In this study , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of human , controlled , feeding trials involving  isocaloric fructose exchange for other carbohydrates  to quantify the effects of  fructose  on  serum total cholesterol ( TC ) , LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C )  , and   HDL cholesterol  (  HDL-C )  in adult humans .  Weighted mean differences were calculated to determine changes from baseline cholesterol concentrations by means of generic , inverse variance , r and om-effect models . The Heyl and Method ological Quality was used to assess the quality of the study . Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to explore the possible influences of study characteristics .  Twenty-four trials ( with a total of 474 participants ) were included in the meta- analysis .  In an overall pooled estimate , it was shown that fructose exerted no effect on  HDL-C.  Meta-regression analysis indicated that fructose dose was positively correlated with the  effect sizes of TC and LDL-C.  Subgroup analyses showed  that isocaloric fructose exchange for carbohydrates   increased TC  by 13.0 mg/dL [ ( 95 % CI : 4.7 , 21.3 ) ; P = 0.002 ] and  LDL-C  by 11.6 mg/dL [ ( 95 % CI : 4.4 , 18.9 ) ; P = 0.002 ] at > 100 g fructose/d . However , no effect was shown  on TC or LDL-C  when the fructose intake was ≤100 g/d . In conclusion , it was shown that  very high fructose  intake ( > 100 g/d )  increases serum LDL-C and TC concentrations  . Larger , longer , and higher- quality human , controlled , feeding trials are needed to confirm these results."
"ePURPOSE To provide guidelines for patient recall regimen , professional maintenance regimen , and at-home maintenance regimen for  patients with tooth- and implant-borne removable and fixed restorations .  METHODS The  American College of Prosthodontists ( ACP )  convened a scientific panel of experts appointed by the ACP , American Dental Association ( ADA ) , Academy of General Dentistry ( AGD ) , and American Dental Hygienists Association ( ADHA ) who critically evaluated and debated recently published findings from 2 systematic review s on this topic . The major outcomes and consequences considered during formulation of the clinical practice guidelines ( CPGs ) were  risk for failure of tooth- and implant-borne restorations .  The panel conducted a round table discussion of the proposed guidelines , which were debated in detail . Feedback was used to supplement and refine the proposed guidelines , and consensus was attained . RESULTS A set of CPGs was developed for  tooth-borne restorations and implant-borne restorations .  Each CPG comprised of 1 ) patient recall ; 2 ) professional maintenance , and 3 ) at-home maintenance . For tooth-borne restorations , the professional maintenance and at-home maintenance CPGs were subdivided for removable and fixed restorations . For implant-borne restorations , the professional maintenance CPGs were subdivided for  removable and fixed restorations  and further divided into  biological maintenance and mechanical maintenance for each type of restoration .  The at-home maintenance CPGs were subdivided for removable and fixed  restorations .   The clinical practice guidelines presented in this document were initially developed using the 2 systematic review s. Additional guidelines were developed using expert opinion and consensus , which included discussion of the best clinical practice s ,  clinical feasibility and risk-benefit ratio  to the patient . To the authors ' knowledge , these are the first CPGs addressing patient recall regimen , professional maintenance regimen , and at-home maintenance regimen for  patients with tooth-borne and implant-borne restorations .  This document serves as a baseline with the expectation of future modifications when additional evidence becomes available."
" The effects of  HIIT  appear to be comparable to those of  continuous exercise  in relation to  functional and cardiovascular responses  . However , our findings should be interpreted with caution because the studies evaluated present a high risk of bias , which could have a direct influence on the results."
" Current evidence suggests that epicardial  ablative strategies  are associated with higher  freedom from AF  ,  higher pacemaker implantation rates  and comparable  neurological complications and cardiac tamponade  incidence to  catheter ablative  treatment . Other complications and risks were poorly reported , which warrants further r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of adequate power and follow-up duration."
" Moderate evidence showed that the fibrate class can be effective in the secondary prevention of composite  outcome of non-fatal stroke , non-fatal MI , and vascular death .  However , this beneficial effect relies on the inclusion of clofibrate data , a drug that was discontinued in 2002 due to its unacceptably large adverse effects . Further trials of the use of  fibrates  in population  s with previous stroke  and also against a background treatment with statins ( st and ard of care ) are required."
"aBackground In medical practice , the tendency to remove an inflamed gallbladder is deeply rooted .  Cholecystectomy  , however , is associated with relatively high complication rates , and therefore the decision whether or not to perform surgery should be well considered . For some patients , the surgical risk – benefit profile may favour conservative treatment . The objective of this study was to examine the  short-  and  long-term outcome  of conservative treatment of  patients with acute calculous cholecystitis .  Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE , Embase and Cochrane Library data bases was performed . Prospect i ve studies reporting on the success rate of  conservative treatment ( i.e. non-invasive treatment )  of acute cholecystitis during index admission were included , as well as prospect i ve and retrospective studies reporting on the recurrence rate of gallstone-related disease during long-term follow-up ( i.e. ≥12 months ) after initial non-surgical management . Study selection was undertaken independently by two review ers using predefined criteria . The risk of bias was assessed .  The pooled success and mortality rate  during  index admission and the pooled recurrence rate of gallstone-related disease  during long-term follow-up were calculated using a r and om-effects model . Results  A total of 1841 patients were included in 10 r and omized controlled trials and 14 non-r and omized studies .   Conservative treatment  during index admission was  successful  in 87 % of patients with  acute calculous cholecystitis  and in 96 % of patients with mild disease . In the long term , 22 % of the patients  developed recurrent gallstone-related disease  . Pooled analysis showed  a success rate  of 86 % ( 95 % CI 0.8–0.9 ) ,  a mortality rate  of 0.5 % ( 95 % CI 0.001–0.009 ) and  a recurrence rate  of 20 % ( 95 % CI 0.1–0.3 ) . Discussion Conservative treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis during index admission seems feasible and safe , especially in  patients with mild disease  . During long-term follow-up , less than a quarter of the patients appear to develop  recurrent gallstone-related disease  , although this outcome is based on limited data."
" The results are limited by the heterogeneity between trials in terms of participants recruited , interventions and duration of follow-up . Limited data suggest that  systematic risk assessment  for CVD has no statistically significant effects on clinical endpoints . There is limited evidence to suggest that CVD systematic risk assessment may have some favourable effects on  cardiovascular  risk factors . The completion of the five ongoing trials will add to the evidence base."
"dRecently , there is a growing interest in surgical variables that are intraoperatively controlled by orthopaedic surgeons , including  lower leg alignment  ,  component positioning  and  soft tissues balancing .  Since more tight control over these factors is associated with improved outcomes of  unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty ( TKA )  , several  computer navigation and robotic-assisted systems  have been developed . Although mechanical axis accuracy and component positioning have been shown to improve with  computer  navigation , no superiority in functional outcomes has yet been shown . This could be explained by the fact that many differences exist between the number and type of surgical variables these systems control . Most systems control lower leg alignment and component positioning , while some in addition control soft tissue balancing . Finally , robotic-assisted systems have the additional advantage of improving surgical precision . A systematic search in PubMed , Embase and Cochrane Library result ed in  40 comparative studies and three registries on computer navigation reporting outcomes of 474,197 patients , and 21 basic science and clinical studies on  robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty .   Twenty-eight of these  comparative computer navigation studies reported  Knee Society Total scores  in 3504 patients .  Stratifying by type of surgical variables , no significant differences were noted in outcomes between surgery with  computer-navigated TKA  controlling for alignment and component positioning versus  conventional TKA  ( p = 0.63 ) . However , significantly better outcomes were noted following  computer-navigated TKA  that also controlled for soft tissue balancing versus conventional  TKA  ( mean difference 4.84 , 95 % Confidence Interval 1.61 , 8.07 , p = 0.003 ) . A literature review of  robotic systems  showed that these systems can , similarly to computer navigation , reliably  improve lower leg alignment , component positioning and soft tissues balancing .  Furthermore , two studies comparing  robotic-assisted  with  computer-navigated surgery  reported superiority of  robotic-assisted surgery  in controlling these factors . Manually controlling all these surgical variables can be difficult for the orthopaedic surgeon . Findings in this study suggest that computer navigation or robotic assistance may help managing these multiple variables and could  improve outcomes .  Future studies assessing the role of  soft tissue balancing  in knee arthroplasty and long-term follow-up studies assessing the role of  computer-navigated and robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty  are needed."
"ePostural  instability  is common in  Parkinson ’s disease ( PD )  , often contributing to  falls , injuries  , and  reduced mobility .  In the clinical setting , balance disorder is commonly diagnosed using clinical tests and balance scales , but it is suggested that the most sensitive measurement is the force platform . The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the methods and  various posturographic procedures  used to assess the body balance and gait in PD  .  A systematic review was conducted of papers published  from 2000 to 2017 .  Data bases search ed were PubMed and EBSCO . Studies must have involved  patients with PD  , used   force platform  or motion  analysis system   as a measurement  tool  , and described  posturographic procedure .  The Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) scale was used to assess the method ological quality of the included studies .  A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria .  The PEDro scores ranged from 5 to 7 points . The analysis of the objective methods assessing  balance disorders  revealed a large discrepancy in the duration and procedures of  measurements  . The  number of repetitions of each trial  fluctuated between 1 and 8 , and the duration of a single trial ranged from 10 to 60 seconds . Overall , there are many scales and tests used to assess the  balance disorders  and disabilities of  people with PD .  Although in many included studies the authors have used  posturography  as a method to evaluate the  postural instability  of  PD patients  , the results are contradictory . To solve this issue , it is indicated to establish a “ gold st and ard ” of procedures of measures of balance."

"sPURPOSE OF REVIEW  Refractory dyspnoea  is a common and difficult to treat symptom in  advanced disease .  Accurate assessment helps to guide treatment and prognosis . RECENT FINDINGS The absence of commonly agreed assessment tools has been a significant barrier to improving care through inhibition of clinical research and limitation of clinicians ' ability to assess the effectiveness of their interventions . Two recently published systematic review s on measurement tools for  breathlessness  identified a variety of tools but none could be recommended as gold st and ard . Validation of these tools in palliative care seems more appropriate than development of new tools . For clinical purpose s , the combination of a unidimensional tool to  assess dyspnoea severity  and a multidimensional tool to evaluate  the impact on a person 's quality of life  seem most appropriate . This review discusses the present evidence and puts forward a strategy for assessment and measurement of the  symptom  in clinical practice . SUMMARY Despite a variety of measurement tools none can be recommended as gold st and ard for the assessment of  dyspnoea .  A combination of unidimensional and multidimensional tools seems to be the best for clinical assessment . Measurement of  dyspnoea  has to be seen in context with the person 's history , physical examination and diagnostic tests."
" We found moderate- to low- quality evidence that  exercise programmes  probably slightly improve  function  , may reduce  pain  , and probably slightly reduce  global patient assessment of disease activity  , when compared with no intervention , and measured upon completion of the programme . We found moderate- to low- quality evidence that  exercise programmes  probably have little or no effect on improving  function  or reducing  pain  , when compared with usual care , and may have little or no effect on reducing  patient assessment of disease activity  , when measured upon completion of the programmes . We are uncertain whether  exercise programmes  improve  spinal mobility  , reduce  fatigue  , or induce adverse effects."
"lAIM The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of  h and splinting  for improving  h and function  in  children with cerebral palsy ( CP ) and brain injury .  METHOD A systematic review with meta-analyses was conducted . Only r and omized and quasi-r and  omized  controlled trials in which  all participants were children aged 0 to 18 years with CP or brain injury and a  h and splint ( cast , brace , or orthosis )  were included  . RESULTS  Six studies  met the inclusion criteria . No study included  participants with a brain injury ;  therefore , the results relate only to CP . Five studies investigated ' non-functional h  and splints  ' and one investigated a ' functional  h and splint  ' . Moderate- quality evidence indicated a small  benefit of non-functional h and splints plus therapy on upper limb skills  over  therapy  alone ( st and ard mean difference [SMD]=0.81 , 95 % confidence interval [CI]=0.03 - 1.58 ) , although benefits were diminished 2 to 3 months after splint wearing stopped ( SMD=0.35 , CI -0.06 to 0.77 ) . INTERPRETATION In  children with CP  ,  h and splints  may have a small  benefit  for  upper limb skills .  However , results are diminished after splint wearing stops . Given the costs - potential negative  cosmesis  and  discomfort  for the child - clinicians must consider whether  h and splinting  is clinical ly worthwhile . Further method ologically sound research regarding  h and splinting  combined with evidence -based therapy is needed to investigate whether the small clinical effect is meaningful."

"eBACKGROUND Exp and ing  public  health  insurance  seeks to attain several desirable objectives , including increasing access to healthcare services , reducing the risk of  catastrophic  healthcare expenditures , and improving health  outcomes .  The extent to which these objectives are met in a real-world policy context remains an empirical question of increasing research and policy interest in recent years . METHODS We review ed systematic ally empirical studies  published from July 2010 to September 2016 using Medline , Embase , Econlit , CINAHL Plus via EBSCO  ,  and Web of Science and grey literature data  bases . No language restrictions were applied . Our focus was on both r and omised and observational studies , particularly those including explicitly attempts to tackle selection bias in estimating the treatment effect of  health  insurance  .  The main outcomes are :  ( 1 ) utilisation of health services , ( 2 ) financial protection for the target population , and ( 3 ) changes in health status .  FINDINGS  8755 abstract s and 118 full-text articles were assessed . Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria  including six r and omised studies , reflecting a substantial increase in the  quantity and quality  of research output compared to the time period before 2010 . Overall  , health insurance schemes  in  low- and middle-income countries  (  LMICs  ) have been found to  improve access to health care  as measured by increased  utilisation of health care facilities  ( 32 out of 40 studies ) . There also appeared to be a  favourable effect on financial protection  ( 26 out of 46 studies ) , although several studies indicated otherwise . There is moderate evidence that  health insurance schemes   improve the health of the insured  ( 9 out of 12 studies ) . INTERPRETATION Increased  health insurance  coverage generally appears to increase  access to health care facilities  ,  improve financial protection and improve health status  , although findings are not totally consistent . Underst and ing the drivers of differences in the outcomes of insurance reforms is critical to inform future implementations of publicly funded  health  insurance to achieve the broader goal of universal health coverage."

"sControversy exists regarding the clinical and radiological differences in outcomes between   fixed-bearing ( FB )  and  mobile-bearing ( MB ) total knee arthroplasties  ( TKAs )  at the mid- or long-term follow-up . We therefore conducted a meta- analysis and systematic review of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that have evaluated  FB and MB TKAs .  We search ed the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) in the Cochrane Library , Medline and Embase . The data , including  demographic information , method ological quality , duration of follow-up , clinical and radiographical outcomes , patient preferences and complications  , were extracted . The method ological quality of the studies was assessed in accordance with the guidelines presented in the Cochrane H and book for Systematic Review s of Interventions .  Nine trials , study ing 1,821 knees  , were eligible for data extraction and meta- analysis . The  Knee Society score and the maximum knee flexion  demonstrated no difference between the FB and MB groups ( P=0.47 and P=0.72 , respectively ) . Similarly , no difference was revealed between the groups for  radiological outcomes or general health results .  An increased number of high- quality RCTs with long-term follow-ups are required to vali date the results."

"FAtrial  fibrillation ( AF )  is a well-established risk factor of  thromboembolism ( TE ) . Thromboembolism  is one of the most common complications in  patients supported by continuous-flow left ventricular assisted devices ( CF-LVADs ) .  However , the association between AF and TE complications in this population is controversial . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to assess the association between AF and  overall TE , stroke ,  and  device thrombosis events  in  CF-LVAD patients .  We performed a comprehensive literature search through  September 2017  in the data bases of MEDLINE and EMBASE . Included studies were prospect i ve or retrospective cohort studies that compared the risk of developing  overall TE , stroke , and device thrombosis events  in  CF-LVAD patients with AF  and  those without AF .  We calculated  pooled relative risk (  RR ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) and I statistic using the r and om-effects model .  Eleven studies were included involving 6,351 patients who underwent  CF-LVAD implantation .   Overall ,  TE outcome  was available in four studies involving 1,106 AF and  3,556  non-AF patients .  Stroke outcome  was available in seven studies ( 1,455 AF and 4,037 non-AF patients ) .  Device thrombosis  outcome was available in three studies ( 1,010 AF and 3,327 non-AF patients ) . There was no association between  AF and TE events  ( RR = 0.95 ; 95 % CI : 0.57 - 1.59 , I = 79 % , p = 0.85 ) ,  stroke  ( RR = 1.10 ; 95 % CI : 0.74 - 1.64 , I = 73 % , p = 0.65 ) , and  device thrombosis  ( RR = 0.97 ; 95 % CI : 0.56 - 1.67 , I = 42 % , p = 0.91 ) . AF  in CF-LVAD patients  was not associated with  overall TE , stroke , or device thrombosis events .  These findings might be explained by the highly thrombogenic property of CF-LVADs that exceeds the thromboembolic risk driven by AF."

"nAn increasing number of original studies suggest that sedentary behavior is associated with the  risk of dementia  , but the results remain inconsistent and inconclusive . In this meta- analysis , we analyzed available observational epidemiological evidence to identify the association between  sedentary   behavior  and the risk of   dementia   . We search ed PubMed and Embase from their inception to March 2019 to identify observational studies examining the association between   sedentary behavior   and   risk  of  dementia  .  Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality using predefined criteria . The Q statistics and I² methods were used to test for heterogeneity . The publication bias of the included studies was also estimated using Begg ’s and Egger ’s tests . We identified  18 relevant cohort studies involving 250,063 participants and 2269 patients with dementia .  Pooled result showed that  sedentary behavior  was significantly associated with  increased risk of dementia  ( RR = 1.30 ; 95 % CI : 1.12–1.51 ) . In addition , subgroup analyses by state , and controlling for the concomitant effects of age , sex , education were conducted for the  increase of dementia  risk , relating to sedentary , respectively . In general , these subgroup analyses showed no statistically significant differences . The results of our meta- analysis suggested that  sedentary behavior  was independently associated with a  significantly increased risk of dementia  , which might have important implication s in conducting etiological studies for dementia and developing strategies for dementia prevention."
" : On the basis of indirect comparisons across study findings , the apparent association between indexes of  liver health ( ie , liver fat , hepatic de novo lipogenesis , alanine aminotransferase , AST , and γ-glutamyl transpeptase )  and fructose or sucrose intake appear to be confounded by excessive energy intake . Overall , the available evidence is not sufficiently robust to draw conclusions regarding effects  of fructose , HFCS  , or  sucrose  consumption on  NAFLD ."
"yOBJECTIVE  Interproximal enamel reduction  is a part of orthodontic treatment for gaining a modest amount of space in the treatment of crowding . Today  interproximal enamel reduction  has become a viable alternative to the extraction of permanent teeth , and helps to adjust the Bolton Index discrepancy . The aim of the study is to evaluate various  interproximal enamel reduction techniques  , its indications , contraindications and complications presented in recent scientific studies . MATERIAL AND METHODS  Papers published in English language between 2003 and 2012 were search  ed in PubMed , ScienceDirect and The Cochrane Library data bases , as well as the Web search Google Scholar . Initial search es were made to find peer- review ed systematic review s , meta-analyses , literature review s , clinical trials , which analysed at least one   interproximal  enamel reduction  method .  31 published data  fulfilled the inclusion criteria . RESULTS According to the study ,  abrasive metal strips , diamond-coated stripping disks , and air-rotor stripping  are the main  interproximal enamel reduction  techniques . Indications for use are  mild or moderate crowding in dental arches , Bolton Index discrepancy , changes in tooth shape and dental esthetics within the enamel , enhancement of retention and stability after orthodontic treatment , normalization of gingival contour , elimination of black gingival triangles , and correction of the Curve of Spee . Complications  of  interproximal enamel reduction  are  hypersensitivity , irreversible damage of dental pulp , increased formation of plaque , the risk of caries in the stripped enamel areas and periodontal diseases .    Interproximal enamel reduction  is an important part of orthodontic treatment for gaining space in the dental arch , and for the correction of the Bolton index discrepancy."
"sAssessment s of gait , balance , and transfer in  elderly people  play a valuable role in maintaining healthy aging and preventing a decline in mobility . Several evaluation tools have been proposed ; however , clinicians should select the most accurate ones wisely , based on numerous criteria . This systematic review aims to identify all applicable  elderly mobility assessment tests  and show their measurement properties with as much detail as possible . Initially , a broad search was performed . Articles were screened based on their titles and abstract s , and  only studies published in English were considered  . Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria ,  31 assessment tests  evaluating the mobility of  healthy elderly people  were found . Then , further search es were completed to identify the measurement properties of each test . These characteristics include the origin and year of establishment , several practicality factors , and validity . The analysis of our outcomes illustrates the similarities  and differences  between the identified tests."
"dOBJECTIVE To review , in conformance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines , the totality of evidence for the use of  neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES )  in the critical care setting , when compared with usual care , under all domains of the World Health Organisation , International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF ) framework . DATA SOURCE Six electronic data bases were search ed : PubMed , Embase , Web of Knowledge , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , The Cochrane Library and the Physiotherapy Evidence  Data base  (  PEDro ) (  1945  - 2014 )  . Limits of the English language and human studies were applied . STUDY SELECTION Trials investigating the effect of   NMES  in critical care adult patients  were included . One review er excluded articles by title . Two review ers excluded remaining articles by abstract and full text . One review er extracted data under a st and ardised form . Two review ers assessed method ological quality using the  Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale  . RESULTS Twelve full-text articles , eleven r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) and one case-control trial indicated the potential of NMES to  preserve muscle mass and joint range of motion , improve outcomes of ventilation , and reduce activity limitations .  Meta- analysis from three RCTs supported NMES to  preserve muscle strength  using a fixed-effects model [ n = 146 ; st and ardised mean difference 0.93 ( 0.51 , 1.35 ) P = 0.0002 ] ; however , significant heterogeneity was recorded . No outcomes evaluated the effect on participation restrictions .  NMES , as an adjunct to current rehabilitation practice s in  critically ill patients  , may  maintain muscle strength .  However , high- quality studies with longer follow-up periods and st and ardised outcome measures across all domains of the ICF framework are required."

"tIn a 1998 review article , Laurell and colleagues performed a meta- analysis of relevant guided tissue  regeneration  ( GTR ) articles over the previous 20 years ( 1 ) . The purpose of the present research was to exp and on that work , particularly search ing for trends discriminating between bioabsorbable and non-bioabsorbable barriers , as well as the use of  enamel matrix derivative  , with respect to  interproximal bony defects .  The most recent periodontal journals were review ed and a search of PubMed ( National Institutes of Health ) was conducted via the internet covering 1990 to the present .  Forty-nine articles  were found to be relevant and within established parameters . The data were analyzed using ( a ) a variation of the methods described in Laurell et al. ( 1 ) and ( b ) statistics appropriate for inter-group comparisons . In most respects , all  membranes  and  enamel matrix derivative ( EMD )  delivered better outcomes , in the range of 1 to 2 mm , than open flap debridement . The use of any barrier type or EMD configuration was found to yield more  Clinical Attachment Level ( CAL ) gain  than any open flap configuration . Other than collagen without grafts versus non-bioabsorbables without grafts , no other comparison between membranes or between  membranes  and  EMD  found any significant differences ( P > 0.05 ) .  GTR  was confirmed to be superior to open flap debridement."
" PRT appears to be an effective intervention to increase  strength  in  older people  and has a positive effect on some functional limitations . However , the effect of this intervention on more substantive outcomes such as  measures of disability or HRQOL  remains unclear . It is difficult to determine the balance of risks and benefits of PRT because adverse events have generally been poorly collected and recorded."
"nOBJECTIVE To demonstrate the application of the  modified Ottawa method  by establishing the up date need of a systematic review with focus on the  caries preventive effect of  GIC versus resin pit and fissure sealants ;   to answer the question as to whether the existing conclusions of this systematic review are still current ; to establish whether a new up date of this systematic review was needed . METHODS Application of the  Modified Ottawa method .  Application date : April/May  2012  . RESULTS Four signals aligned with the criteria of the modified Ottawa method were identified . The content of these signals suggest that higher precision of the current systematic review results might be achieved if an up date of the current review were conducted at this point in time . However , these signals further indicate that such systematic review up date , despite its higher precision , would only confirm the existing review conclusion that no statistically significant difference exists in the  caries-preventive effect  of GIC and resin-based fissure sealants .  In conclusion , this study demonstrated the  modified Ottawa method  as an effective tool in establishing the up date need of the systematic review . In addition , it was established that the conclusions of the systematic review in relation to the  caries  preventive effect of  GIC versus resin based fissure sealants  are still current , and that no up date of this systematic review was warranted at date of application."

"dThe objective of this study was to systematic ally review studies describing the association between  vasomotor symptoms  and  metabolic syndrome  , type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in  peri- and postmenopausal women .  A systematic search of studies was performed in EMBASE , MEDLINE , Web-of-science , Scopus , PubMed publisher , Cochrane Library , Google scholar . To identify studies eligible for inclusion , the following criteria were defined : r and omised trials , cohort , case-control , and cross-sectional studies investigating the association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in  peri- and postmenopausal women with natural menopause .  Method ological quality was assessed using a modified  NewCastle Ottawa Assessment Scale .  After screening  2660 titles and abstract s  ,  four  studies , of which two cohort  studies met the criteria of high  method ological  quality  , were included in the review . Because of the heterogeneity and the limited number of studies , there is no sufficient evidence on the potential role of  vasomotor symptoms  in metabolic health  .  However , both high- quality cohort studies , with large study population s and adjustment for multiple confounding variables showed positive  associations between vasomotor symptoms and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus .  These findings suggest that there is an  association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .  To confirm this and to strengthen the evidence , more high quality longitudinal research on this topic is needed."

"hBackground Both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) have approved  aripiprazole  for use  in adolescents  for specific indications . Given the assumed favorable side-effect profile of  aripiprazole  , its use in  children and adolescents  has increased for both official and off-label indications ( anxiety disorders , eating disorders , personality disorders ) . However , several cases of  children and adolescents with  new-onset   extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS )   after commencing treatment with  aripiprazole  have been reported , and a more systematic appraisal of this possible risk is lacking . Objective We conducted a systematic review and a meta- analysis to assess the evidence for acute  EPS ( acute dystonia , akathisia , Parkinsonism )  associated with the use of  aripiprazole  in  children and adolescents .  Method We search ed  the MEDLINE and Embase data bases ( 2003–10 April 2016 ) for clinical trials in pediatric patients ( aged 0–18 years )  using the keywords  ‘ aripiprazole ’  ( regardless of the formulation ) and ‘ extrapyramidal symptoms ’ . We evaluated the abstract s of papers using the following exclusion criteria : ( 1  ) study  design  :  case report , letter to the editor , editorial , or poster presentation  data ; ( 2 ) unrelated PICOS ( population , intervention , comparators , outcomes , study ) structure .  We performed a meta- analysis , in which we used effect sizes with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) . To examine the homogeneity of the effect size distribution , we used a Q-statistic . When we observed heterogeneity in effect sizes , we assessed the possible influence of moderator variables ( age and sex , mean dose , study duration , and method of measuring EPS incidence ) and evaluated the suitability of either a fixed or a r and om model . Finally , we assessed the  incidence of EPS  in  children and adolescents  treated with  aripiprazole  compared with  placebo .  Results An initial search via PubMed and Embase yielded 328 hits . A manual search of the reference lists of review papers revealed seven additional relevant articles .  We included 41 studies , with 2114 pediatric patients , in the meta- analysis .  For the analysis of the  mean incidence of EPS  ,  data were  provided  by 24 studies , with a total of 1446 pediatric patients .  Meta- analysis revealed a  mean EPS incidence  of 17.1 % ( 95 % CI 0.128–0.223 ) . In terms of the incidence of various extrapyramidal side effects , overall , no significant effects of age , sex , mean dose , study duration , or measuring method could be demonstrated . The  side effects ‘ EPS ’ , ‘ parkinsonism ’ , and ‘ tremor ’  were significantly more common in children and adolescents treated with aripiprazole than in those treated with  placebo  . Conclusion Our meta- analysis provides evidence for a non-negligible incidence of acute EPS in  children and adolescents treated with aripiprazole  . Although the study has several limitations and further investigation is needed , these findings may help clinicians make more balanced treatment choices and more closely monitor the use of this drug in youth."

"dOBJECTIVES The effects of  statins  on  insulin sensitivity  , metabolic homeostasis and adipokines in  humans  are controversial . Several studies have investigated the impact of  statin  therapy on  plasma leptin concentrations  but the results have been inconsistent . The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of available evidence to calculate the effect size of  statin therapy  in changing  serum leptin concentrations  . METHODS A systematic search in PubMed - Medline , SCOPUS , Web of Science and Google Scholar data bases was performed to identify  r and omized  placebo-controlled  trials  investigating the  effect  of   statins  on plasma leptin concentrations  . A r and om-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for meta- analysis . Sensitivity analysis , risk-of-bias evaluation and publication bias assessment were carried out using st and ard methods . R and om-effects meta-regression was used to evaluate the impact of treatment duration on the estimated effect size . RESULTS  Six trials , with a total of 425 subjects , met the eligibility criteria .  Overall  , statin  therapy had no significant effect  on leptin levels  ( weighted mean difference -0.32 ng ml-1 , 95 % confidence nterval : -2.94 , 2.30 , P = 0.813 ) . This effect was robust in the sensitivity analysis and in subgroup analyses of trials with < 12 or ≥12 weeks ' duration . There was no association between  the  duration of statin  therapy and changes in plasma leptin levels .  Furthermore , there was no differential effect of hydrophilic and lipophilic  statins  on  plasma leptin concentrations  .  Unless more consistent evidence becomes available in the future , the hypothesis of a relationship between statin use and  serum leptin  concentrations seem to be unfounded."

"sObjectives We systematic ally assessed r and omized controlled trials comparing  direct pulp capping material s.  Methods Trials comparing  material s  for  direct capping  and evaluating  clinical ly and /or radiographically determined success  after minimum 3 months were included . Two review ers independently screened electronic data bases ( Medline , Central , Embase ) and performed h and search es . Risk of bias was assessed and meta-analyses were performed , separated for dentition . Trial sequential analysis was used to assess risk of r and om errors . Strength of evidence was grade d using the GRADE approach . Results  From a total of 453 identified studies , 11 ( all with high risk of bias ) investigating 1094 teeth ( 922 patients ) were included .  Six studies were on  primary teeth  ( all  with carious exposures  ) and five  on permanent teeth  (  carious and artificial exposures  ) . Mean follow-up was 14 months ( range 3–24 ) . Most studies used  calcium hydroxide  as  control  , comparing it to  mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA )  ( three studies ) ,  bonding without prior etching/conditioning  ( two ) , or  bonding with prior etching/conditioning , enamel matrix proteins , resin-modified glass ionomer cement , calcium sulfate , zinc oxide eugenol , corticosteroids , antibiotics ,  or  formocresol  ( each in only one study ) . One study compared  MTA and calcium-enriched cement .  In permanent teeth ,  risk of failure  was significantly decreased if  MTA  instead of  calcium hydroxide  was used ( risk ratio ( RR ) [ 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) ] 0.59 [ 0.39/0.90 ] ) ; no difference was found for primary teeth . Other comparisons did not find significant differences or were supported by only one study . No firm evidence was reached according to trial sequential analysis . Conclusion There is insufficient data to recommend or refute the use of a specific material . More long-term practice -based studies with real-life exposures are required . Clinical relevance To reduce risk of failure , dentists might consider using  MTA instead of calcium hydroxide ( CH )  for direct capping . Current evidence is insufficient for definitive recommendations."
"hBACKGROUND  Glass-ionomers  are traditionally regarded to be inferior to resin as  fissure sealants  in protecting teeth from dental caries , due to their comparatively lower retention rate . Unlike low-viscosity  glass-ionomers  ,  high-viscosity glass-ionomer cements ( HVGIC )  are placed as sealants by pressing the material into pits and fissures with a petroleum-jelly-coated index finger . Hence ,  HVGIC sealants  are assumed to penetrate pits and fissures deeper , result ing in a higher material retention rate , which may increase its caries-preventive  effect  . METHODS The aim of this review was to answer the question as to whether , in  patients with fully erupted permanent molar teeth  ,  HVGIC based fissure sealants  are less effective to protect against dental carious lesions in occlusal pits and fissures than  resin-based fissure sealants  ? A systematic literature search in eight data bases was conducted . Heterogeneity of accepted trials and imprecision of the established evidence were assessed . Extracted sufficiently homogenous data sets were pooled by use of a r and om-effects meta- analysis . Internal trial validity was evaluated . The protocol of this systematic review was registered with the International Prospect i ve Register of Systematic Review s ( PROSPERO / Nr . : CRD42015016007 ) . RESULTS  Seven clinical trials  were provisionally included for further review . Of these , one was excluded . Seven trial reports reporting on six trials were accepted . From these , 11 data sets were extracted and pooled in four meta-analyses . The results suggest no  statistically significant differences  after up to 48 months and borderline  significant  differences in favour of   HVGIC sealants   after 60 months ( RR 0.29 ; 95 % CI : 0.09 - 0.95 ; p = 0.04 / RD -0.07 ; 95 % CI : -0.14 , -0.01 ) . The point estimates and upper confidence levels after 24 , 36 , 48 and 60 months of RR 1.36 ; RR 0.90 ; RR 0.62 ; RR 0.29 and 2.78 ; 1.67 ; 1.21 ; 0.95 , respectively , further suggest a chronological trend in favour of  HVGIC above resin-based sealants .  The  internal trial validity  was judged to be low and the bias risk high for all trials .  Imprecision of results  was considered too high for clinical guidance .  It can be concluded that : ( i ) Inferiority cl aims against  HVGIC  in comparison to  resin-based sealants  as current gold-st and ard are not supported by the clinical evidence ; ( ii ) The clinical evidence suggests similar  caries-preventive efficacy  of  HVGIC  and  resin-based sealants  after a period of 48 months in permanent molar teeth but remains challenged by high bias risk ; ( iii ) Evidence concerning a possible  superiority of  HVGIC  above  resin-based sealants   after 60 months is poor ( even if the high bias risk is disregarded ) due to imprecision and requires corroboration through future research."
"dChronic  pain complaints  after  thoracic surgery  represent a significant clinical problem in 25 -  60  % of  patients .  Results from  thoracic  and other  surgical procedures  suggest multiple pathogenic mechanisms that include pre- , intra- , and postoperative factors . This review attempts to analyse the methodology and systematic s of the studies on the    post-thoracotomy pain syndrome  ( PTPS )  after  lung cancer surgery  in adults  , in order to clarify the relative role of possible pathogenic factors and to define future strategies for prevention . Literature published from 2000 to 2008 together with studies included in previous systematic review s was search ed recursively using PubMed and OVID by combining three categories of search terms . The available data have major inconsistencies in collection of pre- , intra- and postoperative data that may influence PTPS , thereby hindering precise conclusions as well as preventive and treatment strategies . However , intercostal nerve injury seems to be the most important pathogenic factor . Since there is a general agreement on the clinical relevance of PTPS , a proposal for design of future trials is presented."

"nDecreasing levels of  estrogens  during menopause are associated with reduced  bone density  and an increased risk of  osteoporosis .  Many women also experience bothersome  vasomotor and vaginal symptoms  during the  menopausal transition  . Results of systematic review s and meta-analyses of r and omized controlled trials have shown that both  systemic estrogen therapy or hormone therapy ( estrogen combined with a progestin )  are useful to prevent  bone loss  , and they are the most effective treatment for such  climacteric symptoms  as  hot flushes , sweating , vaginal dryness , and dyspareunia .  Unfortunately ,  estrogen  therapy and  hormone therapy  increase the risk of endometrial and breast cancer , respectively . The selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) result in positive  estrogenic effects on bone  , with no negative effects on the endometrium and breast but do not provide relief from postmenopausal symptoms . The combination of a  SERM with estrogen as a tissue selective estrogen complex (  TSEC  )  is a new strategy for the prevention of  bone loss  and the treatment of  climacteric symptoms .  This combination is particularly interesting from a clinical point of view , taking into account that estrogen alone did not increase  breast cancer  risk by the Women 's Health Initiative . TSEC is hypothesized to provide the benefits of estrogen-alone therapy , with an improved  tolerability profile  because the SERM component can make possible the elimination of progestin . The objective of this review was to critically evaluate the evidence from the reports published to date on the use of  bazedoxifene (  a  third-generation SERM )  in  combination with conjugated estrogens  in postmenopausal women . The conclusion is that effectively , the combination of  bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens  may be a promising alternative to  hormone therapy  for the prevention of  osteoporosis  and the treatment of  postmenopausal symptoms  in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women."

"4QUESTION Does  motor imagery training  improve measures of  balance , mobility and falls  in  older adults without a neurological condition  ? DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials . PARTICIPANTS  Adults aged at least 60 years and without a neurological condition .  INTERVENTION Three or more  sessions of motor imagery training .  OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes were  balance measures ( such as single leg stance and Berg Balance scale ) and mobility measures ( such as gait speed and the Timed Up and Go test ) . Falls  were a secondary outcome measure . Risk of bias was evaluated using the PEDro Scale , and overall quality of evidence was assessed using the Grade s of Research , Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach . RESULTS  Twelve trials including 356 participants were included in the systematic review and 10 trials ( 316 participants ) were included in  the  meta-analyses  .  All trials included either apparently healthy participants or older adults after orthopaedic surgery .  There was evidence that motor imagery training can significantly  improve balance  ( SMD 1.03 , 95 % CI 0.25 to 1.82 ) ,  gait speed  ( MD 0.13 m/s , 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.22 ) and  Timed Up and Go  ( MD 1.64 seconds , 95 % CI 0.79 to 2.49 ) in older adults ; however , the quality of evidence was very low to low . No data regarding  falls  were identified .   Motor imagery training  improves  balance and mobility  in  older adults who do not have a neurological condition .  These results suggest that  motor imagery training  could be an adjunct to st and ard physiotherapy care in  older  adults , although it is unclear whether or not the effects are clinical ly worthwhile .

sRituximab is the first antibody-based therapy approved in cancer . The role of this treatment for  non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma  has evolved significantly since its introduction . We aim ed to systematic ally review the literature on  rituximab  in  non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma  and provide consensus guidelines as to the rational use of this agent . Vali date d methodology from the Cancer Care Ontario Program in Evidence -Based Care was applied . A comprehensive literature search was completed by  review  ers  from the Hematology Disease Site Group of Cancer Care Ontario .  Data were abstract ed from r and omized controlled trials of   rituximab-containing regimens  for patients with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Twenty-three r and omized controlled trials  ( RCTs ) of   rituximab-based  therapy  were analyzed . Consistent and clinical ly important benefits in  progression-free and overall survival  and were seen in the following setting s : ( 1 ) addition of  rituximab  to  combination chemotherapy  for initial treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other aggressive B-cell lymphomas ; ( 2 ) addition of  rituximab  to  combination chemotherapy  for initial and subsequent treatment of follicular lymphoma and other indolent B-cell lymphomas ; and ( 3 ) use of  rituximab alone  as extended maintenance therapy in  patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas who have responded to initial treatment .  The consensus opinion of the Hematology Disease Site Group is that  rituximab  is recommended for these indications.

"tThis article proposes a number of recommendations for the treatment of   generalized social phobia   , based on a systematic literature review and meta- analysis . An optimal treatment regimen would include a  combination of medication and psychotherapy  , along with an  assertive clinical management program .  For medications ,  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  and  dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors  are first-line choices based on their efficacy and tolerability profiles . The  nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor , phenelzine  , may be more potent than these two drug classes , but because of its food and drug interaction liabilities , its use should be restricted to patients not  responding to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or  serotonin-norepinephrine  reuptake inhibitors   .  There are other medication classes with demonstrated efficacy in  social phobia  (  benzodiazepines , antipsychotics , alpha-2-delta lig and  s  )  , but due to limited published clinical trial data and the potential for dependence and withdrawal issues with benzodiazepines , it is unclear how best to incorporate these drugs into treatment regimens . There are very few clinical trials on the use of combined medications .   Cognitive behavior therapy   appears to be more  effective  than other evidence -based psychological techniques , and its effects appear to be more enduring than those of  pharmacotherapy .  There is some evidence , albeit limited to certain drug classes , that the combination of   medication  and  cognitive behavior  therapy  may be more  effective  than either strategy used alone .   Generalized social phobia   is a chronic disorder , and many patients will require long-term support and treatment."
"sComposite  resin  is used extensively for restoration of  teeth with vital pulps .  Although cell culture studies have disclosed harmful effects on pulpal cells , any untoward clinical effects , manifest as adverse pulpal responses , have yet to be determined . This study comprises a systematic review , design ed to address the question of whether the risk of endodontic complications is greater with   composite resin restorations   than with   other restorative material s   , such as   amalgam .   The study methodology involved ( i ) formulation of the research question , ( ii ) construction and conduct of an extensive literature search with ( iii ) interpretation and assessment of the retrieved literature . A search of the medical data base PubMed was complemented with a search of the Controlled Trials Register ( CENTRAL ) . The initial search yielded  1043 publications  , the abstract s of which were read independently by the authors . After additional search es ,  10 studies were included in the  review . In all the included studies , the level of evidence was assessed as low . No conclusions could therefore be drawn . The included studies reported few , if any ,  endodontic complications .  Little or no differences emerged between  teeth  restored with   composite resins   and those  restored with  amalgam .   To determine whether  composite resin restorations  of teeth with vital pulps are associated with an increased  risk for development of endodontic complications such as apical periodontitis  , further evidence is needed , from well-constructed studies with a large number of participants."
">Purpose The aim of the current meta- analysis was to investigate the effect of  increasing dietary ALA intake  on the  blood concentration of inflammatory markers  including  tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP )  ,  soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 )  , and  soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sVCAM-1 )   in adults .  Methods After a systemic search on PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane library and bibliographies of relevant articles ,  25 r and omized controlled trials that met  the inclusion criteria were identified . Results No significant effect of  dietary ALA supplementation  was observed  on TNF  ( SMD : −0.03 , 95 % CI −0.36 to 0.29 )  , IL-6  ( SMD : −0.17 , 95 % CI −0.46 to 0.12  ) , CRP  ( SMD : −0.06 , 95 % CI −0.24 to 0.12  ) , sICAM-1  ( SMD : −0.06 , 95 % CI −0.26 to 0.13 ) ,  and sVCAM-1  ( SMD : −0.24 , 95 % CI −0.56 to 0.09 ) . Subgroup analysis revealed that increasing  dietary  ALA tends to  elevate CRP concentration   in healthy subjects .  However , the null effect  of ALA supplementation  on  other inflammatory markers  was not changed in various subgroups , indicating that the results are stable . Meta-regression results revealed a negative relationship  between the effect size on CRP  and  its baseline  concentration . No significant  publication  bias was observed for  all inflammatory  markers as suggested by funnel plot and Begg ’s test . Conclusion Our meta- analysis did not find any beneficial effect of  ALA supplementation   on reducing inflammatory markers including TNF , IL-6 , CRP , sICAM-1 , and sVCAM-1  . However ,  in healthy subjects   ,  ALA supplementation might  increase CRP concentration ."
"yPioglitazone is one of thiazolidinedione derivatives , which stimulates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and improves glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity . A recent systematic review and meta- analysis showed that  pioglitazone  therapy was associated with a lower risk of  major adverse cardiovascular events  in  patients with pre-diabetes and diabetes .  Further , in a cohort study of  patients with type 2 diabetes  ,  pioglitazone  therapy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of  all-cause mortality .  Despite these beneficial effects , the meta- analysis showed that  pioglitazone  therapy had higher risks of  heart failure , bone fractures , edema and weight gain .  To find out the efficacy and safety of the low-dose ( 7.5 mg/day  ) pioglitazone  therapy , we review ed the dose-response of  pioglitazone  on favorable effects and adverse effects due to  pioglitazone  , by search ing the reports on effects of daily dose of 7.5 mg and /or 15 mg and /or 30 mg of  pioglitazone .  The low-dose  pioglitazone  therapy may show the same degree of improvements in  glucose and lipid metabolism , fatty liver , insulin resistance , and adiponectin  as the st and ard- and high-dose  pioglitazone  therapy . Furthermore , the low-dose  pioglitazone  therapy may also show less adverse effects on  weight gain , edema and heart failure  as compared with the st and ard- and high-dose  pioglitazone  therapy."
"mThis systematic review examined the characteristics of published cost-effectiveness analyses of   inpatient smoking cessation programs   and assessed the method ological quality of the selected studies , to provide policymakers with economic evidence for this type of program . A literature search was undertaken using a relevant data base by three investigators . Only full economic evaluations with results in the form of the incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio  (  ICER )  were included . Costs were adjusted to 2016 US dollars using the Gross Domestic Product deflator and purchasing power parities . The British Medical Journal checklist was utilized to appraise the method ological quality of the included studies .  Nine articles were ultimately selected .   The  inpatient smoking cessation programs   appeared to be a  highly cost-effective  intervention according to the recommended cost-effectiveness thresholds by the World Health Organization or individual studies . The  highest ICERs  among the selected studies were $ 5593 per  additional quit  , $ 10,550 per life  year gained  , and $ 5680 per quality  -adjusted life year gained  . This study provides robust evidence supporting the  cost-effectiveness  of smoking cessation programs for  hospitalized patients .  In addition , the results indicated that the  degree of cost-effectiveness  of the inpatient smoking cessation program might not be related to either the components of the program or method ological variations in the cost-effectiveness analysis . Policymakers should provide hospitals with re sources and strong incentives to promote wider implementation of the smoking cessation program."

"eIn the report Crossing the Quality Chasm ( 1 ) , the Institute of Medicine called attention to the  poor quality of health care in the United States .  The Institute identified numerous factors contributing to poor quality , including the structure of the present health care payment system . The Institute found that , for certain clinical situations , health care payment arrangements may actually produce disincentives for quality . The largely untapped potential of the health care payment system to change  physician and health care system behavior  has stimulated interest in both the scientific literature ( 2 , 3 ) and the popular press ( 4 - 6 ) for linking payments to performance on quality measures . Several  health plans  ( 3 , 7 ) and the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  are using  explicit financial incentives for quality  ( 8 , 9 ) . The effectiveness of these programs has not been systematic ally evaluated , and despite enthusiasm about the potential for aligning financial incentives with high- quality health care , many fundamental questions about their optimal design , effectiveness , and implementation remain unanswered . For example , what types of clinical conditions or health care services should be the target of  financial incentives to  improve quality : chronic diseases , acute care , or preventive care services ? How effective ( and  cost-effective  ) are  financial  incentives for quality ? What are the optimum magnitude , frequency , and duration of financial incentives for quality ? Should we reward achievement of an absolute threshold of performance , improvement over baseline performance , payment for each instance of a service regardless of the overall performance , or some combination of these ? To whom should such incentives be directed : the patient ( 10 ) , the health care provider , the provider group or hospital , or all of these parties ? What types  of quality measures  should be rewarded : processes of care , outcomes , or both ( 11 ) ? Are  financial incentives  for  not providing inappropriate care  ( such as antibiotics for uncomplicated acute upper respiratory illnesses ) effective ? What is the optimum package of nonfinancial interventions ( if any ) to include with  financial incentives  for quality , for example ,  audit and feedback , recognition , clinical reminders , academic detailing  , or  information technology support  ( 12 , 13 ) ? Can we expect the effect of  financial incentives  to persist after they are stopped ? Because any effective intervention will have some unanticipated effects , will important patient care activities that are not rewarded financially be neglected ? The purpose of this paper is to assess the relationship between  explicit financial incentives  and the  provision of high- quality health care  by systematic ally review ing empirical studies . Because the evidence regarding the relationship between the  financial  incentives embedded in fee-for-service and capitation arrangements and the quality of health care has been thoroughly review ed in previous work ( 14 ) , we focused our review on literature that addresses explicit financial rewards for improving health care quality . Methods Study Identification and Selection We conducted a systematic search of the  English- language  literature  in PubMed  to find  articles published between 1 January 1980 and 14 November 2005  whose main objective was to assess the use of  explicit financial incentives  to improve  health care quality .  Our search algorithms combined Medical Subject Heading ( MeSH ) terms and text words . We used the following MeSH terms : quality of health care ; insurance , health , reimbursement ; physician incentive plans ; and  reimbursement  , incentive  .  We design ated words and word phrases as text word terms in our search algorithms to ensure that all words in the title , abstract , MeSH terms , and MeSH subheadings that matched our words were extracted from the electronic data base ( 15 ) . We indicated the following words and phrases as text word terms in our search :  quality , quality of care , payment , payment system , reimbursement , risk adjustment , physicians , financial incentives , financing , incentive , health care , bonus , insurance , performance-based , and fees .  We review ed additional publications found in bibliographies of retrieved articles , and we contacted experts about missing or unpublished studies . We included  only English- language studies that  reported original data . We were interested in identifying studies of  explicit financial incentives  directed at individual physicians and provider groups , as well as  incentives  at the level of the payment system , such as  performance-based contracting .  Eligible studies assessed the use of   financial incentives   as the independent variable and a  measure of quality  ( such as immunization or cancer screening ) as the dependent variable .  Quality of care  was defined as the degree to which health care services for individuals and population s increase the likelihood of  desired health outcomes  and are consistent with current professional knowledge ( 16 ) . The domains of quality were defined as  access to care , structure of care , process of care , outcomes of care , and patient experience of care .  Access to care is the patient 's attainment of timely and appropriate health care . Structure of care is a feature of a health care organization or clinician relevant to the provision of health care . Process of care is a health care service provided to or on behalf of a patient . Outcome  of  care is a health state of a patient result ing from health care . Experience of care is the individual 's or population 's report concerning health care ( 17 ) . Study Inclusion Criteria Studies were eligible for review if they were original reports providing empirical results and assessed the relationship between the  explicit financial incentive  and a quantitative measure of health care quality ( 17 ) . Review ers assessed articles in an unblinded , st and ardized manner ( 18 , 19 ) . At least 2 authors review ed the title and keywords of articles ' PubMed citations to identify empirical studies . At least 2 authors then review ed the abstract s of those studies to determine eligibility . All authors then abstract ed and review ed the full articles that addressed the objective of the review . When there were discrepancies , all authors met to discuss and reach consensus about article inclusion . There were no instances of disagreement in which consensus could not be reached . We  excluded eligible studies if there was no concurrent comparison group or if there was no baseline , preintervention analysis of the groups on the quality measure .  Concurrent comparison groups are important because some studies of quality may show dramatic improvement over time but no statistically significant differences between intervention and comparison groups . We included r and omized , controlled trials and controlled before- and -after studies . Because of the paucity of literature on this topic , we also included observational studies that , although not study ing a specific intervention , nevertheless examined the relationship between  financial incentives  and quality in a cross-sectional analysis . We categorized the results of each study according to the effect of the  financial incentive  on the measure or  measures of quality .  Positive studies were those for which all  measures of quality  demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with the  financial incentive .  Studies with partial effects showed improved  performance  on some  measures of quality  but not others . Negative studies were those for which all  measures of quality  demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in  quality  with the  financial incentive .  The final category was for studies demonstrating no effect . We used a checklist for method ologic quality published by Downs and Black ( 20 ) . After we assessed the checklist for each article , a grade of 1 ( poor ) to 4 ( excellent ) was assigned to each included article . We did not use formal meta-analytic techniques because the included studies used many different measures of effect . Role of the Funding Sources The Veterans Health Administration , the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , the American Heart Association , and the National Institutes of Health supported this study but had no role in design , conduct , or reporting or in the decision to su bmi t the paper for publication . Results Search Results Our search for eligible studies is summarized in the Figure . Most of the articles were descriptions and not evaluations .  Sixteen articles ( 21 - 36 ) that met  the eligibility criteria were subsequently excluded because a concurrent comparison group was not analyzed or groups were not compared at baseline on the quality indicator ( Table 1 ) . The Appendix Table summarizes the  17 included  studies . Two studies reported the effect of payment-system  level financial incentives  ( 37 , 38 ) . The remaining 15 studies evaluated  financial incentives  directed to the provider group ( 39 - 47 ) or individual physician ( 48 - 53 ) . Appendix Table . Articles Identified as Assessing  Explicit Financial Incentives  and Health Care Quality from a Systematic Review of the Literature after Applying Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Figure .  Studies published between 1 January 1980 and 14 November 2005 and evaluated for inclusion in the systematic review of  explicit financial incentives for health  care  quality   . Table 1 . Excluded Articles and Reason for Exclusion  Financial Incentives  at the Payment System Level We found 2 studies of  financial incentives  provided at the payment system level ( 37 , 38 ) . For example , Norton ( 37 ) studied the effectiveness of an incentive to  improve access  to  health care  for  nursing home patients with debilitating acute and chronic conditions .  The program included  incentives  to  admit  severely dependent patients   ,  incentives  for   attainment  of health status goals  , and an incentive to  discharge clinical ly appropriate patients .  The intervention sites  admitted statistically significantly more  severely ill patients   than  nursing homes  in the  control group .  Despite the."

"yThis article is a systematic review of the literature on  divided attention assessment  inclusive of a cognitive and motor task ( balance or gait ) for use in  concussion management .  The systematic review drew from published papers listed in PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE and CINAHL data bases . The search identified 19 empirical research papers meeting the inclusion criteria . Study results were considered for the  psychometric properties  of the paradigms , the influence of divided attention on measures of  cognition  and  postural control  and the comparison of   divided attention task  outcomes  between  individuals with concussion and healthy controls ( all sample s were age 17 years or older ) .  The review highlights that the  reliability  of the tasks under a  divided attention  paradigm presented ranges from low to high ( ICC : 0.1–0.9 ) ; however , only 3/19 articles included  psychometric information . Response times  are greater ,  gait strategies  are less  efficient  , and  postural control deficits  are greater in  concussed participants  compared with healthy controls both immediately and for some period following concussive injury , specifically under divided attention conditions .  Dual  task assessment  s  in some cases were more  reliable  than  single task assessment s  and may be better able to detect lingering effects following concussion . Few of the studies have been replicated and applied across various age groups . A key limitation of these studies is that many include laboratory and time-intensive  measures .  Future research is needed to refine a time and cost efficient  divided attention assessment  paradigm , and more work is needed in  younger ( pre-teens ) population s  where the application may be of greatest utility."

"hOBJECTIVE  Advanced practice physiotherapists ( APPs )  , also known as  extended scope physiotherapists  , provide a new model of service delivery for  musculoskeletal ( MSK ) disorders .  Research to date has largely focused on health service efficiencies , with less emphasis on patient outcomes . The present systematic review aim ed to identify the   patient-reported outcome measures  ( PROMs )  being utilized by  APPs .  METHOD A wide search strategy was employed , including the PubMed , Embase , CINAHL , CENTRAL and PEDro data bases , to identify studies relating to  PROMs  utilized by   APPs  in MSK healthcare setting s.  PROMs identified were classified into predetermined outcome domains , with additional context ual data extracted . RESULTS Of  the initial 12,302 studies , 38 met the inclusion criteria .  These involved APPs across different setting s , utilizing 72 different PROMs and most commonly capturing :  Patient Satisfaction , Quality of Life ( QoL ) , Functional Status , and Pain ;  and , less frequently :  Global Status ( i.e. overall improvement ) , Psychological Well-Being , Work ability , and Healthcare Consumption and Costs .  The quality of the PROMs varied greatly , with Satisfaction most commonly measured utilizing non-st and ardized locally-devised tools ; the  EuroQol five-dimensions question naire ( EuroQoL-5D )  and  36-Item Short-Form ( SF-36 )  cited most frequently to capture  QoL ;  and the  Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS )  to  capture Pain .  No key measure was identified to capture  Functional Status  , with 15 different tools utilized .  APPs utilized a multiplicity of PROMs across a range of MSK disorders . The present review will act as an important re source , informing the selection of outcomes for MSK disorders , with a view to greater st and ardization of outcome measurement in MSK clinical practice , service evaluation and research."
"sThe aim of this systematic review was to investigate the task specificity of  strength training programs  for  walking in neurologic rehabilitation . Nine electronic data bases  were search ed from conception to October 2012 for r and omized controlled trials that used  strength training  to improve walking in  adult neurologic population s.  The search identified  25 r and omized controlled trials that  investigated the efficacy of  strength  training  to improve  walking  in people with a variety of neurologic conditions .  The results revealed that despite significant strength gains , many studies failed to show a significant  improvement in walking capacity .  Most studies did not include exercises relating to all three main power events important for walking .  Strength testing and strengthening exercises  were prioritized for the knee extensors and flexors , despite their relatively minor role in human walking .  Strengthening exercises  performed in the neurologic population are not specific to the main muscle groups responsible for the power generation required for walking . There is a predisposition for  strength testing and strengthening exercises  to focus on the knee flexors and extensors despite their relatively minor role during walking . Further consideration of the specificity of strength training may provide greater translation of  strength gains  to improved walking outcomes."

"nCognitive dysfunction is of clinical significance and exerts longst and ing implication on patients ׳ function . Pharmacological and  non-pharmacological  treatments of cognitive dysfunction are emerging . This review evaluates  pharmacological and non-pharmacological  treatments of cognitive impairment primarily in the domains of memory , attention , processing speed and executive function in  clinical depression . A total of 35 studies were retrieved from Pubmed , PsycInfo and Scopus  after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria . Results show that various classes of antidepressants exert improving effects on  cognitive function  across several cognitive domains . Specifically , studies suggest that SSRIs , the  SSRE tianeptine ,  the  SNRI duloxetine , vortioxetine  and  other antidepressants such  as  bupropion and moclobemide  may exert certain improving effects on  cognitive function  in depression , such as in  learning and memory and executive function  . Class-specific cognitive domains or specific dose-response relationships were not identified yet . The few non-pharmacological studies conducted employing  cognitive orientated treatments and cognitive remediation therapy  show promising results for the improvement  of cognitive impairment  in depression . However , several method ological constraints of studies limit generalizability of the results and caution the interpretation . Future direction should consider the development of a neuropsychological consensus cognitive battery to support the discovery , clinical assessment , comparison of studies and registration of new agents in clinical depression."
"sBackground  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD )  is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide . The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex and multifactorial . There is growing evidence that altered gut microbiota plays a key role in NAFLD progression .  Probiotics/synbiotics  , by modifying gut microbiota , may be a promising treatment choice for NAFLD management . Aim The aim of this study was to study the effect of  probiotics/synbiotics  on various laboratory and radiographic parameters in NAFLD management . Material s and methods A systematic review and meta- analysis were carried out according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-analyses guidelines . We search ed PubMed , Medline , and Google Scholar for r and omized-controlled trials that studied the role of  probiotics/synbiotics  in NAFLD . The primary outcome was  change in baseline alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase  in the treatment arm . We used a r and om-effects model and inverse variance for the continuous data to estimate the mean difference ( MD ) and the st and ard mean difference ( SMD ) in RevMan Version 5.3 . Results We included  12 r and omized-controlled trials for analysis  . The intervention arm , which comprised  of the probiotic and /or the synbiotic arm  , showed a significant  improvement in alanine aminotransferase levels  , MD=–13.93 , confidence interval (CI)=–20.20 to –7.66 , P value of less than 0.0001 , I2=92 %  and aspartate aminotransferase  levels MD=−11.45 , CI=−15.15 to −7.74 , P value of less than 0.00001 , I2=91 % . There was a  reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels  in the intervention arm , SMD=–0.68 , CI=–1.10 to –0.26 , P value of 0.001 , I2=0 % .  The liver fibrosis score  improved in the intervention arm , MD=–0.71 , CI=–0.81 to –0.61 , P value less than 0.00001 , I2=0 %  . Conclusion Probiotic/synbiotic use   improves aminotransaminase levels and reduces proinflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein  and  liver  fibrosis in NAFLD patients."
" Psychological treatments  have a small effect in  reducing parent- , teacher- and observer-rated CD problems   in children and adolescents  with clinical CD problems/diagnosis . There is not enough evidence to support one specific psychological treatment over another . Future studies should investigate the influence of participant characteristics ( e.g. age of CD onset ) , use more homogeneous outcome measures and allow better evaluation of study quality . Many reports failed to provide detailed information to allow optimization of psychological treatment strategies."
" One can not ignore the positive findings reported in most trials . However the scientific evidence is insufficient because of the poor method ological quality , the absence of an adequate statistical analysis , and the absence , for the patient , of most essential outcome measures  ( pain , self assessed function , quality of life )  . Therefore , the noted "" positive findings "" should be viewed with caution . Because of the method ological flaws an answer about the  apparent effectiveness of  balneotherapy   can not be provided at this moment . A large , method ological sound trial is needed."
"sMoxibustion , an  acupuncture-like  intervention , is increasingly used in the management of  rheumatic conditions .  The aim of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the trials testing effectiveness of  moxibustion  for  major rheumatic conditions . Fourteen data bases were  search ed from their inception through May 2010 , without language restriction . R and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) were included if  moxibustion  was used as the sole treatment or as a part of a combination therapy with conventional drugs for rheumatic conditions . Cochrane criteria were used to assess the risk of bias .  A total of 14 RCTs met our inclusion criteria .  All were of low method ological quality . The meta- analysis of the eight RCTs suggested  favorable effects of  moxibustion   on  the response rate  compared with  conventional drug therapy  [ n = 631 ; relative risk ( RR ) , 1.13 ; 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) , 1.02 to 1.26 ; P = 0.02 ] with high heterogeneity ( I2 = 58 % ) . A subgroup analysis showed  significant effects of  moxibustion  on the RR  compared with drug therapy in  patients  with knee osteoarthritis , whereas it failed to do so in rheumatoid arthritis . The results of meta- analysis of the six RCTs suggested  favorable effects of  moxibustion  plus drug therapy on the response rate  compared with   conventional  drug therapy  alone ( n = 433 ; RR , 1.25 ; 95 % CIs , 1.09 to 1.43 ; P = 0.02 ) with high heterogeneity ( I2 = 62 % ) . This systematic review fails to provide conclusive evidence for the  effectiveness  of  moxibustion  compared with drug therapy in rheumatic conditions . The total number of RCTs included in this review and their method ological quality were low . These limitations make it difficult to draw firm conclusions."
"yBACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE ( S ) Global prevalence of  type 2 diabetes ( T2D )  is very high and is currently growing alarmingly . With respect to recent research ers ' attention to the potential role of herbal  medicine  in disease prevention and management , the present meta- analysis review investigates the effectiveness of  Nigella sativa ( N. sativa )  , a popular herb , in T2D . METHODS Literature search was conducted covering PubMed  / Medline , Scopus , and Cochrane Registry of Clinical Trials up to February 2017  to obtain the relevant published intervention studies . Study selection , quality rating and data extraction of studies were investigated by two independent review ers . Heterogeneity was assessed using I-squared ( I2 ) statistics test . Subgroup analysis was done to assess type of  N. sativa  supplement as source of heterogeneity . Effect sizes of eligible studies were pooled using STATA software version 12 ( STATA corp , College Station , TX , USA ) . RESULTS  Seven trials were included  in the meta-  analysis of glycemic and serum lipid profile end points  .  Supplementation with N. sativa  significantly  improved fasting blood sugar (  FBS  )  [ -17.84mg/dl , 95 % CI : -21.19 to -14.49 , p<0.001 ] , HbA1c [ -0.71 % , 95 % CI : -1.04 to -0.39 , p<0.001 ] ,  total-cholesterol (  TC  )  [ WMD : -22.99mg/dl , 95 % CI : -32.16 to -13.83 , p<0.001 ] and  LDL-cholesterol (  LDL-c  )  [ -22.38mg/dl , 95 % CI : -33.60 to -11.15 , p<0.001 ] . The overall effects  for triglyceride ( TG )  [ -6.80mg/dl , 95 % CI : -33.59 to 19.99 , p=0.61 ] and  HDL-cholesterol ( HDL-c  ) [ 0.37mg/dl , 95 % CI : -1.59 to 2.33 , p=0.71 ] were insignificant . Subgroup analysis revealed significant  reduction on TG   with N. sativa  seed oil [ -14.8mg/dl , 95 % CI : -23.1 to -6.5 , p<0.001 ] ,  while TG  was increased with seed powder [ 29.4mg/dl , 95 % CI : 16.9 - 42.0 , p<0.001 ] . All measures , but HbA1c , showed no evidence of publication bias .  Although , the meta- analysis conducted included a few number of studies , but has shown promising results on the effectiveness of  N.  sativa on  glucose homeostasis and serum lipids .  Current findings suggest  N. sativa  supplementation a suitable choice in managing the complications of T2D , although future research es are necessary."
"eInfant formulae are increasingly supplemented with  probiotics , prebiotics , or synbiotics  despite uncertainties regarding their efficacy . The present article , developed by the Committee on Nutrition of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology , and Nutrition , systematic ally review s published evidence related to the safety and health effects of the administration of  formulae supplemented with probiotics and /or prebiotics  compared with unsupplemented formulae  .  Studies in which  probiotics/prebiotics  were not administered during the manufacturing process , but thereafter , for example in capsules , the contents of which were supplemented to infant formula or feeds , were excluded . On the basis of this review , available scientific data suggest that the administration of currently evaluated  probiotic- and /or prebiotic-supplemented formula  to  healthy infants  does not raise  safety concerns  with regard to  growth  and  adverse effects .  The safety and clinical effects of 1 product should not be extrapolated to other products . At present , there is insufficient data to recommend the routine use of  probiotic- and /or prebiotic-supplemented formulae .  The Committee considers that the supplementation of formula with  probiotics and /or prebiotics  is an important field of research . There is a need in this field for well- design ed and carefully conducted r and omised controlled trials , with relevant inclusion /exclusion criteria and adequate sample sizes . These studies should use vali date d  clinical outcome measures  to assess the effects of  probiotic and /or prebiotic supplementation  of formulae . Such trials should also define the optimal doses and intake duration s , as well as provide more information about the  long-term safety of  probiotics and /or prebiotics .   Because most of the trials were company funded , independent trials , preferentially financed jointly by national/governmental/European Union bodies and other international organisations , would be desirable."
"dAbstract  Fermented formulas  , i.e. , those fermented with  lactic acid-producing bacteria  during the production process and not containing significant amounts of viable bacteria in the final product , are widely available in many countries . Our aim was to systematic ally review published evidence related to the safety and health effects of the administration of  fermented infant formulas compared with st and ard infant formulas .  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , and EMBASE data bases and major pediatric conference proceedings were search ed . Five r  and  omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) involving  1326 infants met the inclusion criteria .  Compared with  st and ard formula  , the use of  fermented formula  result ed in a similar  weight gain and length gain  during the study period . Data from one RCT , albeit large , suggest the effectiveness of fermented formula in preventing  and treating acute diarrhea .  Fermented formula has the potential to reduce some  , albeit not well-defined , digestive symptoms .  Current evidence does not support the use of fermented formula for preventing  cow ’s milk allergy .  Conclusion : Limited available evidence suggests that the use of  fermented infant formula  , compared with the use of  st and ard infant formula  , does not offer clear additional benefits , although some benefit on  gastrointestinal symptoms  can not be excluded .

" The effects  of fixed-dose combination therapy  on  all-cause mortality or ASCVD events  are uncertain . A limited number of trials reported these outcomes , and the included trials were primarily design ed to observe changes in ASCVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events , which may partially explain the observed differences in risk factors that were not translated into differences in clinical outcomes among the included trials .  Fixed-dose combination therapy  is associated with modest increases in adverse  events  compared with placebo , active comparator , or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen . Ongoing , longer-term trials of fixed-dose  combination therapy  will help demonstrate whether short-term changes in risk factors might be maintained and lead to expected differences in clinical events based on these changes."
"sINTRODUCTION In recent years , several  non-specialist mediated interventions  have been developed and tested to address problematic symptoms associated with  autism .  These can be implemented with a fraction of cost required for  specialist delivered interventions .  This review represents a robust evidence of clinical effectiveness of these interventions in improving the social , motor and communication deficits among  children with autism .  METHODS An electronic search was conducted in  eight academic data bases from their inception to 31st December 2018 .  A total of  31 r and omized controlled trials were published post-2010  while only  2 were  published prior to it . Outcomes pertaining to  communication , social skills and caregiver-child relationship  were meta-analyzed when reported in > 2 studies . RESULTS A significant improvement was noted in  child distress  ( SMD = 0.55 )  , communication  ( SMD = 0.23 )  , expressive language  ( SMD = 0.47 )  , joint engagement  ( SMD = 0.63 ) ,  motor skills  ( SMD = 0.25 ) ,  parental distress  ( SMD = 0.33 )  parental self-efficacy  ( SMD = 0.42 )  parent-child relationship  ( SMD = 0.67  ) repetitive behaviors  ( SMD = 0.33 ) ,  self-regulation  ( SMD = 0.54 )  , social skills  ( SMD = 0.53 )  symptom severity  ( SMD = 0.44 )  and visual reception  ( SMD = 0.29 ) .   Non-specialist mediated interventions  for autism spectrum disorder demonstrate effectiveness across a range of outcomes for children with autism and their caregivers."
" : Only a limited number of studies could be pooled in the meta-analyses . This limited the power of the meta- analysis to provide conclusions about  efficacy  and safety . However , there is evidence that adding  testosterone to HT  has a beneficial effect on  sexual function  in  postmenopausal women .  There was a reduction in  HDL cholesterol  associated with the addition of  testosterone  to the HT regimens . The meta- analysis combined studies using different  testosterone  regimens . It is , therefore , difficult to estimate the effect of  testosterone  on  sexual function  in association with any individual hormone treatment regimen."

" Few studies have examined the  reliability and validity  of  accelerometers  for measuring  SB   in older adults .  Studies to date suggest that the criteria research ers use for classifying an epoch as sedentary instead of as non-wear time ( e.g. , the non-wear algorithm used ) may need to be different for older adults than for younger adults . The required number of hours and days of wear for valid estimates of  SB  in older adults was not clear from studies to date . More older-adult-specific validation studies of  accelerometers  are needed , to inform future guidelines on the appropriate criteria to use for analysis of data from different accelerometer br and s .

"gThe association of  atrial fibrillation ( AF )  with an increased risk of stroke and heart failure makes it a serious health condition . Many people have AF and do not know it , and its prevalence continues to rise in parallel with the growing numbers of people living with obesity and cardiac risk factors.1,2 These elements , along with the proliferation of devices capable of monitoring the heart rhythm , have led many physicians to promote  screening for AF.3  The hypothesis is that early detection would allow treatment with anticoagulation , which would then deliver a net clinical benefit . Screening , however , is not a sure win . Two pioneers of public health , Drs Wilson and Jungner , wrote a half-century ago : “ in theory ... screening is an admirable method of combating disease, ... but in practice , there are snags.”4(p7 ) A systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) published in the current issue of JAMA,5 conducted in support of the USPSTF Recommendation Statement published in the same issue,6 found the current evidence insufficient to assess the balance of  benefits and  harms of screening  for AF with electrocardiography ( ECG )  ( I statement ) . We concur with this conclusion and exp and on many of the “ snags ” of AF screening."
"yBackground : Sleep disorders are commonly associated with acute and chronic use of alcohol and with abstinence . To date , there are four approved drugs to treat alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) :  disulfiram , acamprosate , naltrexone , and nalmefene .  These AUD therapies reduce the craving and risk of relapse into heavy drinking , but little is known about their effect on sleep . As recent evidence s indicate a crucial role of sleep disorders in AUD , cl aim ing that sleep problems may trigger alcohol abuse and relapses , it is fundamental to clarify the impact of those drugs on the sleep quality of  AUD patients .  This systematic review aims to answer the question : how does the pharmacotherapy for AUD affect sleep ? Methods : We search ed PubMed , Embase , CINAHL Plus , Cochrane , and Scopus using  sleep- and AUD pharmacotherapy-related  keywords . The articles included were appraised using the CASP checklists , and the risk of bias was assessed following the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool . Finally , we pooled  sleep  outcomes in a meta- analysis to measure the overall effect . Results and Conclusion :  We included 26 studies :  only three studies focused on  sleep  as a main outcome , two with polysomnography ( objective measurement ) , and one with  subjective self-reported sleep  , while all the other studies reported sleep problems among the adverse effects ( subjective report ) . The only study available on  disulfiram  showed reduced  REM sleep .   Acamprosate  showed no/little effect on  self-reported sleep  but improved  sleep continuity and architecture  measured by  polysomnography .  The two opioidergic drugs  naltrexone  and  nalmefene  had mainly detrimental effect on  sleep  , giving increased  insomnia and /or somnolence  compared with  placebo  , although not always significant . The meta- analysis confirmed significantly increased  somnolence and insomnia  in the  naltrexone  group , compared with the  placebo .  Overall , the currently available evidence s show more  sleep problems  with the  opioidergic drugs (  especially  naltrexone )  , while  acamprosate  seems to be well tolerated or even beneficial .  Acamprosate  might be a more suitable choice when  patients with AUD  report  sleep problems .  Due to the paucity of information available , and with the majority of results being subjective , more research on this topic is needed to further inform the clinical practice , ideally with more objective measurements such as polysomnography."
"eBackground It is important to obtain greater insight into  health-related quality of life ( HRQL )  of  injury patients  in order to document people 's pathways to recovery and to quantify the impact of injury on population health over time . We performed a systematic review of studies measuring HRQL in  general injury population s  with a generic health state measure to summarize existing knowledge . Methods  Injury studies ( 1995 - 2009 )  were identified with main inclusion criteria being the use of a  generic health status measure  and not being restricted to one specific type of injury . Articles were collated by study design ,  HRQL  instrument used , timing of assessment ( s ) , predictive variables and ability to detect change over time . Results  Forty one studies met  inclusion criteria , using 24 different generic  HRQL  and functional status measures ( most used were SF-36 , FIM , GOS , EQ-5D ) . The majority of the studies used a longitudinal design , but with different lengths and timings of follow-up ( mostly 6 , 12 , and 24 months ) . Different generic health measures were able to discriminate between the health status of subgroups and picked up changes in health status between discharge and 12 month follow-up . Most studies reported  high prevalences of health problems  within the first year after injury . The twelve studies that reported  HRQL utility scores  showed considerable but  incomplete recovery  in the first year after discharge . Conclusion This systematic review demonstrates large variation in use of HRQL instruments , study population s , and assessment time points used in studies measuring HRQL of  general injury population  s. This variability impedes comparison of HRQL summary scores between studies and prevented formal meta-analyses aim ing to quantify and improve precision of the impact of injury on population health over time."
" Overall , there are sparse data informing the use of antihypertensive agents in  children  , with outcomes reported limited to  blood pressure  and not end organ damage . The most data are available for c and esartan , for which there is low- quality evidence of a modest lowering effect on  blood pressure .  We did not find evidence of a consistent dose response relationship for escalating doses of  angiotensin receptor blockers , calcium channel blockers  or  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors .  All agents appear safe , at least in the short term."
"sThe purpose of present study was to analyze the magnitude of the effect-size in the assessment of the  cognitive status of population s over 60 years of age .  The search strategy included PubMed , B-on , Ebsco , Ebsco Health , Scielo , Eric , Lilacs and Sportd iscus data bases . Only  observational , cohort and cross-sectional studies  were included in the meta- analysis . The central descriptors were elderly-frail , older adults , cognition and geriatric assessment and other additional terms . After applying the additional search criteria ,  12 manuscripts were selected from an initial universe of 1,078 identified .  When comparing the  mean cognitive profile scores  of the  participants  of the  pre-frail ( n = 11,265 ) and frail ( n = 2,460 ) groups  , significant statistical differences were found ( p<0,001 ) , with lower mean scores emerging in frail-group . The results showed that  cognitive decline  is strongly associated with frailty , being a probable main clinical outcome . In this sense , any strategy aim ed at mitigating or reversing the incidence of frailty with ageing should take into account that physical and cognitive frailty seem to have similar temporal trajectories."
" There was some evidence that  iron supplementation  improved  attention , concentration and IQ  , but this requires confirmation with well-powered , blinded , independently funded RCTs of at least one year 's duration in different  age groups including children , adolescents , adults and older people  , and across all levels of baseline iron status."
  Financial incentives  may be effective in changing  healthcare professional practice .  The evidence has serious method ological limitations and is also very limited in its completeness and generalisability . We found no evidence from review s that examined the effect of  financial incentives  on patient outcomes.
" These results make  alcohol  screening and  counseling  one of the highest-ranking preventive services among the 25 effective services evaluated using st and ardized methods .

"rThe metric of  disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs )  has become the global st and ard of measuring burden of disease . DALYs are comprised of years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of  healthy life  lost due to living with disability . In order to calculate the second part of the DALY equation , disease specific disability weights have to be established , i.e. measures for the decline of health associated with these disease states , which vary between zero for perfect health and one for death . Although these disability weights are key for estimating  DALYs  , there have not been many comprehensive studies with empirical determinations of them . This article describes a systematic review on the state of the art with respect to empirically determining  disability weights .  Based on this review , a multi- method approach is outlined , which has also been implemented in a US study to measure burden of  disease .  This approach involves the use of psychometric methodology as well as economic trade-off methods for determining the value of health states . It is conceptualized as a disaggregated approach , where the  disability weight  of any health state can be calculated if the attributes of this health state are known . The US study received the collaboration of experts from more than 20 institutes of the National Institutes of Health and of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . First results will be available by the end of this year."
" These findings suggest that the apps may not be suitable in meeting the complex needs associated with this condition . Further research is required to explore the value of apps for  children and young people with ADHD  and their families and , in particular , any positive role for apps in the management of ADHD in this age group . A systematic review on how technology can be used to engage this population and how it can be used to help them would be a useful way forward . This could be the platform to begin exploring the use of apps further."

"nExercise is a form of  physical activity ( PA ) . PA  is an important marker of health and quality of life in  older adults .  The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the effect of  exercise-based interventions  on an at least six-month follow up PA measure , and to describe the specific strategies implemented during the intervention to strengthen the sustainability of  PA  in  community-dwelling 65 + year-old adults .  We registered and conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis ( PROSPERO : CRD42017070892 ) of r and omized clinical trials ( RCT ) . We search ed three electronic data bases during January 2018 to identify RCT assessing any type of  exercise-based intervention .  Studies had to report a pre- , post- , and at least 6-month post-intervention follow-up . To be included , at least one PA outcome had to be assessed . The effect of  exercise-based interventions  was assessed compared to  active (  e.g. , a  low-intensity type of exercise , such as stretching or toning activities )  and  non-active (  e.g. ,  usual care ) control interventions  at several time points . Secondary analyses were conducted , restricted to studies that reported specific strategies to enhance  the sustainability of  PA  .  The intervention effect was measured on  self-reported and objective measures of time spent in  PA   , by means of st and ardized mean differences . St and ardized mean differences  of PA level  were pooled . Pooled estimates of effect were computed with the DerSimonian-Laird method , applying a r and om effects model . The risk of bias was also assessed . We included  12 studies , comparing 18  exercise intervention  groups to four  active  and nine  non-active control groups .   Nine studies reported specific strategies to  enhance the long-term sustainability  of PA .   The strategies were mostly related to the  self-efficacy , self-control , and behavior capability  principles based on the social cognitive theory .  Exercise interventions  compared to  active control  showed inconclusive and heterogeneous results . When compared to  non-active control , exercise  interventions  improved PA  time at the six-months follow up ( st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) 0.30 ; 95%CI 0.15 to 0.44 ;  four studies ; 724 participants  ; I2 0 % ) , but not at the one- or two-years follow-ups . No data were available on the mid- and long-term effect of adding strategies to enhance  the sustainability  of PA .  Exercise interventions  have small clinical benefits on   PA   levels in  community-dwelling older adults  , with a decline in the observed improvement after six months of the intervention cessation."
"DThis clinical practice guideline provides evidence -based recommendations for the treatment of  children diagnosed with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .   This guideline , the second in a set of policies on this condition , is intended for use by clinicians working in primary care setting s. The initiation of treatment requires the accurate establishment of a diagnosis of ADHD ; the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) clinical practice guideline on diagnosis of children with ADHD(1 ) provides direction in appropriately diagnosing this disorder . The AAP Committee on Quality Improvement selected a subcommittee composed of primary care and developmental-behavioral pediatricians and other experts in the fields of neurology , psychology , child psychiatry , education , family practice , and epidemiology . The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Evidence -based Practice Center at McMaster University , Ontario , Canada , to develop the evidence base of literature on this topic.(2 ) The result ing  systematic review  , along with other major studies in this area , was used to formulate recommendations for treatment of  children with ADHD .  The subcommittee also review ed the  multimodal treatment study of children with ADHD(3  ) and the  Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment report (CCOHTA).(4  ) Subcommittee decisions were made by consensus where definitive evidence was not available . The subcommittee report underwent extensive review by sections and committees of the AAP as well as by numerous external organizations before approval from the AAP Board of Directors . The guideline contains the following recommendations for the treatment of a child diagnosed with ADHD."
"yMost  people presenting with incident osteoporotic fractures  are neither assessed nor treated for osteoporosis to reduce their risk of further fractures , despite the availability of effective treatments . We evaluated the effectiveness of published models of care for the secondary prevention of  osteoporotic  fractures  .  We search ed  eight medical literature data bases to  identify  reports published between 1996 and 2011 , describing  models of care for secondary  fracture  prevention  .  Information extracted from each publication included study design , patient characteristics , identification strategies , assessment and treatment initiation strategies , as well as outcome measures  ( rates of bone mineral density ( BMD ) testing , osteoporosis treatment initiation , adherence , re-fractures and cost-effectiveness )  . Meta-analyses of studies with valid control groups were conducted for two outcome measures :  BMD testing and osteoporosis treatment initiation .   Out of 574 references , 42 articles were identified as analysable .  These studies were grouped into four general models  of care  — type A :  identification , assessment and treatment of patients as part of the service ;  type B :  similar  to  A  ,  without treatment initiation ;  type C :  alerting patients plus primary care physicians ;  and type D :  patient education only  . Meta-regressions revealed a trend towards increased  BMD testing  ( p = 0.06 ) and  treatment initiation  ( p = 0.03 ) with increasing intensity of intervention . One type A service with a valid control group showed a significant decrease in  re-fractures .  Types A and B services were  cost-effective  , although definition of  cost-effectiveness  varied between studies . Fully coordinated , intensive models of care for secondary fracture prevention are more  effective  in  improving patient outcomes  than approaches involving alerts and /or education only."
" Evidence of low quality suggests that  lactoferrin supplementation  to enteral feeds with or without probiotics decreases  late-onset sepsis and NEC stage II or III  in preterm infants without adverse effects .

Clarification regarding optimal dosing regimens , types of  lactoferrin  ( human or bovine ) , and long-term outcomes is needed."
"yThe importance of  vitamin D  for musculoskeletal health has long been recognized , and awareness of significant extra-skeletal effects in health and disease is rapidly emerging . Although it has been possible for many decades to quantify serum markers of vitamin D deficiency , and to correct deficiency at low cost and with high safety , the influence of vitamin D status on post-surgical outcomes has only recently been identified as a research topic of interest . To the present , these data have not been the subject matter of formal review . Accordingly , we conducted a systematic review to assess the association between  perioperative  vitamin D  status  and outcomes after surgery . The data bases of PubMed , Ovid MEDLINE , EMBASE , AMED , CINAHL ( EBSCOHost ) , The Cochrane Data bases of Systematic Review , and PROSPERO were search ed through December , 2014 for studies relating to  vitamin D  and surgery . The initial search yielded  90 manuscripts .  After applying exclusion criteria ,  31 studies were eligible for inclusion . Fifteen studies  employed prospect i ve observational design s ,  3  used prospect i ve r and omized protocol s , and  13  report retrospective data base interrogations . The main finding of the present review is that 26 of 31 studies ( 84 % ) report at least  one statistically significant worse outcome  in  patients with low vitamin D status  . Five of 31 studies ( 16 % ) found no association . In conclusion , this review supports the hypothesis that hypovitaminosis D is associated with adverse outcomes after diverse surgical procedures . Future studies should focus on additional surgeries and outcomes , and on the role of  vitamin D  supplementation in the improvement of  patient safety  in participants with low vitamin D status at the time of surgery."

"IStudy design : A systematic review . Objectives : The aim of this systematic review was to establish whether  combined aerobic training and muscle strength training  is effective in improving  aerobic fitness , muscle strength , function and /or quality of life ( QoL )  in  people with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .  Setting s : Faculty of Health Sciences .  University of Sydney , NSW , Australia .  Methods : A search was conducted for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , controlled trials , uncontrolled clinical trials , case series and cross-over studies involving  exercise interventions  that  included a combination of aerobic and strength components  , either in circuit-mode or in sequence for  people with SCI .  Method  ological quality  was independently rated using the PEDro scale and key findings were extracted from trials by two review ers . Results : The search identified  7981 abstract s  , from  which nine trials met  the inclusion criteria . From the nine selected trials , seven reported  aerobic outcomes  , two of which showed a statistically significant within-group difference in aerobic fitness . Five studies reported  muscle strength outcomes  , four of them showed a statistically significant within-group mean difference on at least one outcome measure . Two studies looked at  QoL  , one of them found a statistically significant between-group difference on one outcome measure . Conclusion : Our systematic review showed that literature on  SCI population  is scarce , of low quality and findings of existing studies are inconsistent . Thus , further RCTs with larger number of participants are needed to make a definite conclusion about the influence of  combined aerobic and muscle strength training  on  aerobic fitness , muscle strength and QoL  in people with SCI."
"dAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a common disorder of childhood that often persists into adulthood . Although  stimulant medications  are recommended as the first-line treatment for ADHD because of their documented short-term effects in children and adults , less is known about their effects on long-term outcome in adults . Here we review the  long-term efficacy and safety  of the  stimulant drugs methylpheni date and amphetamine  , as well as the related compound  atomoxetine .  We performed a systematic review to identify direct and indirect effects of  stimulant therapy  on long-term outcome in adults .  Five r and omized controlled trials (  RCTs ) , and 10 open-label extension studies of initial short-term RCTs , with total follow-up of at least 24weeks , were identified . All these RCTs found that medication was significantly  more efficacious  than placebo in treating  ADHD in adults  , and the extension studies showed that this favorable  effect  of medication was maintained during the open-label follow-up period . However , since the maximum duration of these pharmacological trials was 4years , we also review ed 18 defined naturalistic longitudinal and cross-sectional studies , to provide more information about  longer term functional outcomes , side effects and complications .  These observational studies also showed positive correlations between  early recognition of the disorder  , stimulant treatment during childhood and  favorable long-term outcome  in  adult ADHD patients .  In conclusion ,  stimulant therapy  of ADHD has  long-term beneficial effects  and is  well tolerated .  However , more longitudinal studies of long duration should be performed . In addition , the ethical issues involved in performing double blind RCTs of many years duration should be further explored."

"eIntroduction Periradicular  surgery  involves the placement of a  root-end filling  following root-end resection , to provide an apical seal to the root canal system . Historically several material s have been used in order to achieve this seal . Recently a class of material s known as  Bioceramics  have been adopted . The aim of this article is to provide a review of the outcomes of  periradicular surgery  when  Bioceramic root-end filling material s  are used on  human permanent teeth  in comparison to ""  traditional  "" material s. Methods & results An electronic literature search was performed in the data bases of Web of Science , PubMed and Google Scholar , between 2006 and 2017 , to collect clinical studies where  Bioceramic material s  were utilised as  retro grade filling material s  , and to compare such material s with  traditional material  s. In this search , 1 systematic review and  14  clinical studies were identified . Of these , 8 reported the  success rates  of  retro grade Bioceramics  , and 6 compared treatment outcomes of  mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA ) and traditional cements  when used as  root-end filling material  s. Conclusion  Bioceramic root-end filling material s  are shown to have  success rates  of 86.4 - 95.6 % ( over 1 - 5 years ) .  Bioceramics  has significantly higher  success rates  than amalgam , but they were statistically similar to  intermediate restorative  material ( IRM ) and Super ethoxybenzoic acid ( Super EBA ) when used as  retro grade filling material  s in apical surgery . However , it seems that the high  success rates  were not solely attributable to the type of the root-end filling material s. The surgical/microsurgical techniques and tooth prognostic factors may significantly affect treatment outcome."
 .  Airborne-particle abrasion and tribo-chemical silica coating  are the pre-treatment methods with more evidence in the literature . Increased adhesion could be expected after physico-chemical conditioning of zirconia . Surface contamination has a negative effect on adhesion . There is no evidence to support a universal adhesion protocol.
"sDirect   post- and -core restorations  with prefabricated posts  are becoming increasingly popular . A literature review was conducted to compare the  clinical  and in vitro performance of  cast posts and cores  to that of  direct cores with prefabricated posts  in single-rooted teeth . Research on the restoration of  endodontically treated teeth  was identified through a search of electronic data bases . The  search yielded a total of 1773 references .  After these references were subjected to strict inclusion criteria , 10 in vitro and 6 in vivo studies remained and critically review ed . A comparison of  fracture loads  in the in vitro studies revealed no significant difference between  cast and direct posts and cores .  Meta- analysis of the data suggested that there is no difference in  fracture behavior  associated with the 2 treatment modalities . An  overall survival  analysis was not possible for the in vivo studies . The  survival  for  cast posts and cores  in 2 studies ranged from 87.2 % to 88.1 % and in a third study reached 86.4 % for  direct cores  after 72 months . R and omized clinical trials on this topic were not available but should be conducted to verify published findings."
"yObjective : An adequate wheelchair propulsion capacity is required to perform daily life activities .  Exercise training  may be effective to gain or improve  wheelchair propulsion capacity .  This review investigates whether different types  of exercise training programs  are effective in improving  wheelchair propulsion capacity .  Data sources : PubMed and EMBASE data bases were search ed from their respective inceptions in October 2013 . Review methods :  Exercise training  studies with at least one outcome measure regarding wheelchair  propulsion  capacity were included . In this study wheelchair propulsion capacity includes four parameters to reflect functional wheelchair propulsion : cardio-respiratory fitness ( aerobic capacity ) , anaerobic capacity , muscular fitness and mechanical efficiency . Articles were not selected on diagnosis , training type or mode . Studies were divided into four training types :  interval , endurance , strength , and mixed training .  Method  ological quality  was rated with the PEDro scale , and the level of evidence was determined . Results :  The 21 included studies represented 249 individuals with spinal-cord injury ( 50 % ) , various diagnoses like spina bifida ( 4 % ) , cerebral palsy ( 2 % ) , traumatic injury , ( 3 % ) and able-bodied participants ( 38 % ) .  All interval training studies found a significant  improvement  of 18 -  64  % in  wheelchair propulsion capacity .  Three out of five endurance training studies reported  significant effectiveness . Method ological quality  was generally poor and there were only two r and omised controlled trials . Conclusion :  Exercise training programs  seem to be effective in improving  wheelchair propulsion capacity .  However , there is remarkably little research , particularly for individuals who do not have spinal-cord injury."
" Most evidence on  TCAs  relates to  desipramine .  Findings suggest that , in the short term ,  desipramine  improves the core  symptoms of ADHD  , but its effect on the cardiovascular system remains an important clinical concern . Thus , evidence supporting the clinical use of  desipramine  for the treatment of children with ADHD is low."
">INTRODUCTION  Pentoxifylline  is a xanthine derivative with potential cardiovascular benefits . AIM To evaluate the impact of  pentoxifylline  on   blood pressure ( BP )   and  plasma TNF-α , C-reactive protein ( CRP )  and IL-6 through a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials . METHODS The protocol was registered ( PROSPERO : CRD42016035988 ) . The search included PUBMED , ProQuest , Scopus and EMBASE until 1 September 2015 to identify trials reporting  BP or inflammatory markers during  pentoxifylline therapy .   Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a r and om-effects model , with weighted mean difference ( WDF ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) as summary statistics . RESULTS  Fifteen studies ( 16 treatment arms ) were found  to be  eligible for  inclusion . Meta- analysis did not suggest any effect  of pentoxifylline  on  either SBP or DBP   . Pentoxifylline  treatment was associated with a significant  reduction in plasma concentrations of TNF-α  ( WDF : -1.03 pg/ml , 95 % CI : -1.54 , -0.51 ; P < 0.001 , 11 treatment arms )  and CRP  ( WDF : -1.39 mg/l , 95 % CI : -2.68 , -0.10 ; P = 0.034 , five treatment arms ) . No  alteration in plasma IL-6 concentration  was observed . The impact  of pentoxifylline   on plasma TNF-α levels  was found to be positively associated with treatment duration ( slope : 0.031 ; 95 % CI : 0.004 , 0.057 ; P = 0.023 ) but  independent of pentoxifylline  dose ( slope : -0.0003 ; 95 % CI : -0.002 , 0.001 ;  P = 0.687 ) .  Pentoxifylline  did not  alter BP or plasma IL-6 concentration  , but  significantly reduced circulating TNF-α and CRP concentrations ."
"eObjectives Several iterations of the  Sport Concussion Assessment Tool ( SCAT )  have been published over the past 16 years . Our goal was to systematic ally review the literature related to the  SCAT  and provide recommendations for improving the tool . To achieve this goal , five separate but related search es were conducted and presented herein . Design Systematic literature review . Data sources Medline , Embase , PsycINFO , Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , SPORTD iscus and PubMed . Eligibility criteria Original , empirical , peer- review ed findings published in English and included sports-related concussion ( SRC ) . Review papers , case studies , editorials and conference proceedings/ abstract s were excluded .  The age range for the ChildSCAT was 5–12 years and for the Adult SCAT was 13 years and above .  Results Out of  2961 articles screened  , a total of  96 articles were  included across the five search es . Search es were not mutually exclusive . The final number of articles included in the qualitative synthesis for each search was 21 on Adult SCAT , 32 on ChildSCAT , 21 on sideline , 8 on video/observation and 14 on oculomotor . Summary / conclusions The  SCAT  is the most widely accepted and deployable sport concussion assessment and screening tool currently available . There is some degree of support for using the  SCAT2/SCAT3 and ChildSCAT3  in the evaluation of SRC , with and without baseline data . The addition of an oculomotor examination seems indicated , although the most valid method for assessing  oculomotor function  is not clear . Video-observable signs of concussion show promise , but there is insufficient evidence to warrant widespread use at this time."
"yPURPOSE Osteoporotic fracture is the main complication of osteoporosis . The current management is to discharge  patients  as early as possible so they can get back to their daily activities . Once discharged , there are three main issues relating to  morbidity , mortality , and risk of  a  subsequent fracture  that need to be addressed and discussed . Therefore , the aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate the evidence from published literature , to determine the outcome of  osteoporotic fracture patients after their hospital discharge .  METHODS The MEDLINE and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) data bases were search ed , using the terms "" osteoporosis "" , "" fracture "" , "" osteoporotic fracture "" , "" hip fracture  ""  , and "" vertebral fracture "" .  We included only human studies published in English between 2004 and 2014 .  The reference lists of included studies were thoroughly review ed in search for other relevant studies . RESULTS A total of  18  studies met the selection criteria . Most were observational and cohort studies . Out of all the studies , five studies looked into the  morbidity  , six studies looked into the  risk of subsequent fractures  , and seven studies looked into  mortality .  Vertebral fracture caused the greatest health burden , but hip fracture patients were the main users of informal care after hospital discharge . There was an increased  risk of a subsequent fracture  after a primary fracture compared with the control group , a cohort comparison , or the general population . Osteoporotic fractures , especially hip fractures , are associated with higher  mortality rate  despite the advances in the management of osteoporotic fracture cases .  There is strong evidence to show that after hospital discharge ,  osteoporotic fracture patients  are faced with higher morbidity , subsequent fractures , and mortality."
"hDetrusor overactivity ( DO ) is a common clinical problem having profound effects on the  quality of life ( QOL )  of  women .  With the use of  meshes  in the antiincontinence surgery , a new onset of DO , de novo DO has become an important issue in postoperative QOL of  women .  A systematic review of English language literature was conducted from Pubmed and publications of the last 7 years were analyzed and presented in this review . Multiple pathological events in the urothelium , sub-urothelium and possibly in the detrusor muscle seem to underlie the pathophysiology of DO . A variety of approaches , from  life style modification  to  minimal-invasive surgery  are available to treat DO and it is the responsibility of the physician to properly select and apply these modalities with the ultimate aim in improving the  QOL of  the patients . It is imperative to know the various pathophysiological processes that underlie the causation of DO to select proper management approach."
"sBACKGROUND  Pharmacists  may improve the clinical management of major risk factors for  cardiovascular disease ( CVD )  prevention . A systematic review was conducted to determine the impact of  pharmacist care  on the management of   CVD  risk  factors  among out patients .  METHODS The MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials data bases were search ed for r and omized controlled trials that involved   pharmacist care  interventions   among out patients with CVD risk factors .  Two review ers independently abstract ed data and classified  pharmacists '  interventions .  Mean changes in blood pressure , total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and proportion of smokers  were estimated using r and om effects models . RESULTS  Thirty r and omized controlled trials ( 11,765 patients ) were identified .   Pharmacist interventions exclusively conducted by a pharmacist  or  implemented in collaboration with physicians or nurses included patient educational interventions , patient-reminder systems , measurement of CVD risk factors , medication management and feedback to physician , or educational intervention  to health care professionals .  Pharmacist  care was associated with significant reductions in  systolic/diastolic blood pressure  ( 19 studies [ 10,479 patients ] ; -8.1 mm Hg [ 95 % confidence interval { CI } , -10.2 to -5.9]/-3.8 mm Hg [ 95 % CI,-5.3 to -2.3 ] ) ;  total cholesterol  ( 9 studies [ 1121 patients ] ; -17.4 mg/L [ 95 % CI,-25.5 to -9.2 ] ) ,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( 7 studies [ 924 patients ] ; -13.4 mg/L [ 95 % CI,-23.0 to -3.8 ] ) , and a  reduction in the risk of smoking  ( 2 studies [ 196 patients ] ; relative risk , 0.77 [ 95 % CI , 0.67 to 0.89 ] ) . While most studies tended to favor  pharmacist care  compared with usual  care  , a substantial heterogeneity was observed .   Pharmacist-directed care or in collaboration with physicians  or nurses improve the management of major CVD risk factors in out patients."

"aCow ’s milk protein allergy ( CMPA ) is the commonest food allergy in infancy and is associated with significant health burden . Given their immune modulatory properties ,  probiotics  have been proposed as a strategy for management of CMPA . We aim ed to systematic ally review efficacy and safety of  probiotics  in the management of CMPA . Data bases PubMed , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Central Library , and Google scholar were search ed in August 2018 for r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) of  probiotic supplementation  as an adjunct in the management of  infants with suspected/proven CMPA .  Primary outcomes were  resolution of hematochezia and acquisition of tolerance to CMP  at 6 , 12 , 24 , and 36 months . Secondary outcomes included  effect on allergic symptoms ( SCORAD index ) , growth , gut microbiota , and adverse effects .  A total of  10 RCTs ( n = 845 ;  probiotics  , 422 ; control , 423 ) with low to unclear risk of bias  were  included  . Meta- analysis showed probiotic supplementation was not associated with  earlier resolution of hematochezia  ( n = 87 ; RR : 1.45 ( 95 % CI : 0.96–2.18 ) , p = 0.08 ; level of evidence ( LOE ) , very low ) , in presumed CMPA . In confirmed CMPA , probiotics were associated with higher  rate of acquisition of tolerance to CMP  at the end of 3 years compared with  placebo  ( N = 493 ; RR , 1.47 ; 95 % CI , ( 1.17–1.84 ) ; p = 0.0009 ; LOE , low ] . Meta- analysis was not possible for other outcomes . There were no probiotic related  adverse effects  . Conclusion : Limited low- quality evidence indicates that  probiotic supplementation  may be associated with  earlier acquisition of tolerance to CMP  in  children with CMPA .  Large well- design ed trials are essential to confirm these findings .What is Known:• Cow ’s milk protein allergy ( CMPA ) is one of the commonest food allergies in  children .  CMPA is associated with significant socioeconomic burden.• Elimination diet and extensively hydrolyzed formula is the mainstay of the management of CMPA.What is New:• This first systematic review of r and omized controlled trials shows that  probiotics  as an adjuvant can lead to  earlier acquisition of tolerance to CMP   in children at 36 months of age .  However , the evidence is low quality and influenced by data from one large study .•  Probiotic supplementation  was not associated with  earlier resolution of  hematochezia."
" We found very low- quality evidence indicating that  pain , recovery , disability and sick leave  are similar after exercises when compared with  no treatment  , with  minor intervention controls  or with  exercises  provided as additional treatment to  people with work-related complaints of the arm ,  neck or shoulder . Low- quality evidence also showed that ergonomic interventions did not decrease  pain  at short-term follow-up but did decrease  pain  at long-term follow-up . There was no evidence of an effect on other outcomes . For behavioural and other interventions , there was no evidence of a consistent effect on any of the outcomes . Studies are needed that include more participants , that are clear about the diagnosis of work-relatedness and that report findings according to current guidelines."
"  19 potentially eligible articles were identified .  Overall , a weak independent association was found with an estimated summary RR of 0.89 for a change of one st and ard deviation in  total testosterone level  ( 95 % CI 0.83 to 0.96 ) . Age of study population and year of publication modified the relationship between testosterone and CVD . The estimated  summary RR  was 1.01 ( 0.95 to 1.08 ) for  studies of men younger than 70 years of age  , and 0.84 ( 0.76 to 0.92 ) for  studies including men over 70 years of age .  The latter studies showed a particular pronounced association if published after 1 January 2007 . Results were largely confirmed by separate analyses of  free- and bioavailable testosterone .  The systematic review displayed no association between  endogenous testosterone  and  risk for  CVD  in middle-aged men . In elderly men  , testosterone may weakly protect against  CVD .  Alternatively , low testosterone may indicate a poor general health."

" Currently , there is inadequate evidence to conclude whether  milnacipran  is superior , inferior or the same as other antidepressive agents in terms of  efficacy , acceptability and tolerability  in the acute  phase treatment  of  major depression  . However , there is some evidence in favour of  milnacipran  over  TCAs  in terms of  dropouts due to adverse events ( acceptability )  and  the rates of experiencing adverse events ( tolerability ) .  Information about other clinical ly meaningful outcomes such as  cost-effectiveness and social functioning  , including the ability to return to work , is lacking . Further study is needed to answer whether  milnacipran  would be the better choice of antidepressant for acute major depression."
"yThe number of available  walking tests  has increased dramatically over the past decades . Therefore , it is highly important to help clinicians choose the most appropriate  walking test  for a specific setting . This systematic review aim ed to critically evaluate the reliability ,  validity  , and responsiveness of  clinical walking speed  in a broad  population of elderly persons living in the community , sheltered housing , or institutions .  Literature search es were performed in several different data bases . Key words were based on the topic of the measurement properties of performance-based clinical tools for quantifying walking . The instrument selected for review was   walking speed .   The methods and results of all the evaluated measurement properties were rated by using a st and ard checklist for appraising the qualitative attributes and measurement properties of the instrument . A  total number of 3,781 abstract s were review ed , and 86 articles were chosen for inclusion  .   Habitual walking speed   seems to be highly reliable in  community-dwelling people and residents in mixed setting  s. There have not been any studies that accord with our inclusion and exclusion criteria that have evaluated the  reliability  of  maximum walking speed  in an  aged population .   Walking speed  is a highly valid test , both at habitual and maximum speed . Few studies gave information about  responsiveness  for  walking speed  , which means that these results can not be evaluated properly .  Habitual walking speed  is a reliable measure , but  maximum walking speed  needs further evaluation . Both habitual and maximum walking speeds are valid instruments , and they predict death , hospitalization/institutionalization , and decline in mobility."

There is no convincing evidence that  iron  treatment has an effect on  mental development  in children below 27 months of age or on motor development.
">To estimate the associations between  vitamin D status  and  multiple sclerosis ( MS )  . We search ed electronic data bases of the human literature in PubMed , EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to February , 2014 using the following keywords :  ' vitamin D ' or ' 25(OH)D '  and ' status ' or ' deficiency ' or ' insufficiency ' and ' multiple sclerosis ' . A systematic review and meta- analysis were conducted on observational studies that reported the association between  blood  vitamin D  levels  and MS .  Eleven studies  met the inclusion criteria  . 1007 patients and 829 controls were included .  Results of our meta- analysis show that  MS patients  had  lower mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25(OH)D ]  than healthy controls ( weighted mean difference[MD ] , -14.52 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -23.83 to -5.22 ) . There were statistically significant heterogeneity ( P<0.00001 ; I(2)=92 % ) . The significant heterogeneity may be due to the differences in ethnicity , country , season of blood sampling and age of the participants studied . To sum up ,  low  vitamin D   levels are associated with an increased risk of  MS ."

"nAbstract Lisman , PJ , de la Motte , SJ , Gribbin , TC , Jaffin , DP , Murphy , K , and Deuster , PA . A systematic review of the association between physical fitness and musculoskeletal injury risk : part 1—cardiorespiratory endurance . J Strength Cond Res 31(6 ) : 1744–1757 , 2017—Musculoskeletal injuries ( MSK-Is ) are a significant health problem for both  military  and  athletic  population s. Research indicates that MSK-I is associated with physical fitness ; however , the association between specific components of physical fitness and MSK-I in military and athletic population s has not been systematic ally examined . Our goal was to systematic ally review the literature to provide a best evidence synthesis on the relationship between components of physical fitness and MSK-I risk in  military and civilian athletic population  s. This first of 3 manuscripts focuses on cardiorespiratory endurance ( CRE ) . MEDLINE , EBSCO , EMBASE , and the Defense Technical Information Center were search ed for original studies published from 1970 through 2015 that examined associations between physical fitness and MSK-I.  Forty-nine of 4,229 citations met  our  inclusion criteria .  Primary findings indicate that there is ( a ) strong evidence that  poor performance on a set distance run for time  is a predictor for MSK-I risk in both genders ; ( b ) strong evidence that  poor performance on timed shuttle runs  is a predictor for MSK-I risk in males ; ( c ) moderate evidence in males and limited evidence in females that  poor performance on a timed step test  is a predictor of MSK-I risk ; and ( d ) limited or insufficient evidence that  poor performance on the Cooper run test , maximal and submaximal aerobic grade d exercise tests , and the Conconi test  are predictors of MSK-I risk in males or females or both . Several measures of CRE are risk factors for training-related MSK-I in military and civilian athletic population s , indicating that CRE may be an important measure for MSK-I risk stratification."

"s& NA ; Current evidence suggests that  statin  use decreases the incidence of  cardiovascular diseases  ( CVD ) through reducing LDL cholesterol and decreasing inflammation . Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) is usually associated with increased  inflammatory markers  and  increased risk of CVD  . We conducted a systematic review and meta‐ analysis to determine the effect of  statin  use on  inflammatory markers including C‐reactive protein ( CRP ) , tumor necrosis factor‐&agr ; ( TNF‐&agr ; ) , interleukin‐6 ( IL‐6 ) and interleukin‐1 ( IL‐1 )  among  patients with MetS and related disorders .  PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science data bases , and Cochrane Library were search ed for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) through April 2018 . Three independent investigators evaluated study eligibilities , extracted data , and assessed study quality using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool and Jadad 's  quality scales  . Heterogeneity was determined using Cochran 's Q statistic and I‐square ( I2 ) test . Based on the heterogeneity results , we pooled data using r and om‐effect or fixed effect models presented as st and ardized mean differences ( SMD ) and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) .  One hundred thirteen RCTs ( 19,644 patients ) were included in  our meta‐  analysis  . The pooled results using r and om effects model showed  that statin  use statistically  significantly decreased CRP level  ( SMD= ‐0.97 ; 95 % CI , ‐1.10 , ‐0.85 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 : 95.1 %  )  ,  TNF‐&agr  ; ( SMD= ‐1.88 ; 95 % CI , ‐2.40 , ‐1.38 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 :  97.2 % ) , IL‐6  ( SMD= ‐1.67 ; 95 % CI , ‐1.98 , ‐1.34 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 :  96.5 % ) , and IL‐1  concentrations ( SMD= ‐8.35 ; 95 % CI , ‐10.49 , ‐6.22 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 : 98.4 % ) among  patients with MetS and related  disorders . Our meta‐ analysis showed beneficial  effects   of statin use   on reducing inflammatory markers  in patients with MetS and related disorders."
"EBACKGROUND It is currently unclear whether altering the carbohydrate-to-protein ratio of low-fat , energy-restricted diets augments  weight loss and cardiometabolic risk  markers . OBJECTIVE The objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies that compared  energy-restricted , isocaloric , high-protein , low-fat ( HP ) diets with st and ard-protein , low-fat ( SP ) diets  on  weight loss , body composition , resting energy expenditure ( REE ) , satiety and appetite , and cardiometabolic risk factors  . DESIGN Systematic search es were conducted by using MEDLINE , EMBASE , PubMed , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify weight-loss trials that compared  isocalorically prescribed diets  matched for fat intake but that differed in protein and carbohydrate intakes in  participants aged ≥18 y. Twenty-four trials that included 1063 individuals satisfied the inclusion criteria .   RESULTS Mean ( ±SD ) diet  duration was 12.1 ± 9.3 wk . Compared with an SP  diet  ,  an  HP diet produced more favorable  changes in weighted mean differences for reductions in body weight  ( -0.79 kg ; 95 % CI : -1.50 ,  -0.08 kg ) , fat mass  ( FM ; -0.87 kg ; 95 % CI : -1.26 , -0.48 kg  ) , and triglycerides  ( -0.23 mmol/L ; 95 % CI : -0.33 , -0.12  mmol/L  ) and mitigation  of reductions in fat-free mass  ( FFM ; 0.43 kg ; 95 % CI : 0.09 , 0.78  kg ) and  REE ( 595.5 kJ/d ; 95 % CI : 67.0 ,  1124.1 kJ/d ) . Changes in fasting plasma glucose , fasting insulin , blood pressure , and total , LDL , and HDL cholesterol  were similar across dietary treatments ( P ≥  0.20 ) . Greater  satiety  with  HP was reported in 3 of 5 studies .  Compared with an energy-restricted  SP  diet , an isocalorically prescribed HP diet provides modest  benefits for reductions in body weight , FM , and triglycerides  and for  mitigating reductions in FFM and  REE."
"sQUESTION What is the effect of  exercise  on reducing  impairment  and increasing  activity  in the rehabilitation of  people with upper limb fractures  ? DESIGN Systematic review of controlled trials . PARTICIPANTS  Adults following an upper limb fracture .  INTERVENTION  Any exercise therapy program  , including trials where  exercise  was delivered to both groups providing there was an expectation of different amounts of  exercise .  OUTCOME MEASURES  Body structure and function , and activity limitations .  RESULTS  13 relevant trials involving 781 participants with an upper limb fracture were identified .  12 of the 13 trials included  exercise  of different duration and administration in both intervention and comparison groups . In support of the role of  exercise  there is evidence that :  exercise  and  advice  compared to no intervention reduce  pain  and  improve upper limb activity  in the short term after distal radius fracture ; starting exercise earlier after conservatively managed proximal humeral fractures can reduce  pain  and  improve shoulder activity  ; and physiotherapy that included  supervised exercise and home exercise  increased  wrist movement  after distal radius fracture when compared to  home exercise alone .  There is contrary evidence from two trials one after distal radius fracture and one after proximal humeral fracture that a  home exercise program  was superior to a  supervised plus home exercise program .  Only a single meta- analysis was conducted due to clinical heterogeneity and a lack of common outcome measures among the included trials .  There is evidence to support the role of  specific exercise regimens  in reducing  impairments  and  improving upper limb function  following specific upper limb fractures."

"aOBJECTIVE To identify and critically appraise the evidence for the effectiveness of  custom orthoses for the  foot and ankle  in rheumatoid arthritis .  METHODS Studies were identified in  appropriate electronic data bases ( from 1950 to March 2011 ) .  The search term ""  rheumatoid arthritis  "" with "" foot "" and "" ankle "" and related terms were used in conjunction with  "" orthoses ""  and  synonyms .   Included studies were quantitative longitudinal studies and included r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , case-control trials , cohort studies , and case series studies .  All outcome measures were investigated . Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration criteria with additional criteria for sample population representativeness , quality of statistical analysis , and compliant intervention use and presence of co interventions . Meta-analyses were conducted for outcome domains with multiple RCTs . Qualitative data synthesis was conducted for the remaining outcome domains . Levels of evidence were then assigned to each outcome measure . RESULTS The inclusion criteria were met  by 17 studies .  Two studies had high quality for internal validity and 3 studies had high quality for external validity . No study had high quality for both internal and external validity . Six outcome domains were identified . There was weak evidence for   custom orthoses  reducing pain and forefoot plantar pressures .  Evidence was inconclusive for  foot function , walking speed , gait parameters , and reducing hallux abductovalgus angle progression .    Custom orthoses  may be beneficial in  reducing pain and elevated forefoot plantar pressures  in  the rheumatoid foot and ankle .  However , more definitive research is needed in this area."

"sFructose-containing  sugars  are a focus of attention as a public health target for their putative role in  obesity and cardiometabolic disease including diabetes .  The fructose moiety is singled out to be the primary driver for the harms of  sugars  due to its unique endocrine signal and pathophysiological role . However , this is only supported by ecological studies , animal models of overfeeding and select human intervention studies with supraphysiological doses or lack of control for energy . The highest level of evidence from systematic review s and meta-analyses of controlled trials has not shown that  fructose-containing sugars  behave any differently from other forms of digestible carbohydrates .  Fructose-containing sugars  can only lead to  weight gain and other unintended harms on cardiometabolic risk factors  insofar as the excess calories they provide . Prospect i ve cohort studies , which provide the strongest observational evidence , have shown an association between  fructose-containing sugars  and  cardiometabolic risk including weight gain , cardiovascular disease outcomes and diabetes  only when restricted to  sugar-sweetened beverages  and not for  sugars  from other sources . In fact ,  sugar-sweetened  beverages are a marker of an unhealthy lifestyle and their drinkers consume more calories , exercise less , smoke more and have a poor dietary pattern . The potential for overconsumption of sugars in the form of sugary foods and drinks makes targeting  sugars  , as a source of excess calories , a prudent strategy . However , sugar content should not be the sole determinant of a healthy diet . There are many other factors in the diet — some providing excess calories while others provide beneficial nutrients . Rather than just focusing on one energy source , we should consider the whole diet for health benefits."
"yAbstract Objective : To systematic ally review and summarize the clinimetric properties , including  reliability  ,  validity  , and responsiveness , the procedures used , and the meanings of the scores in the  Timed Up and Go Test ( TUG ) .  The  TUG  is a performance test that identifies problems with functional mobility in  patients with stroke .  Methods : MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were search ed from 1991 to January  2013 . Studies were  included  if ( 1 ) the participants were adults with stroke ; ( 2 )  the research design was cross-sectional , descriptive , or longitudinal and examined the clinimetric properties , including reliability , validity , and sensitivity to change , and procedural differences in the  TUG   ; and ( 3 ) the study was published in English from 1991 to January 2013 .  Results :  Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria  . Of these , 4 showed the  TUG  to have good  convergent validity  , as it had significant correlations with various instruments . Three studies that investigated the  test-retest reliability  showed the  TUG  to have excellent  intrarater and interrater reliability  ( intraclass correlation coefficient [ ICC ] > 0.95 ) . The 3 studies that investigated whether the   TUG   could  predict falls after stroke  showed inconclusive results . Three studies showed the   TUG   to be sensitive to change , and 1 study showed the  TUG  to be  responsive  in  moderate-  and  fast-walking patients with stroke  . However , there were wide variations in the procedures and instructions used . Conclusion : The  TUG  can be recommended for measuring  basic mobility skills  after stroke in  patients who are able to walk .  However , the procedures and instructions should be described more clearly."
"sSummary Aims The aim of this non‐ systematic review was to provide a practical guide for clinicians on the evidence for central sensitisation in  chronic osteoarthritis ( OA ) pain  and how this pain mechanism can be addressed in terms of clinical diagnosis , investigation and treatment . Methods The authors undertook a non‐ systematic review of the literature including a MEDLINE search ( search terms included central sensitisation , osteoarthritis , osteoarthrosis ) for relevant and current clinical studies , systematic review s and narrative review s. Case reports , letters to the editor and similar literature sources were excluded . Information was organised to allow a pragmatic approach to the discussion of the evidence and generation of practical recommendations . Results There is good evidence for a role of central sensitisation in chronic OA pain in a subgroup of patients  .  Clinical ly , a central sensitisation component in chronic OA pain can be suspected based on characteristic pain features and non‐pain features seen in other conditions involving central sensitisation . However , there are currently no diagnostic inventories for central sensitisation specific to OA . Biomarkers may be helpful for confirming the presence of central sensitisation , especially when there is diagnostic uncertainty . Several  non‐pharmacological and pharmacological treatments  may be  effective  in OA patients with central sensitisation features .  Multimodal therapy  may be required to achieve control of symptoms . Discussion Clinicians should be aware of central sensitisation in  patients with chronic OA pain  , especially in patients presenting with severe pain with unusual features."
"eSummary  Neurofeedback ( NF )  is a training to enhance self-regulatory capacity over brain activity patterns and consequently over brain mental states . Recent findings suggest that  NF  is a promising alternative for the treatment of   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (  ADHD  ) .  We comprehensively review ed literature search ing for studies on the effectiveness and specificity of  NF  for the treatment of  ADHD .  In addition , clinical ly informative evidence -based data are discussed . We found 3 systematic review on the use of   NF  for ADHD  and  6 r and omized controlled trials that  have not been included in these review s. Most nonr and omized controlled trials found positive results with medium-to-large effect sizes , but the evidence for effectiveness are less robust when only r and omized controlled studies are considered . The direct comparison of  NF and sham-NF  in 3 published studies have found no group differences , nevertheless method ological caveats , such as the quality of the training protocol used , sample size , and sample selection may have contributed to the negative results . Further data on  specificity  comes from electrophysiological studies reporting that   NF  effectively changes brain activity patterns .  No  safety issues  have emerged from clinical trials and  NF  seems to be  well tolerated and accepted .  Follow-up studies support  long-term effects  of  NF  .   Currently there is no available data to guide clinicians on the  predictors of response to  NF   and on optimal treatment protocol . In conclusion ,  NF  is a valid option for the treatment for  ADHD  , but further evidence is required to guide its use."
" Based on the limited number of published RCTs , the  systolic/diastolic blood pressure-lowering effect  of loop diuretics is -8/-4 mmHg , which is likely an overestimate . We grade d the quality of evidence for both  systolic  and  diastolic blood pressure  estimates as "" low "" due to the high risk of bias of included studies and the high likelihood of publication bias . We found no clinical ly meaningful  blood pressure-lowering  differences between different drugs within the loop diuretic class . The  dose-ranging effects  of loop diuretics could not be evaluated . The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with  loop diuretics  because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of  adverse effects  in many of the trials."
" Prevalences widely differ between studies reporting on  aspirin resistance  .

" While the results of this systematic review are promising , there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of  text message-based interventions  for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD .

" : Currently , there is insufficient evidence about the effects of  combined aerobic and resistance exercise  compared to  isolated aerobic exercise  or  usual care  on  walking performance .  However , despite the low quality of evidence , the  combined aerobic and resistance exercise  seems to be an effective strategy to improve  walking performance  in  patients with intermittent claudication .  These  combined exercise modes or isolated aerobic exercise  produce positive and significant results on  walking performance .  The usual care approach has a trend to deteriorate the  walking performance .  Thus , given the scarcity of data , new r and omized controlled trial studies that include assessment s of cardiovascular risk factors are urgently required to better determine the effect of this exercise combination."

"dWater-based  exercises  are recommended for  people with osteoarthritis ( OA )  , due to the beneficial effects on  physical function , quality of life and symptom reduction .  However , the effects on  muscle strength  are still controversial . The aim of this review was to assess and compare the effects of  aquatic exercise programs  on  muscle strength and physical function  in  people with OA .  A systematic search was performed at Pubmed , Scopus and Web of Science data bases . Clinical trials with interventions involving  aquatic exercises  for  individuals with OA  were included . The method ological quality of the studies was evaluated using the PEDro scale .  296 studies were found and twelve were selected : six studies comparing  water-based exercises with l and -based exercise  , and six comparing  water-based exercise groups with the control group .   Exercise programs included  muscle strengthening , aerobic , balance , flexibility and stretching exercises .  Duration of the program , weekly frequency , intensity and progression varied between studies .  Beneficial effects  of  aquatic exercise  were found on physical function . However , only two of five studies that assessed  muscle strength  observed  positive effect  of   aquatic  exercise .  Although it is difficult to compare studies and establish guidelines for the st and ardized protocol formulation , it was observed that  water-based exercises  can be effective on improving  physical function  and  increasing muscle strength  , since they are well-structured , with exercise intensity and overload controlled."
" Evidence of fair method ological quality suggests  that walking  is associated with significant improvements in outcome compared with control interventions but longer-term effectiveness is uncertain . With the use of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force system , walking can be recommended as an effective form of exercise or activity for  individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain  but should be supplemented with strategies aim ed at maintaining participation . Further work is required for examining effects on important health-related outcomes in this population in robustly design ed studies."

"sBackground : In the era of advanced surgical techniques and improved perioperative care , the willingness to perform emergency operations in  elderly patients  continues to increase . This systematic review aim ed at assessing the  clinical outcomes  of  early cholecystectomy  in  elderly patients with acute cholecystitis .  Methods : Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Library data bases were systematic ally search ed for studies reporting on  early cholecystectomy   for acute cholecystitis in patients aged ≥70 years .   The conversion rate , perioperative morbidity , and mortality  were calculated using a r and om-effects model . Results : Eight articles fell within the scope of this study . In total ,  592 patients were identified . The mean age was 81 years .   Early cholecystectomy  was performed laparoscopically in 316 patients ( 53 % ) and open in 276 patients ( 47 % ) . The procedure was associated  with a conversion rate  of 23 % ( 95 % CI 18.6 - 28.3 ) ,  a perioperative morbidity  of 24 % ( 95 % CI 20.5 - 27.5 ) ,  and a mortality  of 3.5 % ( 95 % CI 2.3 - 5.4 ) . Conclusion :  Early cholecystectomy  seems to be a feasible treatment in  elderly patients with acute cholecystitis .  To reduce morbidity , patients who may benefit from surgery ought to be selected carefully . Future prospect i ve studies should compare  early cholecystectomy  with alternative treatments to select the treatment that is most appropriate for elderly patients."

"gOBJECTIVES Our aim is to present a summary of the 2010 version of the European Association of Urology ( EAU ) guidelines on the treatment of  advanced , relapsing , and castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) .  METHODS The working panel performed a literature review of the new data emerging from 2007 to 2010 . The guidelines were up date d , and the levels of evidence ( LEs ) and /or grade s of recommendation ( GR ) were added to the text based on a systematic review of the literature , which included a search of online data bases and bibliographic review s. RESULTS Luteinising hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonists are the st and ard of care in metastatic prostate cancer ( PCa ) . Although LHRH antagonists decrease  testosterone  without any testosterone surge , their clinical benefit remains to be determined . Complete and rogen blockade has a small  survival benefit  of about 5 % .  Intermittent and rogen deprivation ( IAD )  results in equivalent  oncologic efficacy  when compared with  continuous and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT )  in well-selected population s. In  locally advanced and metastatic PCa  , early  ADT  does not result in a significant  survival advantage  when compared with delayed  ADT .   Relapse  after local therapy is defined by  prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) values  > 0.2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy ( RP ) and > 2 ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy ( RT ) . Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes  salvage RT  at PSA levels < 0.5 ng/ml and  salvage RP  or  cryosurgical ablation  of the prostate in radiation failures .  Endorectal magnetic resonance  imaging and  11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed  tomography ( CT ) are of limited importance if the PSA is < 2.5 ng/ml ; bone scans and CT can be omitted unless PSA is > 20 ng/ml . Follow-up after ADT should include  screening for the metabolic syndrome  and an  analysis of PSA and testosterone levels .  Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) includes  second-line hormonal therapy , novel agents , and chemotherapy with docetaxel  at 75 mg/m(2 ) every 3 wk .  Cabazitaxel  as a second-line therapy for relapse after  docetaxel  might become a future option .  Zoledronic acid  and  denusomab  can be used in  men with CRPC and osseous metastases  to prevent  skeletal-related complications .   The knowledge in the field of advanced , metastatic ,  and  CRPC is rapidly changing . These EAU guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice .

"sWe read with great interest the article by Zuccotti et al. about the possibility of implementing a primary prevention strategy for  allergic diseases  ( 1 ) . This article is conceptually linked to the EAACI Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Guidelines recommendations ( 2 ) that stated ‘ there is no evidence to recommend that  breastfeeding women  should modify their diet or take any supplements such as  probiotics  in order to prevent food allergy in their children ’ and during infancy that ‘ there is no evidence to recommend  prebiotics or probiotics  or  other dietary supplements  based on particular nutrients to prevent food allergy ’ . It is also linked to the recently published WAO guidelines ( 3 ) which are partially conflicting with the previous conclusion because it suggests that ‘ using  probiotics  in  women who breastfeed  infants at high risk of developing allergy , because considering all critical outcomes , there is a net benefit result ing primarily from prevention of eczema ( conditional recommendation , very low quality evidence ) ’ . We have already commented the above-mentioned discrepancies by supporting the lack of evidence to indicate the use of  probiotics  in the primary prevention of  atopic eczema  ( 4 , 5 ) . This systematic review and meta- analysis ( 1 ) substantially examine the same patients . The authors describe a significant effect of   probiotic supplementation   in the reduction of  the relative risk for eczema  in infants and conclude that ‘ the prevention of infantile  eczema  represents a potential indication for  probiotic  use during pregnancy and early infancy ’ ( 1 ) . In our opinion , two method ological points determining the bias of the results are question able . The first point is the inclusion of the same patients at different phases of follow-up in the statistical analysis . In particular , the study conducted by Rautawa et al. ( 6 ) was a part of a double-blind ,  placebo-controlled  trial performed by Kalliomaki et al. ( 7 ) ; the study by Prescott et al. ( 8) represents a follow-up of the same infants recruited and described by Taylor et al. ( 9 ) . Furthermore , Abrahamsson et al. ( 10 ) showed results after a 7-year follow-up of  infants  from a  previous r  and omized double-blind placebo-controlled trial published in 2007 ( 11 ) ; part of immunological and clinical data of the same infants are also reported in the article by Bottcher et al. ( 12 ) . Wickens et al. showed in three different articles the outcomes at 2 , 4 and 6 years of the same children ( 13–15 ) . In case of more than one publication or more than one follow-up of the same population , we believe that only data from one study for a specific item (  eczema  ) should be considered and included in a correct statistical analysis . The second point to highlight is the heterogeneity of the probiotics used , as also the WAO guidelines ( 3 ) observed . For example , the analysis of a  subgroup of patients named ‘ sub-meta- analysis ’  showed significant  effect of  probiotic ‘ mixtures ’ supplementation   in the  prevention of eczema  ( RR 0.54 [ 95 % CI : 0.43–0.68 ] , P < 0.00001 ) ( 1 ) .  Probiotic mixtures  used in these studies were all different ( Table 1 ) . As."
 Using such quality appraisal tools is m and atory to assess whether specific observational real-life effectiveness studies can be used to inform guideline development and /or decision-making in clinical practice.

" Efficient re source allocation should entail increased investments at the organisational context level where most barriers are expected to occur . It is likely that investments at the social context level will also help to decrease the  development of barriers  at the organisational context level , especially by increasing staff involvement and satisfaction . If future research is to adequately inform practice and policy regarding the impact of these efforts on health outcomes , focus on the actual relationships between context , mechanisms and outcomes should be actively incorporated into study design."
"eBackground  Electronic health ( e-Health ) interventions  are emerging as an effective alternative model for improving secondary prevention of  coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .  The aim of this study was to describe the effectiveness of different modes of delivery and components in  e-Health secondary prevention programmes  on adherence to treatment , modifiable CAD risk factors and psychosocial outcomes for  patients with CAD .  Method A systematic review was carried out based on articles found in MEDLINE , CINAHL , and Embase . Studies evaluating  secondary prevention e-Health programmes  provided through  mobile-Health ( m-Health ) , web-based technology or a combination of m-Health and web-based technology  were eligible . The main outcomes measured were  adherence to treatment , modifiable CAD risk factors and psychosocial outcomes .  The quality appraisal of the studies included was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for RCT . The results were synthesis ed narratively . Result  A total of 4834 titles were identified and 1350 were screened for eligibility .  After review ing  123 articles in  full  , 24 RCTs including 3654 participants with CAD were included .  Eight studies delivered  secondary prevention programmes through m-Health  , nine through  web-based technology  , and seven studies used a  combination of m-Health and web-based technology .  The majority of studies employed two or three secondary prevention components , of which health education was employed in 21 studies . The  m-Health  programmes reported positive effects on  adherence to medication .  Most studies evaluating  web-based technology programmes  alone or in combination with  m-Health  also utilised  traditional CR  , and reported improved  modifiable CAD risk factors .  The quality appraisal showed a moderate method ological quality of the studies . Conclusion Evidence exists that supports the use of  e-Health interventions  for improving secondary prevention of CAD . However , a comparison across studies highlighted a wide variability of components and outcomes within the different modes of delivery . High quality trials are needed to define the most efficient mode of delivery and components capable of addressing a favourable outcome for patients .Trial registration Not applicable."

"dElectroacupuncture  ( EA )  is considered to be a promising alternative therapy to relieve the menstrual pain for primary  dysmenorrhea  (  PD  ) , but the conclusion is controversial . Here , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis specifically to evaluate the clinical efficacy from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on the use of  EA  in  patients with PD .  PubMed , Embase , ISI Web of Science , CENTRAL , CNKI , and Wanfang were search ed to identify RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of  EA  for PD . The outcome measurements included  visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , verbal rating scale ( VRS ) , COX retrospective symptom scale ( RSS ) , and the curative rate .   Nine RCTs with high risk of  bias were included for meta- analysis . The combined  VAS  30 minutes after the completion of intervention favoured  EA  at SP6 when compared with  EA  at GB39 , nonacupoints , and waiting-list groups .  EA  was superior to pharmacological treatment when the treatment duration lasted for three menstrual cycles , evidence d by significantly higher curative rate . No statistically significant differences between  EA  at SP6 and control groups were found regarding the  VRS , RSS-COX1 , and RSS-COX2 .  The findings of our study suggested that  EA  can provide considerable immediate analgesia effect for PD . Additional studies with rigorous design and larger sample sizes are needed."
 Further research is needed before routine use of  prebiotics  can be recommended for prevention of  allergy  in  formula fed infants .  There is some evidence that a  prebiotic supplement  added to infant feeds may prevent  eczema .  It is unclear whether the use of  prebiotic  should be restricted to infants at high risk of allergy or may have an effect in low risk population s ; or whether it may have an effect on other allergic diseases including asthma.
"eInterventions using the  ""  Four   Immeasurables  Meditations  ""  ( FIM )  are effective for various outcomes ; however , whether increased meditation practice in these interventions leads to better results has not been well investigated . This systematic review included  22  FIM interventions  that reported  associations between the  amount of   meditation  practice   and  its outcomes .  Despite the heterogeneity in intervention components and outcome variables , there were generally few significant associations between amount of  meditation  practice and its  outcomes .  Specifically , only five studies reported that more than half of the calculated results were significant . In comparison with correlations between total  amount of practice  and overall  outcomes  , the short-term influence of meditation practice was evaluated in fewer studies ; however , it had a better association with outcomes . More studies are required that address the underlying mechanisms that eluci date how meditation practice leads to outcome changes in daily life . In this study , two promising mechanisms with initial evidence were discussed . This review also summarized common method ological issues including a lack of experimental manipulation and inaccurate measuring of meditation practice."
"8Background To investigate the use of  physical activity monitors ( PAMs )  for  the elderly  , the scientific literature should be systematic ally review ed and the effect quantified , as the evidence seems inconclusive .

sDisordered eating is elevated in  bariatric surgery patients  and is a risk factor for poor surgical outcomes . A systematic review evaluated the definitions and measurement methods used to identify and assess disordered eating in  patients following  bariatric surgery .  One hundred articles were  identified featuring 35 question naires and 23 interviews . There were numerous variations to diagnostic criteria and amendments to measures to account for the post-surgical eating context . Only 20 % of question naires and 4 % of interviews had reported psychometric evaluation in post-surgery sample s. Results highlight the need for a consistent definition of  disordered eating  and for current assessment measures to be ( a ) adapted to account for the altered gastrointestinal system in patients following surgery and ( b ) psychometrically evaluated in bariatric surgery patients.
"sBackground :  Resistance training ( RT )  is recommended as part of our national physical activity guidelines which includes working all major muscle groups on two or more days a week .  Older adults  can gain many health benefits from  RT  , such as increased muscle strength , increased muscle mass , and maintenance of bone density . Additionally , certain dimensions of  health-related quality of life ( HRQOL )  have been shown to improve in  older adults  due to  RT  intervention . The purpose of this study was to use systematic review and meta-analytic techniques to examine the effect of  RT  on HRQOL  in older adults .  Methods : A systematic review of current studies ( 2008 thru 2017 ) was conducted using PubMed . Studies were included if they used a r and omized controlled design , had  RT  as an intervention , measured HRQOL using  the SF-36/12 assessment  ,  and included adults 50 + years of age .  Eight dimension scores  ( physical functioning , bodily pain , physical role function , general health , mental health , emotional role function , social function , and vitality )  and two summary scores  ( physical component  and  mental  component ) were extracted . Ten meta-analyses were performed using st and ardized mean effect sizes and r and om effects models . Study quality , moderator and sensitivity analyses were conducted . Results : A  total of 16 studies were included in  the  analyses  with a  mean Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) score  of 4.9 ( SD=1.0 ) . Among the mental health measures ,  RT  had the greatest  effect on mental health  ( Effect size [ES]=0.64 , 95 % CI : 0.30 - 0.99 , I2=79.7 ) . Among the physical health measures ,  RT  had the largest effect  on body pain  ( ES=0.81 , 95 % CI : 0.26 - 1.35 , I2=85.9).Initially  , RT  did not significantly  affect measures of emotional role function , social function or physical role function .  However , after removing a single study  , RT  significantly  increased all HRQOL measures .  Conclusion : The meta-analytic evidence presented in this research clearly supports the  promotion of RT  in improving  HRQOL  in older adults."
"  Multifaceted  professional  interventions  can enhance the  performance  of health professionals in managing patients with diabetes . Organisational interventions that improve  regular prompted recall and review of patients  ( central computerised tracking systems or nurses who regularly contact the patient ) can also improve  diabetes management .  The addition of patient-oriented interventions can lead to improved  patient health outcomes .  Nurses can play an important role in patient-oriented interventions , through patient education or facilitating adherence to treatment."
" This review provides evidence that PRT is an effective intervention for  improving physical functioning  in   older  people  , including  improving strength and the performance of some simple and complex activities .

"sSeveral studies have suggested that  aerobic physical activity  is safe and beneficial for  HIV-infected adults .  However , there is information lacking regarding whether  HIV-infected patients  practice physical activity and to what extent . Therefore , the aim of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence of   physical activity , sedentary lifestyle  or  lack of physical activity   in non-experimental conditions performed by  HIV-infected subjects .  The electronic search was conducted using Medline and EMBASE bibliographic data bases and the platforms of Bireme , Ovid , Science Direct , High Wire and SCIELO from January 1990 to July 2011 . Original observational studies were included . Of  the 2,838 articles found , 48 met the inclusion criteria .  Following data extraction and after reading the manuscripts , 24 were selected for systematic review . Of the 24 studies , most were cross-sectional  studies . The average quality score using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale  was 2.8±1.5 . The diversity of methods used to assess  physical activity  precluded the calculated summary estimate of prevalence . The percentage  of sedentary lifestyle  was determined in 13 articles which conducted studies on  HIV-infected individuals .  The  percentage of sedentary lifestyle or physical inactivity  ranged from 19%to 73 % , with the level determined by different methods . In conclusion , there are few well- design ed studies with adequate sample size to represent the population  of HIV-infected individuals .  A pooled estimate could not be calculated due to the differences in physical activity measurements and definitions of physically active and non-active HIV-infected individuals."
"nObjective To perform a systematic review of published literature for the factors reported to predict outcomes of  enhanced recovery  after  surgery  ( ERAS  ) programmes  following   laparoscopic colorectal surgery .   Background ERAS programmes and the use of  laparoscopy  have been widely adopted in colorectal surgery bringing short-term patient benefit . However , there is a minority of patients that do not benefit from these strategies and their identification is not well characterised . The factors that underpin outcomes from ERAS programmes for  laparoscopic patients  are not understood . Methods A systematic search of the MEDLINE , Embase and Cochrane data bases was conducted to identify  suitable articles published between 2000 and 2015 .  The search strategy captured terms for ERAS , colorectal resection , prediction and outcome measures . Results  Thirty-four studies containing 10,861 laparoscopic resections were included .  Thirty-one ( 91 % ) studies were confined to elective cases . Predictive analysis of outcome was most frequently based on  length of stay ( LOS ) , morbidity and readmission  which were the main outcome measures of 29 ( 85 % ) , 26 ( 76 % ) and 18 ( 53 % ) of the included studies , respectively . Forty-seven percentage of included studies investigated the impact of ERAS programme compliance on these outcomes . Reduced protocol compliance was the most frequently identified modifiable predictive factor for adverse  LOS , morbidity and readmission .  Conclusion Protocol compliance is the most frequently reported predictive factor for outcomes of ERAS programmes following laparoscopic colorectal resection . Reduced compliance increases  LOS , morbidity and readmission  to  hospital .  The impact of compliance with individual ERAS protocol elements is insufficiently studied , and the lack of a st and ardised framework for evaluating ERAS programmes makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions about which factors exert the greatest impact on outcome after laparoscopic colorectal resection."
"lOne reason for doing r and  omised controlled trials ( RCTs )  is that experiments can be convincing . Early epidemiological experimenters , such as Jenner and the smallpox vaccine and Snow and his famous Broad Street pump h and le , already knew the answer they were demonstrating ; they used the experiments as knowledge translation devices to convince others . More sophisticated modern experiments include cluster r and  omised controlled trials  ( C RCTs ) for experiments in the public health setting . The knowledge translation value remains :  RCTs  and  C RCTs  can potentially stimulate changes of practice among stakeholders . Capitalising on the knowledge translation value of  RCTs  requires more than the st and ard reporting of trials . Those who are convinced by a trial and want to act , need to know how the trial relates to their own context , what contributed to success , and what might make it even more effective . Implementation research unpacks the back-story , examining how and why an intervention worked . The  Camino Verde trial of  community mobilisation  for control of dengue  reported a significant impact on  entomological indices of the Aedes aegypti vector  , and on serological dengue virus infection and self-reported dengue cases  .  This important study should lead to studies of similar interventions in other context s , and ultimately to changes in dengue control practice s. This supplement is the back-story of the trial , providing information to help research ers and planners to make use of the trial findings . Background articles include the full protocol , a systematic review of  C RCTs  of  approaches  for  Aedes  aegypti control , epidemiological and entomological findings from the baseline survey , and how baseline findings were used to set up the intervention . Secondary analyses of the entomological findings examine associations with the use of the larvicide temephos , and the impact of the intervention in different conditions of water supply and seasons . Other articles describe implementation and other impacts  :  the underlying approach ; implementation in the trial ’s different social context s ; the  different impact  in  women and men ;  the  effects of using fish for vector control ;  the  impact on household costs of personal protection and of cases of dengue illness ;  and  ethical issues .  We hope this supplement will increase the knowledge translation value of the Camino Verde trial."

"hThe aim of this systematic review was to determine whether there is a  root canal filling for deciduous teeth  equally or more effective than  zinc oxide-eugenol cement ( ZOE ) .   Six clinical trials selected for inclusion  were independently review ed by two research ers . Only two showed statistically significant different  success rates  between the test and the control groups . One found that an  iodoform paste with calcium hydroxide ( IP + Ca )  performed better than  ZOE  , and the other found that  ZOE  performed similarly to  IP + Ca .  The other four studies compared  ZOE  with an  iodoform paste ( IP ) , a calcium hydroxide cement ( Ca(OH)(2 ) ) , or IP + Ca .  In these trials , the  success rates  in the  ZOE  groups were slightly lower than in the other groups . There seems to be no convincing evidence to support the superiority of any material over  ZOE  , and both  ZOE  and  IP + Ca  appear to be suitable as root canal fillings for deciduous teeth."
"sBackground Governments use different approaches to ensure that private for‐profit healthcare services meet certain quality st and ards . Such government guidance , referred to as public stewardship , encompasses government policies , regulatory mechanisms , and implementation strategies for ensuring accountability in the delivery of services . However , the effectiveness of these strategies in  low‐ and middle‐income countries ( LMICs )  have not been the subject of a systematic review . Objectives To assess the effects of  public sector regulation , training  , or  co‐ordination  of the private for‐profit health sector in  low‐ and middle‐income countries .  Search methods For related systematic review s , we search ed the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s ( CDSR ) 2015 , Issue 4 ; Data base of Abstract s of Review s of Effectiveness ( DARE ) 2015 , Issue 1 ; Health Technology Assessment Data base ( HTA ) 2015 , Issue 1 ; all part of The Cochrane Library , and search ed 28 April 2015 .

In addition , in April 2016 , we search ed the reference lists of relevant articles , WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform , Clinical trials.gov , and various electronic data bases of grey literature . Selection criteria R and omised trials , non‐r and omised trials , interrupted time series studies , or controlled before‐after studies . Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data , comparing their results and resolving discrepancies by consensus . We expressed study results  as risk ratios ( RR ) or  mean differences  ( MD  ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) , where appropriate , and assessed the certainty of the evidence using Grade s of Recommendation , Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) . We did not conduct meta‐ analysis because of heterogeneity of interventions and study design s. Main results  We identified 20,177 records , 50 of them potentially eligible .  We excluded  39 potentially eligible studies  because they did not involve a rigorous evaluation of training , regulation , or co‐ordination of  private for‐profit healthcare providers in LMICs ;  five studies identified after the review was su bmi tted are awaiting assessment ; and  six studies  met our inclusion criteria . Two included studies assessed  training alone ;  one  assessed regulation alone ;  three  assessed a multifaceted intervention involving training and regulation ;  and none  assessed co‐ordination .  All six included studies  targeted private for‐profit pharmacy workers in Africa and Asia .  Three studies found that training probably  increases sale of oral rehydration solution  ( one trial in  Kenya  , 106  pharmacies  : RR 3.04 , 95 % CI 1.37 to 6.75 ; and one trial in  Indonesia  , 87 pharmacies : RR 1.41 , 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.93 ) and  dispensing of anti‐malarial drugs  ( one trial in Kenya , 293 pharmacies : RR 8.76 , 95 % CI 0.94 to 81.81 ) ; moderate‐certainty evidence . One study conducted in the  Lao People 's Democratic Republic  shows that regulation of the distribution and sale of registered pharmaceutical products may improve  composite pharmacy indicators  ( one trial , 115 pharmacies : improvements in four of six pharmacy indicators ; low‐certainty evidence ) . The outcome in three multifaceted intervention studies  was the quality of pharmacy practice ; including the ability to ask questions , give advice , and provide appropriate treatment .  The trials applied  regulation , training , and peer influence  in sequence ; and the study design does not permit separation of the effects of the different interventions . Two trials conducted  among 136 pharmacies in Vietnam  found that the multifaceted intervention may  improve the quality of pharmacy practice ;  but the third study ,  involving 146 pharmacies in Vietnam and Thail and  , found that the intervention may have little or no effects  on the quality of pharmacy practice  ( low‐certainty evidence ) . Only two studies ( both conducted in Vietnam ) reported cost data , with no rigorous assessment of the economic implication s of implementing the interventions in re source ‐constrained setting s. No study reported  data on equity , mortality , morbidity , adverse effects , satisfaction , or attitudes  . Authors ' conclusions  Training  probably improves quality of care ( i.e. adherence to recommended practice ) , regulation may improve quality of care , and we are uncertain about the effects of co‐ordination on quality of  private for‐profit healthcare services in LMICs .  The likelihood that further research will find the effect of   training   to be substantially different from the results of this review is moderate ; implying that monitoring of the impact is likely to be needed if training is implemented . The low certainty of the evidence for regulation implies that the likelihood of further research finding the  effect of regulation  to be substantially different from the results of this review is high . Therefore , an impact evaluation is warranted if government regulation of private for‐profit providers is implemented in LMICs . Rigorous evaluations of these interventions should also assess other outcomes such as impacts on equity , cost implication s , mortality , morbidity , and adverse effects."

"eThe role of  nutritional supplementation  is of increasing interest with regard to  ocular disease .  R and omised controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of  supplementation  for age-related macular degeneration , and formulations are now being developed for use by  people with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy .  The aim of this review was to synthesis e the evidence for use of  nutritional supplementation  in  type 2 diabetes .  MEDLINE and EMBASE data bases were search ed using a systematic approach .  Only double-masked r  and  omised controlled  trials were selected .  A total of 50 trials were identified as suitable for inclusion .  The potential role of  alpha-lipoic acid , chromium , folic acid , isoflavones , magnesium , Pycnogenol , selenium , vitamin C , vitamin E , and zinc  in the treatment of type 2 diabetes is discussed . The review of trials identifies positive effects of these nutrients on various  outcome measures  relating  to insulin resistance and cardiovascular factors .   Chromium  was the most studied supplement , accounting for 16 of the 50 trials . A majority of the trials found a positive effect of chromium on  fasting plasma glucose .   Isoflavones  were found to have a positive effect on  insulin resistance and cardiovascular outcome measures  , but only when combined with  soy proteins . Vitamin E  is reported to reduce  oxidative stress  at levels of 200 mg day(-1 ) or more."
"sOBJECTIVE Studies have suggested that even a single session of  physical exercise  enhances  executive functions .  ADHD is among the most common developmental disorders in childhood , but little is known about alternative treatments for this disorder . Therefore , we performed a systematic review of the literature to analyze articles that evaluated the  executive functions  of  children with ADHD after an  acute exercise session .   METHOD We review ed articles indexed in the PubMed  , American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) psychNET , Scopus  ,  and Web of Knowledge data bases between 1980 and 2013 .  RESULTS Of  231 articles selected , only three met  the inclusion criteria .  Based on these 3 articles , we concluded that  30 min of physical exercise  reportedly improved the  executive functions  of  children with ADHD .  Due to the small number of articles selected , further studies are needed to confirm these benefits."
"eThe usefulness of  peak atrial longitudinal strain ( PALS )  in identifying  patients at high risk of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) recurrence after  radiofrequency ablation ( RFA )   has been investigated in several  small AF population s.  The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to investigate whether PALS predicts  recurrence of AF  after RFA treatment . MEDLINE , EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were search ed . Studies investigating the value of PALS in predicting successful RFA in  AF patients  were selected . Patients  underwent echocardiography prior to RFA .   Risk of bias  was evaluated using  the Quality in Prognosis Studies ( QUIPS ) Tool  .  Twelve studies and a total of 1025 patients suffering from paroxysmal or persistent AF were included .   Odds ratios ( OR )  were assessed in a r and om and fixed effects model for univariable and multivariable pooled analyses respectively . PALS was found to be a significant predictor  of AF recurrence  after RFA across study population s ( Univariable : OR : 1.17 , CI95 % [ 1.03–1.34 ] , p = 0.018 , per 1 % decrease ) ( Multivariable : OR : 1.16 , CI95 % [ 1.09–1.24 ] , p < 0.001 , per 1 % decrease ) .  Patients  with  recurrence  had  significantly lower PALS  prior to RFA than  patients who maintained  sinus rhythm ( 15.7 ± 5.7 % vs. 23.0 ± 7.0 % , p = 0.016 ) . A pooled analysis of weighted mean differences ( WMD ) also showed a significant  difference in PALS  between the two groups ( WMD : − 6.57 , CI95 % [ − 8.49 : − 4.65 ] , p < 0.001 ) .  Lower values of PALS  are associated with  an increased risk of AF recurrence  after RFA . PALS provides prognostic value in clinical practice."

"RBackground  Vitamin D  might be promising to serve as an adjunctive therapy for  pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) .  However , the results remained controversial . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  vitamin D  in  patients with pulmonary TB .  Methods Medline , SCOPUS , Google Scholar , EMBASE , Springer , and Science Direct were search ed electronically from inception to Oct 2016 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and controlled clinical trials ( CCTs ) assessing the effect of  vitamin D plus anti-tuberculosis treatment  ( ATT  )  versus  placebo plus ATT  on the treatment of pulmonary TB were included . Two investigators independently search ed articles , extracted data , and assessed the quality of included studies . Data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3 software . Results  Five studies were included  in this meta- analysis . Overall , compared with  placebo  intervention  , vitamin D supplementation  was found to have no significant effect on  sputum smear negative conversion rates  ( RR=0.99 ; 95 % CI=0.91 to 1.07 ; P=0.77 ) ,  BMI  ( MD=0.11 ; 95 % CI=-0.85 to 1.07 ; P=0.82 ) and  ESR  ( MD=-2.29 ; 95 % CI=-8.87 to 4.30 ; P=0.50 ) .  Conclusion Vitamin D supplementation  showed no influence on the improvement of  sputum smear-negative conversion rates and BMI  , as well as the decrease in ESR."

"sTestosterone products are recommended by some prescribers in response to a diagnosis or presumption of "" low testosterone "" ( low-T ) for cardiovascular  health  , sexual function , muscle weakness or wasting , mood and behavior , and cognition . We performed a systematic review of  156 eligible r and omized controlled trials in which  testosterone  was compared to  placebo  for one or more of these conditions .  We included  studies in bibliographic data bases between January 1 , 1950 and April 9 , 2016 , and excluded studies involving bodybuilding , contraceptive effectiveness , or treatment of any condition in women or children .  Studies with multiple relevant endpoints were included in all relevant tables .  Testosterone supplementation  did not show consistent  benefit for cardiovascular risk , sexual function , mood and behavior , or cognition .  Studies that examined  clinical cardiovascular endpoints  have not favored  testosterone therapy  over  placebo . Testosterone  is ineffective in  treating erectile dysfunction  and controlled trials did not show a consistent effect  on libido .   Testosterone  supplementation consistently  increased muscle strength  but did not have  beneficial effects on physical function .  Most studies on  mood-related endpoints  found  no beneficial effect  of  testosterone  treatment  on personality , psychological well-being , or mood .  The prescription of  testosterone supplementation  for low-T  for cardiovascular health , sexual function , physical function , mood , or cognitive function  is without support from r and omized clinical trials."
"nPURPOSE OF REVIEW To underst and the basis for current recommendations for   vitamin D supplementation  in childhood  and the differences between the recommendations published by major expert committees , using the Medline engine of the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health . RECENT FINDINGS Recent recommendations published by major national expert committees are essentially based on expert opinion ( a relatively low level of evidence ) . R and omized controlled trials are very few , and there are no systematic review s or meta-analyses on the topic . Most trials have examined the question of whether a specific daily  vitamin D  dose is capable or not to prevent rickets ( by study ing surrogate markers of rickets ) . There are no trials that have systematic ally attempted to determine the upper limit of daily  vitamin D  dose beyond which its  toxic effects  may appear . Whether or not outcomes such as  osteoporosis ( or low bone mass )  and specific  types of cancer  may be prevented by ' generous '  vitamin D supplementation  is unclear and mostly based on indirect epidemiologic data not clearly substantiated by r and omized controlled trials SUMMARY The dose of daily  vitamin D  supplements needed to prevent rickets is probably much lower than that recommended by most expert committees . Whether higher doses of daily  vitamin D  supplements may or may not prevent other poor outcomes such as  adult osteoporosis  or specific types of  cancer  is not yet known."
" The identified studies comprehensively address the objectives of the present review .Based on these results , antidepressants may be more effective than  placebo  in treating panic disorder . Efficacy can be quantified as a NNTB of 7 , implying that seven people need to be treated with antidepressants in order for one to benefit . Antidepressants may also have benefit in comparison with  placebo  in terms of  number of dropouts  , but a less favourable profile in terms of  dropout  due to  adverse effects .  However , the  tolerability profile  varied between different classes of antidepressants . The choice of whether antidepressants should be prescribed in clinical practice can not be made on the basis of this review . Limitations in results include funding of some studies by pharmaceutical companies , and only assessing short-term outcomes . Data from the present review will be included in a network meta- analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic  disorder  , which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue."
"nLittle is known about the dimensions of  osteoporosis prevention programs  essential to changing health behaviors . The purpose of this review was to determine the impact of select characteristics of  structured osteoporosis prevention programs  on calcium intake in  women .  This systematic review included  12 experimental and quasi-experimental studies conducted internationally with adult women participants .  Studies were more likely to demonstrate differences when they were conducted outside the U.W. ; participants had lower baseline calcium intake ; and interventions were multi-dimensional and included  factual information , skill training , and social contact delivered dynamically over time  . The results document extensive variability across participants , programs , and measures . There is a need to document the source ( total and sub-total ) of calcium intake , to provide the necessary data to calculate effect sizes to enable comparison across studies , and to identify those moderating factors ( such as menopausal status ) that affect the ability to determine differences between sub-groups . Results indicate  health behavior change  is more likely to occur when  patient-centered interventions design  ed to increase  knowledge and  health beliefs , skills  and  abilities   , and   social facilitation   are delivered over time . There is an urgent need for the development and testing of new health behavior change theories , prevention programs , and delivery media to support and complement health care providers in the prevention and management of this common , debilitating condition."
" The majority of the studies included did not describe a complete procedure of  HGS  measurement . The high heterogeneity between the protocol s used , in sarcopenia and frailty studies , create an enormous difficulty in drawing comparative conclusions among them."
"yBACKGROUND The minimal clinical ly  important difference  (  MCID  ) is used when interpreting the importance of outcome data . However , a consensus regarding the  MCID  for commonly used patient-reported outcomes in  shoulder  surgery has not been established . The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on shoulder  MCID  to improve clinical interpretation of shoulder outcome data . METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify studies reporting anchor-based  MCID  values for the  patient-reported outcomes  recommended by the  American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons ( ASES )  : Veterans R  and  12 score   ,  ASES score  ,  Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation ( SANE ) score  ,  Western Ontario Rotator Cuff ( WORC ) score  ,  Western Ontario Osteoarthritis Score ( WOOS )  ,  Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index ( WOSI ) , Pennsylvania Shoulder Score  , and  Oxford Shoulder Score ( OSS ) .  RESULTS A total of  14  articles reporting anchor-based MCID values were included in the final analysis . No studies reporting the  Western Ontario Osteoarthritis Score ( WOOS )  were identified . The  ASES score  ( 6 studies ) ,  OSS  ( 4 studies ) , and  WORC score  ( 2 studies ) were the only instruments investigated in more than 1 study . The average reported  MCID values  for the  ASES , OSS , and WORC scores  were 15.5 ( 15 % total difference ) , 275.7 ( 13 % total difference ) , and 6 ( 13 % total difference ) , respectively . The vast majority of studies failed to report information necessary to vali date the credibility of these MCID values . DISCUSSION AND  The current utility of the  MCID  for patient-report shoulder outcome instruments is limited by poor study methodology , inadequate reporting , and a lack of data . Further research is needed to more clearly define the MCID values for commonly used patient-reported outcomes in shoulder surgery."
"yBACKGROUND A recent review concluded that  general health checks  fail to reduce  mortality in adults .  AIM This review focuses on  general practice -based health checks  and their effects on both surrogate and final outcomes . DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic search of PubMed , Embase , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . METHOD Relevant data were extracted from r and omised trials comparing the health outcomes of   general practice -based health checks versus usual care  in middle-aged population s.  RESULTS  Six trials were included  . The end-point differences between the intervention and  control  arms in  total cholesterol ( TC ) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( SBP , DBP ) , and body mass index ( BMI )  were -0.13 mmol/l ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = -0.19 to -0.07 ) , -3.65 mmHg ( 95 % CI = -6.50 to -0.81 ) , -1.79 mmHg ( 95 % CI = -2.93 to -0.64 ) , and -0.45 kg/m(2 ) ( 95 % CI = -0.66 to -0.24 ) , respectively . The odds of a patient  remaining  at  ' high risk '  with  elevated TC , SBP , DBP , BMI or continuing smoking  were 0.63 ( 95 % CI = 0.50 to 0.79 ) , 0.59 ( 95 % CI = 0.28 to 1.23 ) , 0.63 ( 95 % CI = 0.53 to 0.74 ) , 0.89 ( 95 % CI = 0.81 to 0.98 ) , and 0.91 ( 95 % CI = 0.82 to 1.02 ) , respectively . There was little evidence of a difference in  total mortality  ( OR 1.03 , 95 % CI = 0.90 to 1.18 ) . Higher  CVD mortality  was observed in the intervention group ( OR 1.30 , 95 % CI = 1.02 to 1.66 ) .   General practice -based health checks  are associated with statistically significant , albeit clinical ly small , improvements in surrogate outcome control , especially among  high-risk patients .  Most studies were not originally design ed to assess mortality."

"sBackground Physical fitness during childhood and adolescence has been identified as an important determinant of current and future health status . While research has traditionally focused on the association between cardio-respiratory fitness and health outcomes , the association between  muscular fitness  ( MF ) and health status has recently received increased attention . Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to evaluate the potential physiological and psychological benefits associated with  MF among children and adolescents .  Methods A systematic search of  six electronic data bases  ( PubMed , SPORTD iscus , Scopus , EMBASE , PsycINFO and OVID  MEDLINE )  was performed on the  20th May , 2013 .  Cross-sectional , longitudinal and experimental studies that quantitatively examined the association between MF and potential health benefits  among children and adolescents  were included . The search yielded  110 eligible studies  , encompassing six health outcomes ( i.e. ,  adiposity , bone health , cardiovascular disease [ CVD ] and metabolic risk factors , musculoskeletal pain , psychological health and cognitive ability )  . The percentage of studies reporting statistically significant associations between MF and the outcome of interest was used to determine the strength of the evidence for an association and additional coding was conducted to account for risk of bias . Meta-analyses were also performed to determine the pooled effect size if there were at least three studies providing st and ardised coefficients . Results Strong evidence was found for an inverse association  between MF and total and central adiposity , and CVD and metabolic risk factors  . The pooled effect size for the relationship between  MF and adiposity  was r = −0.25 ( 95 % CI −0.41 to −0.08 ) . Strong evidence was also found for a positive  association between MF and bone health and self-esteem  . The pooled effect size for the relationship between MF  and perceived sports competence  was r = 0.39 ( 95 % CI 0.34–0.45 ) . The evidence for an association  between MF and musculoskeletal pain and cognitive ability  was inconsistent/uncertain . Where evidence of an association was found , the associations were generally low to moderate . Conclusion The findings of this review highlight the importance of developing  MF in youth  for a number of health-related benefits."
">We summarized  16 controlled studies and  evaluated the correlation of   resveratrol supplementation   with  metabolic parameters  such as  the body weight , waist circumference ( WC ) , systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , HDL , total cholesterol , triglyceride and glucose levels .  This meta- analysis was carried out to determine the association between the  resveratrol  intake with metabolic parameters in  metabolic syndrome patients .  PubMed , Scopus , Cochrane and Google Scholar were search ed from inception to December 2018 using relevant keywords . All articles were independently review ed by two authors using predetermined selection criteria . We have selected the studies that investigated the effects of  resveratrol  on  metabolic parameters  .  Of 16 studies , 10 were performed on human subjects , and in 6 studies animal models were used .  St and ard mean difference ( SMD ) with 95 % confidence interval were determined using Der Simonian and Laird r and om-effects modeling , when there was a significant heterogeneity between studies . Funnel plot and Egger ’s test were conducted to examine the risk of publication bias . Pooled effect sizes in human studies indicated a significant impact of resveratrol supplementation  on glucose level  [ −1.73 ( −2.99 , −0.47 ) ; p = 0.007 ) ]  and WC  [ −1.73 ( −2.79 , −0.67 ) ; p = 0.001 ] compared with the control group . Also combining the results of studies on  rat sample  s ( n  = 6 )  , indicated significant effect  of resveratrol  on  decreasing weight  [ −22.95 ( −44.74 , −1.17 ) ; p =  0.04 ] , TGs  [ −6.76 ( −11.10 , −2.42 ) ;  p = 0.001 ] , sbp  [ −7.30 ( −12.48 , −2.13 ) ; p = 0.006 ] , and it can influence significantly  on increasing HDL level  ( 4.75 ( 1.87 , 7.63 ) ; p = 0.001 ) .  However ,  resveratrol was not significantly effective  on total cholesterol  in both sample s. The results of subgroup analysis of human studies showed  that resveratrol  has significant  effect on metabolic parameters ( glucose level and WC )  at the dosage of > 500 mg and with long-term interventions ≥ 10 weeks . Administration  of resveratrol  can meaningfully  reduce the BW , WC , TGs , and glucose level  , also it can  increase HDL , but not total cholesterol ."

" Overall , strong levels of evidence exist for iPhone and scoliometer measurements , with a high to very high reliability and moderate to very high  validity  . Moderate levels of evidence exist for scoliometer with mathematical formula and clinical examination with moderate and low validity , respectively . Limited evidence exists for  aesthetic tools TRACE  and  AI  and  2D  photography . These results indicate there are accurate and reproducible  anthropometric measures  that are inexpensive and applicable in therapy setting s to assess  postural  asymmetry ; however , these only exist for measurement in the transverse plane , despite 3D characteristics of AIS . Further research is required into an inexpensive and easily administered method that can assess  postural  asymmetry in all anatomical planes."
"sBackground  Cash transfers and vouchers  are forms of ‘ dem and -side financing ’ that have been widely used to promote  maternal and newborn health in low- and middle-income countries  during the last 15 years . Methods This systematic review consoli date s evidence from  seven published systematic review s  on the effects of different types of  cash transfers and vouchers  on the  use and quality of maternity care services  , and up date s the systematic search es  to June 2015  using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach for systematic review ing . The review protocol for this up date was registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42015020637 ) . Results Data from  51 studies ( 15 more than previous review s ) and 22  cash transfer and voucher programmes   suggest that approaches tied to service use ( either via  payment conditionalities  or  vouchers  for selected services ) can increase  use of antenatal care  , use of a  skilled attendant  at birth and in the case of  vouchers  , postnatal care too . The strongest evidence of positive effect was for  conditional cash transfers  and uptake of antenatal care , and for  vouchers  for maternity care services and birth with a skilled birth attendant . However , effects appear to be shaped by a complex set of social and healthcare system barriers and facilitators . Studies have typically focused on an initial programme period , usually two or three years after initiation , and many lack a counterfactual comparison with supply-side investment . There are few studies to indicate that programmes have led to improvements in  quality of maternity care or maternal and newborn health outcomes .  Conclusion Future research should use multiple intervention arms to compare cost-effectiveness with similar investment in public services , and should look beyond short- to medium-term service utilisation by examining programme costs , longer-term effects on  service utilisation  and  health outcomes  , and the equity of those effects."

"pBackground  Total hip arthroplasty ( THA )  is increasingly performed in  younger patients  despite the lack of comprehensive assessment of long-term outcomes . We systematic ally review ed the contemporary literature to assess the  1 ) indications , 2 ) implant selection and long-term survivorship , 3 ) complication and reoperation rates and 4 ) radiographic and functional outcomes  of  primary  THA  in patients younger than 55 years .  Methods We search ed the Embase  and MEDLINE data bases for English- language articles published between 2000 and 2018 that reported outcomes of  primary THA  in patients younger than 55 years with a minimum follow-up duration of 10 years .  Results  Thirty-two studies reporting on 3219  THA  procedures performed in 2434 patients met our inclusion criteria . The most common preoperative diagnoses were avascular necrosis ( 1044 [ 32.4 % ] ) , osteoarthritis ( 870 [ 27.0 % ] ) and developmental dysplasia of the hip ( 627 [ 19.5 % ] ) .   Modular implants  ( 3001 [ 93.2 % ] ) ,  cementless fixation  ( 2214 [ 68.8 % ] ) and  metal-on-polyethylene bearings  ( 1792 [ 55.7 % ] ) were frequently used . The  mean 5- and 10-year survival rates  were 98.7 % and 94.6 % , respectively . Data  on survival beyond 10 years  were heterogeneous , with values of 27%–99.5 % at 10–14 years , 59%–84 % at 15–19 years , 70%–77 % at 20–24 years and 60 % at 25–30  years . Rates of dislocation , deep infection and reoperation  for any reason were 2.4 % , 1.2 % and 16.3 % , respectively .  The mean Harris Hip Score  improved from 43.6/100 to 91.0/100 . Conclusion Total  hip arthroplasty in patients younger than 55 years  provides reliable outcomes at up to 10 years .

"sBACKGROUND Menopause is a critical phenomenon in women 's life . After cardiac diseases , menopause is the second major cause of living with a disability in  45 - 60 year old women .  The majority of women will experience bothersome   vasomotor symptoms ( VMS )  .   Menopausal hormone therapy ( MHT )  is the most effective treatment for these symptoms . The objective of this review is to focus on  hormone therapy  for relieving  postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms .  METHODS For this systematic review , we primarily explored  125 papers published about  hormone therapy  for VMS from 2001 to 2015 by search ing with combinations of the keywords in various data bases .  Among those ,  59 papers met  the  initial search criteria  and among them , 9 papers were potentially retrievable and review ed . All included studies used  estrogen formulations  in the management of VMS  .  RESULTS Nine studies met all inclusion criteria . All studies assessed the  effects of  hormone replacement therapy  on VSM .  The results showed that low-dose oral and transdermal  estrogen  in all dose ranges were more likely than  placebo  to decrease the  frequency of VMS .  Indeed , the nanostructured formulation was  safe and effective in relieving the symptoms of menopause .  The mean daily decrease  in the number of hot flashes from baseline  was found in the studies .   MHT  has a complex pattern . Underst and ing the natural history of  VMS  , and the risks and benefits of both hormonal therapies , helps to individualize management plans .  Low-dose estrogen-based therapies  can be the most effective regimens to relieve  VMS .  These medications can be used by different administration routes and formulations."
"sSome believe that certain  patients with intermittent claudication  may be unsuitable for  supervised exercise therapy ( SET )  , based on the presence of comorbidities and the possibly increased risks . We conducted a systematic review ( MEDLINE , EMBASE and CENTRAL ) to summarize evidence on the potential influence of diabetes mellitus  (  DM ) on the response to  SET .  R and omized and nonr and omized studies that investigated the effect of  DM  on walking distance after SET in  patients with IC  were included . Considered outcome measures were  maximal , pain-free and functional walking distance ( MWD , PFWD and FWD )  .  Three articles met the inclusion criteria ( n = 845 ) .  In one study  , MWD  was 111 meters ( 128 % ) longer in the  non-DM  group compared to the  DM  group after 3 months of follow-up ( p = 0.056 ) . In a second study , the non-DM group demonstrated a significant  increase in PFWD  ( 114 meters , p ⩽ 0.05 ) after 3 months of follow-up , whereas there was no statistically significant increase for  the DM  group ( 54 meters ) . On the contrary , the largest study of this review did not demonstrate any adverse effect of   DM  on MWD and FWD  after SET . In conclusion , the data evaluating the effects of  DM  on SET were inadequate to determine if  DM  impairs the exercise response . While trends in the data do not suggest an impairment , they are not conclusive . Practitioners should consider this limitation when making clinical decisions."
"yAbstract Background : Previous studies reported inconsistent findings regarding the effects of  psyllium supplementation  on   obesity measures .   This systematic review and meta- analysis was performed to summarize data from available r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) on the effect of  psyllium supplementation  on   body weight , body mass index ( BMI )  , and  waist circumference ( WC )  in adults .  Methods : PubMed , SCOPUS , Cochrane Library , and Google Scholar were search ed to identify relevant articles  up to  August 2018 . The effect sizes were presented as weighted mean difference ( WMD ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) by using r and om effects model . To detect dose-response relationships , we used fractional polynomial modeling . Results :  A total of 22 RCTs were included .  Meta- analysis did not find any significant effect  of psyllium supplementation   on body weight  ( MD : −0.28 kg , 95 % CI : −0.78 , 0.21 , p = 0.268 )  , BMI  ( MD : −0.19 kg/m2 , 95 % CI : −0.55 , 0.15 , p = 0.27 )  and WC  ( MD : −1.2 cm , 95 % CI : −2.6 , 0.2 , p = 0.09 ) . Subgroup analysis showed that  psyllium  dosage  , kind of  psyllium  administration , duration of trial , study design , sample size , and gender  were potential sources of heterogeneity . Moreover , there was nonlinear association  between duration of  psyllium  consumption , BMI and WC  .  Conclusion  :  Psyllium  supplementation does not  reduce body weight , BMI , and WC  significantly."

"nOBJECTIVE To assess whether  progesterone  ( P4 ) or osteoblast P4 receptor-acting  progestin  ( P ) contributed to  estrogen ( E ) therapy-related   increased areal bone mineral density ( BMD )  in r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) with direct r and omization to  estrogen ( ET ) or estrogen-progestin ( EPT ) therapy .  METHODS Systematic literature search es in biomedical data bases identified RCT with direct r and omization and parallel estrogen doses that measured  spinal BMD change/year  .  Cyclic P4/P  was included in this r and om effects meta- analysis only if for ≥ half the number of E-days . RESULTS Search es yielded  155 publications ; five met  inclusion criteria providing eight dose-parallel ET-EPT  comparisons in 1058 women . Women averaged mid-50 years , ⟨five years into menopause  and  took conjugated equine E  daily at 0.625 mg  with/without 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA )  .  The weighted  mean EPT minus ET  percentage difference in spinal BMD change  was + 0.68%/year ( 95 % CI 0.38 , 0.97 % ) ( P=0.00001 ) . This result was highly heterogeneous ( I²=81 % ) but this may reflect the small number of studies .    Estrogen with an osteoblast P4R-acting progestin ( EPT ) in these five published RCT provides Level 1 evidence  that  MPA caused  significantly greater annual percent spinal BMD  gains than the same dose  of ET  . These data have implication s for management of vasomotor symptoms and potentially for osteoporosis treatment in menopausal women."
"tOBJECTIVE To determine the method ological quality of clinical trials that examined possible interactions of  St John 's wort  with conventional drugs , and to examine the results of these trials . DESIGN Systematic review . DATA SOURCES Electronic data bases from inception to April 2004 , reference lists from published reports , and experts in the field . STUDY SELECTION  Eligible studies were prospect i ve clinical trials evaluating  the  pharmacokinetic effect of  St  John  's wort  on the metabolism of conventional drugs .  DATA EXTRACTION Two review ers selected studies for inclusion and independently extracted data . DATA SYNTHESIS  22 pharmacokinetic trials studied an average of 12 ( SD 5 ) participants ; 17 trials studied healthy volunteers and five studied patients .  Most ( 17 ) studies used a "" before and after "" design ; four studies used control groups other than the active group . Three studies r and omised the sequence of administration or the participants to study arms or periods ; three studies blinded participants or investigators . In 15 trials , investigators independently assayed the herb . Of 19 trials with available plasma data , three found no important  interaction  ( change in area under the curve < 20 % ) and 17 found a decrease  in systemic bioavailability of the conventional drug ;  in seven studies the 95 % confidence interval excluded a decrease of < 20 % .  Clinicians and patients should beware of possible decreases in the  systemic bioavailability of conventional drugs  when taken concomitantly with St John  's  wort."

"sSeveral decades of research have focused on the impact of exposure to postnatal depression on children , while anxiety has been largely overlooked . Estimates of the prevalence of postnatal maternal anxiety ( PMA ) range from 3 % to 43 % , suggesting PMA may be an important risk factor for adverse outcomes in  children  . This review summarizes what is known about the effects of   PMA  exposure on children  and makes recommendations for future research . A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE ® and PsychINFO  ® through 2008  identified  18 studies that evaluated child outcomes associated with  PMA  exposure .  Identified studies covered three domains  : somatic , developmental , and psychological outcomes .  The strongest evidence for an adverse effect of  PMA  exposure is in  somatic and psychological outcomes ;  the evidence for an effect of  PMA  on child development is inconclusive . Method ological differences among the studies make comparisons difficult and there are a number of common limitations that challenge the validity of these studies."
"nProprotein  convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) monoclonal antibodies  are powerful lipid-lowering drugs which have been shown to improve clinical endpoints in  patients with hypercholesterolemia .  However , it is not clear how effective  PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies  are for  patients at high cardiovascular risk .  Also , whether the effectiveness of  PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies  varies between different drug types , dosages , race , and indications for  PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies  remains unclear . Therefore , we used recently published studies to systematic ally evaluate the efficacy and safety of  PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies  by analyzing the lipid profiles , adverse events , and clinical endpoints in  patients at high cardiovascular risk .  R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing  PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies  with  placebos  or  active drugs  in  patients at high cardiovascular risk  were retrieved from electronic data bases from their inception until November 2019 .  Efficacy and safety outcomes included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and other lipid profiles , treatment-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) and adverse events of interests , and clinical endpoints .  Subgroup analyses based on drug types , dosing , and race were conducted . Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 15.1 and RevMan 5.0 .  Thirty-two RCTs were included in the systematic review , and 25 of them ( 57,090 individuals ) were included in the meta- analysis .   PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies  significantly  improved LDL-C and other lipid profiles  ( P < 0.05 ) , and no racial differences were found . A recommended dose of 140 mg  of evolocumab  every 2 weeks was likely to produce a relatively stronger effect than  150  mg  of alirocumab  every 2 weeks in terms of the absolute change ( weighted mean differences ( WMD ) − 0.36 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) − 0.71 to − 0.01 ; P = 0.041 ) and percent change ( WMD − 19.53 ; 95 % CI − 32.02 to − 7.04 ;  P = 0.002 ) in LDL-C levels  .  Overall , PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies  were safe , except for the  significantly increased risk of injection site reactions  ( relative risks ( RR ) 1.54 ; 95 % CI 1.38–1.71 ; P < 0.001 ) . Both alirocumab ( RR 0.89 ; 95 % CI 0.83–0.95 ; P < 0.001 ) and evolocumab ( RR 0.86 ; 95 % CI 0.80–0.92 ; P < 0.001 ) were associated with a lower  risk of major cardiovascular events ( MACEs )  , especially in secondary preventive patients  ( alirocumab  group : RR 0.88 ; 95 % CI 0.82–0.95 ; P < 0.001 ;  evolocumab  group : RR 0.86 ; 95 % CI 0.80–0.92 ; P < 0.001 ) . The  reduction in  MACEs was observed in White but not in Asian subjects . No significant  reduction of all-cause mortality  was found ( RR 0.88 ; 95 % CI 0.72–1.07 ; P = 0.182 ) . Both  alirocumab and evolocumab  are  well tolerated  and can greatly  improve lipid profiles  for  patients at high  cardiovascular risk . Both PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies significantly  reduce the risk of nonfatal MACEs  in patients with previous cardiovascular events , but the effect  on  all-cause mortality remains uncertain."
" The results indicate that  MIS THA  is a  safe surgical  procedure , without increases in  operative time , blood loss , operative complication rates and component malposition rates .  However , the beneficial effect of  MIS THA  on functional recovery has to be proven . The results also indicate that  CAS THA  , though result ing in an increase in  operative time  , may have a positive effect on  operative blood loss and operative complication rates .  More importantly , the use of  CAS  results in better positioning of acetabular component of the prosthesis."
" There was low to moderate quality evidence that  BHT  in various forms and doses is more effective than  placebo  for treating moderate to severe  menopausal hot flushes .  There was low to moderate quality evidence of  higher rates of adverse effects such as headache , vaginal bleeding , breast tenderness and skin reactions  in the  BHT  group . There was some evidence to suggest that higher doses of  BHT  are associated with  greater effectiveness  but also with  higher risk of adverse effects .  Although all the included studies used unopposed estrogen , it is recommended best practice to use  progestogen  therapy in women with a uterus taking estrogen in order to avoid endometrial hyperplasia , regardless of the source of the estrogen . No data are yet available about the  safety  of  BHT  with regard to long-term outcomes such as  heart attack , stroke and breast cancer .  There was no good evidence of a difference in effectiveness between  BHT  and  CEE  , and findings with regard to  adverse effects  were inconsistent . The quality of the evidence was too low to reach any firm conclusions .The main limitations in the quality of the evidence were study risk of bias ( mainly due to poor reporting of methods ) , imprecision and lack of data suitable for analysis."
"dA systematic review and meta- analysis was conducted of studies that address the  association of bile acid ( BA ) with obesity  and of studies on the effects of  treatment  in  patients with obesity  on BA metabolism , assessed from systemic BA , fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) , 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one ( C4 ) level , and faecal BA . We search ed  PubMed , Embase  ,  and the Cochrane Library from inception to 1 August 2019  using the keywords  obesity , obese , body mass index , and overweight with bile acid , FGF19 , FXR , and TGR5 .  Two review ers independently search ed , selected , and assessed the quality of studies . Data were analysed using either fixed or r and om effect models with inverse variance weighting .  Of 3771 articles , 33 papers were relevant for the association of BA with obesity of which 22 were included in the meta- analysis , and 50 papers were relevant for the effect of obesity interventions on BA of which 20 were included in the meta- analysis .   Circulating fasting total BA  was not associated with obesity  . FGF19  was inversely  and faecal BA excretion  was positively associated with obesity  . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB )  and  sleeve gastrectomy (  SG  )   modulated BA metabolism  ,  ie  ,  increased BA and FGF19  . Our results  indicate that BA metabolism  is altered in obesity .  Certain bariatric surgeries including RYGB and  SG modulate  BA  , whether these underlie the beneficial effect of the treatment should be investigated."
"eObesity continues to increase in prevalence worldwide . Hypertension has long been associated with obesity , and weight loss continues to be a first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension .  Lifestyle modification  and  pharmacologic therapy  , however , often meet with treatment failure .  Bariatric surgery  continues to be the most successful approach to sustained  weight loss .  This review focuses on the underlying physiologic mechanisms of obesity-hypertension , and the impact of  bariatric surgery  on the treatment of hypertension . Current available literature on the physiologic mechanisms of obesity-hypertension , and the major trials , meta-analyses and systematic review s of the impact of  bariatric surgery  procedures on hypertension are review ed . Evidence suggests significant improvement in  obesity-hypertension  in  patients who undergo surgical weight-reduction procedures .  Malabsorptive techniques such as the  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  or  surgical resection  techniques such as  laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy  appear to offer superior results in regards to  hypertension control  over restrictive techniques such as  Gastric B and ing .  Though long-term control of  hypertension  following surgery remains a concern , available follow-up post-operative data of up to 10 years suggests a sustained , if lessened , effect on  hypertension control  over time."
"eOBJECTIVE To make recommendations on the use of  neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy  in  addition to surgery  in  patients with resectable gastric cancer ( T1 - 4 , N1 - 2 , M0 ) .  OPTIONS  Neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatments compared with "" curative "" surgery alone .  OUTCOMES  Overall survival , disease-free survival , and adverse effects .  EVIDENCE The MEDLINE , CANCERLIT and Cochrane Library data bases and relevant conference proceedings were search ed to identify r and omized trials . VALUES Evidence was selected and review ed by one  member of the Cancer Care Ontario Practice Guidelines Initiative ( CCOPGI ) Gastrointestinal Cancer Disease Site Group and method ologists .  A systematic review of the published literature was combined with a consensus process around the interpretation of the evidence in the context of conventional practice , to develop an evidence -based practice guideline . This report has been review ed and approved by the Gastrointestinal Cancer Disease Site Group , comprising  medical  oncologists  , radiation oncologists , surgeons  , a pathologist and 2 community representatives . BENEFITS  , HARMS  AND COSTS When compared with  surgery alone  , at 3 years  adjuvant chemoradiotherapy  has been shown to increase  overall survival  by 9 % ( 50 % v. 41 % , p = 0.005 ) and to improve  relapse-free survival  from 31 % to 48 % ( p = 0.001 ) . At 5 years , it has been shown to increase  overall survival  by 11.6 % ( 40 % v. 28.4 % ) and to improve  relapse-free survival  from 25 % to 38 % ( p < 0.001 ) . Treatment has been associated with  toxic deaths  in 1 % of patients . The most frequent adverse effects ( > grade 3 [ Southwest Oncology Group toxicity scale ] are  hematologic  ( 54 % ) ,  gastrointestinal  ( 33 % ) ,  influenza-like  ( 9 % ) ,  infectious  ( 6 % ) and  neurologic  ( 4 % ) . The radiation fields used can possibly damage  the left kidney  , result ing in  hypertension and other renal problems .  Furthermore , this therapy could increase the  dem and on radiation re sources .  Physicians and patients should underst and the tradeoffs between  survival benefit and toxicity and cost  before making treatment decisions . RECOMMENDATIONS After surgical resection , patients whose tumours have penetrated the muscularis propria or involve regional lymph nodes should be considered for  adjuvant combined chemoradiotherapy .  The current st and ard protocol consists of 1 cycle of  5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU )  ( 425 mg/m2 daily ) and  leucovorin  ( 20 mg/m2 daily ) administered daily for 5 days , followed 1 month later by 45 Gy ( 1.8 Gy/d ) of  radiation  given with  5-FU  ( 400 mg/m2 daily ) and  leucovorin  ( 20 mg/m2 daily ) on days 1 through 4 and the last 3 days of radiation . One month after completion of radiation , 2 cycles of  5-FU  ( 425 mg/m2 daily ) and  leucovorin  ( 20 mg/m2 daily ) in a daily regimen for 5 days are given at monthly intervals . There is no evidence on which to make a recommendation for  patients with node-negative tumours that have not penetrated the muscularis propria .  For patients unable to undergo radiation ,  adjuvant chemotherapy  alone may be of benefit , particularly for those with lymph-node metastases . The optimal regimen remains to be defined . There is insufficient evidence from r and omized trials to recommend  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  , or  neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy or immunotherapy  , either alone or in combination , outside a clinical trial . VALIDATION A draft version of this document was circulated to  166 clinicians  using  a 21-item feedback question naire . Ninety-nine ( 63 % ) returned the question  naire , and 74 of these indicated that the guideline was relevant to their clinical practice and completed the survey . Of the  74 clinicians  , 52 ( 70 % ) agreed that the document should be approved as a practice guideline .

" This review adds to the Bone and Joint Decade 2000 to 2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders by defining more specifically the role of structured patient education in the management of WAD and NAD . Results suggest that structured patient education alone can not be expected to yield large  benefits  in  clinical effectiveness  compared with other conservative interventions for  patients  with  WAD or NAD  . Moreover , structured patient education may be of benefit during the recovery of patients with WAD when used as an adjunct therapy to physiotherapy or emergency room care . These benefits are small and short lived."
"sNeck pain and whiplash injuries are a common presentation to the ED , and a frequent cause of disability globally . This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of  musculoskeletal neck pain  in the ED . PubMed , CINAHL , EMBASE , TRIP and the grey literature , including relevant organisational websites , were search ed in 2017 . Primary studies , systematic review s and guidelines were considered for inclusion .  English- language articles published in the past 12 years addressing  acute neck pain  assessment , management or prognosis in the ED  were included . Data extraction was conducted , followed by quality appraisal to rate levels of evidence where possible . The  search revealed 2080 articles , of which 51 were included ( n = 22 primary articles , n = 13 systematic review s and n = 16 guidelines ) .  Consistent evidence was found to support the use of  '  red flags ' to screen for serious pathologies , judicious use of imaging through clinical decision rule application and promotion of functional exercise coupled with advice and reassurance . Clinicians may also consider applying risk-stratification methods , such as using a clinical prediction rule , to guide patient discharge and referral plans ; however , the evidence is still emerging in this population . This rapid review provides  clinicians managing neck pain in the ED  a summary of the best available evidence to enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes."
"dBackground  Activity monitoring devices  are currently being used to facilitate and monitor  physical activity .  No prior review has examined adherence to the use of  activity monitoring devices  amongst  adults with cardiovascular disease .  Methods Literature from June  2012 to  October  2017  was evaluated to examine the extent of adherence to any  activity monitoring device  used to collect objective physical  activity  data . R and omized control trials comparing  usual care  against the  use of an activity monitoring device  , in a community intervention for  adults from any cardiovascular diagnostic group  , were included . A systematic search of data bases and clinical trials registers was conducted using Joanna Briggs Institute methodology . Results Of  10 eligible studies  , two studies reported   pedometer  use  and eight   accelerometer  use .  Six studies addressed the primary outcome  . Mean adherence  was 59.1 % ( range 39.6 % to 85.7 % ) at last follow-up . Studies lacked equal representation by  gender ( 28.6 % female ) and age ( range 42 to 82 years ) .  Conclusion This review indicates that current research on activity monitoring devices may be overstated due to the variability in adherence . Results showed that  physical activity tracking  in women and in young adults have been understudied."
"sNon-cholesterol  sterols  are vali date d biomarkers for intestinal cholesterol absorption and endogenous cholesterol synthesis . However , their use in metabolic disturbances has not been systematic ally explored . Therefore , we conducted a systematic review to provide an overview of  non-cholesterol sterols  as markers for cholesterol metabolism in  different metabolic disorders .  Potentially relevant studies were retrieved by a systematic search of  three data bases in July 2018 and ninety-four human studies were included .   Cholesterol-st and ardized levels  of   campesterol , sitosterol  and  cholestanol   were collected to reflect cholesterol absorption and those of  lathosterol and desmosterol  to reflect cholesterol synthesis . Their use as biomarkers was examined in the following  metabolic disorders : overweight/obesity ( n = 16 ) , diabetes mellitus ( n = 15 ) , metabolic syndrome ( n = 5 ) , hyperlipidemia ( n = 11 ) , cardiovascular disease ( n = 17 ) , and diseases related to intestine ( n = 16 ) , liver ( n = 22 ) or kidney ( n = 2 ) .  In general ,  markers for cholesterol absorption and synthesis  displayed reciprocal patterns , showing that  cholesterol metabolism  is tightly regulated by the interplay of intestinal absorption and endogenous synthesis . Distinctive patterns for  cholesterol absorption or cholesterol synthesis  could be identified , suggesting that metabolic disorders can be classified as ' cholesterol absorbers or cholesterol synthesizers ' . Future studies should be performed to confirm or refute these findings and to examine whether this information can be used for targeted ( dietary ) interventions."
"sTrials of the  efficacy and safety  of  vardenafil  in the treatment of  male erectile dysfunction ( ED )  were meta-analysed . All available data bases were search ed ( January 1 , 2001–November 30 , 2003 ) .  Trials were eligible if they included men with ED , compared  vardenafil with placebo  , were r and omized , were at least of 12 weeks duration , and assessed clinical ly relevant outcomes .  Two review ers independently evaluated study quality and extracted data in a st and ardized fashion .  Nine trials ( 6809 men ) met the inclusion criteria .  In results pooled from seven fixed-dose trials ,  vardenafil  increases the  Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function question  naire by 6.18 units ( weighted mean difference ( WMD ) ) .  Vardenafil  also increases the  percentage of erections firm enough to allow vaginal penetration  ( WMD : 26 ) and the  percentage of sexual attempts  that were successful per participant ( WMD : 29.8 ) . The percentage of men agreeing with the statement that ‘ the treatment they have been taking over the past 4 weeks improved  their erections ’  , is also in favour of  vardenafil  ( relative risk ( RR ) : 3 ) . These  efficacy variables  appeared greater at higher doses , although there are no significant differences between 10 and 20 mg dose . The same results were extracted for the two flexible ‘ as needed ’ dosing trials .  Discontinuations  are greater at the vardenafil groups compared to placebo ( RR : 2.25 ) . Specific  adverse events  with  vardenafil   included flushing , dyspepsia , headache , and rhinitis .  Vardenafil was not significantly associated with  serious cardiovascular events or death .   Vardenafil  , in all treatment regimens , shows to possess superior  efficacy  to placebo in the treatment of  patients with  erectile dysfunction .   More data is needed on patients ' subgroups."

"yOBJECTIVES To establish whether  simplified adhesives ( self-etch )  are as clinical ly effective as  conventional adhesives ( etch- and -rinse )  with multiple application steps for treatment of  non-carious cervical lesions ( NCCLs ) .  NULL HYPOTHESIS there is no difference in the clinical effectiveness of the four different bonding strategies :  Three-step etch- and -rinse ; Two-step etch- and -rinse ; Two-step self-etch ; One-step self-etch  for treatment of NCCLs . SOURCES Electronic data bases were search ed including : Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , MEDLINE and EMBASE . In addition , studies were identified by h and search ing of selected journals . STUDY SELECTION R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing at least two  adhesives in non-carious cervical lesions ( NCCLs ) , with at least 18 months follow-up  were selected . The primary outcome was  loss of retention/restoration loss , with marginal adaptation and marginal discolouration as secondary outcomes  . Criteria for quality assessment included : r and om sequence generation ; allocation concealment ; blinding of outcome assessment ; and information on withdrawals .  Twenty six studies were identified that  met the inclusion criteria . In general , studies were not of sufficient quality to fully address the objectives of this review .  There is not enough evidence to support one adhesive or bonding strategy over another for treatment of NCCLs . Consequently , the null hypothesis of no difference can not be supported or rejected with the data currently available . There is a need for better st and ardisation and reporting of r and omised controlled trials investigating adhesive performance . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Studies with low overall risk of bias demonstrated good  clinical performance  for adhesives with all four bonding strategies . However , included studies showed wide variation between adhesives of the same category."
"nObjective To establish the clinical relevance of  S-carboxymethylcysteine  in the treatment of  glue ear in children  using measures approximating those saving a child from operation for grommet insertion . Data sources Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , EMBASE , PubMed , reference lists and review s were used for r and omised controlled trials comparing  S-carboxymethylcysteine with placebo .   Seven trials involving 283 children and 146 ears were found .  Review methods Studies were r and omised , double-blind comparisons of  S-carboxymethylcysteine  ( any dose and duration ) with  placebo  in  otitis media with effusion .  Quality of trial reporting and validity of methods were assessed and used in sensitivity analysis . Main outcomes were  relative benefit and number-needed-to-treat to prevent one grommet operation compared with  placebo .   Results  Successful outcomes  were obtained in 17 % of children given  placebo  ( range 5 % to 38 % in individual studies ) and in 35 % of children given  S-carboxymethylcysteine  ( range 22 to 80 % ) . For combined data ( children and ears ) the  relative benefit  was 2.0 ( 95%CI 1.4 to 2.8 ) and number-needed-to-treat 5.5 ( 95 % confidence interval 3.8 to 9.8 ) . Pooled data from trials of higher reporting quality ( 4/7 ) or method ological validity ( 3/7 ) tended to have lower  efficacy  but were not statistically different from those of lower quality or validity .  ConclusionS -carboxymethylcysteine  is effective in the treatment of  children with glue ear .  For every five or six children treated with  S-carboxymethylcysteine  over one to three months , one will not undergo surgery for grommet insertion who would have done had they been given  placebo .  The confidence in this conclusion is limited because studies included relatively few children."
" Some statistically significant and possibly clinical ly meaningful differences between  mirtazapine  and other antidepressive agents were found for the acute-phase treatment of major depression .

"PAlthough clinical guidelines advocate  exercise and activity  in the management of  non-specific low back pain ( NSLBP )  , the link between levels of physical activity and outcomes is unclear . This systematic review investigated the relationships between  free living  activity  levels   after onset of low back pain ( LBP )  and  measures of pain , and disability  in  patients with NSLBP .  Cohort and cross-sectional studies were located using OVID , CINAHL , Medline , AMED , Embase , Biomed , PubMed -National Library of Medicine , Proquest and Cochrane Data bases , and h and search es of reference lists . Studies were included if a statistical relationship was investigated between measures of   free living physical activity ( PA   ) in  subjects with LBP  and LBP outcome measures .  Twelve studies ( seven cohort and five cross-sectional ) were  included . One prospect i ve study reported a statistically significant relationship between  increased leisure time activity and improved LBP outcomes  , and one cross-sectional study found that lower levels of sporting activity were associated with  higher levels of pain and disability .  All  other studies ( n = 10 )  found no relationship  between measures of activity levels and either pain or disability .  Heterogeneity of study design s , particularly in terms of activity measurement , made comparisons between studies difficult . These data suggest that the activity  levels  of  patients with NSLBP  are neither associated with , nor predictive of ,  disability or pain levels .  Vali date d activity measurement in prospect i ve research is required to better evaluate the relationships between PA and LBP."
"d& NA ; An ever‐growing literature has aim ed to determine how  individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD )  differ from their typically  developing ( TD ) peers  on measures  of  multisensory integration  ( MSI )  and to ascertain the degree to which differences in MSI are associated with the broad range of symptoms associated with ASD . Findings , however , have been highly variable across the studies carried out to date . The present work systematic ally review s and quantitatively synthesizes the large literature on  audiovisual  MSI   in  individuals with ASD  to evaluate the cumulative evidence for ( a ) group differences between  individuals with ASD and TD  peers , ( b ) correlations between MSI and autism symptoms in individuals with ASD and ( c ) study level factors that may moderate findings ( i.e. , explain differential effects ) observed across studies . To identify eligible studies , a comprehensive search strategy was employed using the ProQuest search engine , PubMed data base , forwards  and backwards  citation search es , direct author contact , and h and ‐ search ing of select conference proceedings . A significant between‐group  difference in MSI  was evident in the literature , with  individuals with ASD  demonstrating  worse audiovisual integration  on average across studies compared to TD controls . This effect was moderated by  mean participant age  , such that between‐group differences were more pronounced in younger sample s.  The mean correlation between MSI and autism and related symptomatology  was also significant , indicating that  increased audiovisual integration  in individuals with ASD is associated with better  language /communication  abilities and /or  reduced autism symptom severity  in the extant literature . This effect was moderated by whether the stimuli were linguistic versus non‐linguistic in nature , such that correlation magnitudes tended to be significantly greater when linguistic stimuli were utilized in the measure of MSI . Limitations and future directions for primary and meta‐analytic research are discussed."
"rPurpose of review New evidence for recommendations for  vitamin D supplementation  in  healthy infants  based upon recent literature . Recent findings R and omized controlled trials published since 2009 that related to  vitamin D  doses in infancy were review ed . They do not provide any additional evidence that larger , more generous amounts of daily  vitamin D  beyond the customary recommended 400 IU daily dose , affect any significant outcome . Larger amounts may lead to  serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D concentrations  that have been reported to be potentially associated with adverse effects . Summary There are still many unanswered questions left , in particular whether or not more ‘ generous ’ amounts of  vitamin D  in infancy may improve  long-term health outcomes  such as prevention of osteoporosis , allergies , or cancer."

Systematic review of the association between physical fitness and musculoskeletal injury risk : part 3-flexibility , power , speed , balance , and agility . J Strength Cond Res 33(6 ) : 1723 - 1735 , 2019-We performed a systematic review and evaluation of the existing scientific literature on the association between flexibility , power , speed , balance , and agility , and  musculoskeletal injury ( MSK-I ) risk in military and civilian population s.  MEDLINE , EBSCO , EMBASE , and the Defense Technical Information Center were search ed for original studies published from 1970 to 2015 that examined associations between these physical fitness measures ( flexibility , power , speed , balance , and agility ) and MSK-I. Method ological quality and strength of the evidence were determined after criteria adapted from previously published systematic review s.  Twenty-seven of 4,229 citations met  our  inclusion criteria  . Primary findings indicate that there is ( a ) moderate evidence that  hamstring flexibility , as measured by performance  on  a sit- and -reach test or active  straight  leg raise test assessed with goniometry , and ankle flexibility  , assessed  with goniometry  , are associated with MSK-I risk ; ( b ) moderate evidence that  lower body power ,  as  measured  by  performance on a st and ing broad jump or vertical jump with no countermovement  , is associated with MSK-I risk ; ( c ) moderate evidence that  slow sprint speed  is associated with MSK-I risk ; ( d ) moderate evidence that  poor performance on a single-leg balance test  is associated with increased risk for ankle  sprain  ; and ( e ) insufficient evidence that  agility  is associated with MSK-I risk .  Several measures of flexibility , power , speed , and balance  are risk factors for training-related MSK-I in military and civilian athletic population s. Importantly , these findings can be useful for military , first responder , and athletic communities who are seeking evidence -based metrics for assessing or stratifying population s for risk of."
"aCONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE Taking the outcome of mortality into consideration , there is controversy about the beneficial effects of  neuraxial anesthesia  for  orthopedic surgery .  The aim of this study was to compare the  effectiveness and safety  of  neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia  for   orthopedic  surgery .  DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review at  Universidade Federal de Alagoas .  METHODS We search ed the Cochrane Central Register  of  Controlled Trials  ( Issue 10 , 2012 )  ,  PubMed ( 1966 to November 2012 )  , Lilacs  (  1982 to  November  2012  )  , SciELO , EMBASE ( 1974 to November 2012 ) and reference lists of the studies included . Only r and omized controlled trials were included . RESULTS Out  of 5,032 titles and abstract s , 17 studies were included .  There were no statistically significant differences in  mortality  ( risk difference , RD : -0.01 ; 95 % confidence interval , CI : -0.04 to 0.01 ; n = 1903 ) ,  stroke  ( RD : 0.02 ; 95 % CI : -0.04 to 0.08 ; n = 259 ) ,  myocardial infa rct ion  ( RD : -0.01 ; 95 % CI : -0.04 to 0.02 ; n = 291 ) ,  length of hospitalization  ( mean difference , -0.05 ; 95 % CI : -0.69 to 0.58 ; n = 870 ) ,  postoperative cognitive dysfunction  ( RD : 0.00 ; 95 % CI : -0.04 to 0.05 ; n = 479 ) or  pneumonia  ( odds ratio , 0.61 ; 95 % CI : 0.25 to 1.49 ; n = 167 ) .  So far , the evidence available from the studies included is insufficient to prove that  neuraxial anesthesia  is more  effective and  safer than  general  anesthesia for orthopedic surgery . However , this systematic review does not rule out clinical ly important differences with regard to mortality , stroke , myocardial infa rct ion , length of hospitalization , postoperative cognitive dysfunction or pneumonia."
"nThis systematic review synthesizes evidence on the impact of  conditional and unconditional cash transfers ( CCT and UCT )  on contraception in  low- and middle-income countries .  Scientific and gray literature data bases were search ed from 1994 to 2016 and  11 papers from ten studies were included  . Most of the studies had low risk of bias .  Cash transfers  were used for increasing school attendance or improving health and nutrition , but not directly for contraception . Three studies showed positive impact on  contraceptive use  and four showed a  decrease in fertility outcomes .  An  increase in childbearing  was observed in two studies , and three studies demonstrated  no  impact  on fertility indicators .  All studies treated  contraceptive use or fertility  only as unintended and indirect outcomes . The available evidence on impact of  CCT and UCT  on contraception is inconclusive due to the limited number of studies , varying outcome measures , and lack of intervention specifically for contraception."
"tThe positive relationship between per capita availability of  dairy products  and average   height   found in historical studies ( for instance in nineteenth century Bavaria , Prussia and France ; Baten , 2009 ) does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship . Historical studies usually apply non-experimental methods that may produce substantial bias . Modern experimental controlled studies may provide high quality evidence supporting a causal relationship between consumption of dairy products and physical  growth  . This paper provides a systematic review and meta- analysis of controlled trials investigating the effect of  supplementing usual diet with dairy products  on physical growth .  Twelve studies provided sufficient , independent data for meta- analysis . Seven studies were conducted since the 1990s . The other studies were conducted between 1926 and 1980 . Studies  were conducted  in Europe , USA , China , Northern Vietnam , Kenya , Indonesia and India .  Many studies had some internal validity problems such as lack of r and omisation or dissimilarity of groups at baseline regarding height and age , which affects the quality of evidence . Meta- analysis and sensitivity analysis showed that the most likely effect of  dairy products  supplementation is 0.4 cm  per annum additional growth  per ca 245 ml of milk daily . Meta-regression analysis indicated that milk might have more  effect on growth  than other dairy products while lower height-for-age and being a  teenager  increased the effect of supplementation . In conclusion , there is moderate quality evidence that  dairy products supplementation   stimulate linear growth  supporting hypotheses that changing levels of consumption of dairy products in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed to trends in height."

METHODS AND RESULTS We search ed MEDLINE , Embase , and Web of Science from inception to March 2019 , limited to human subjects and English language . We also search ed for unpublished data . We limited studies to  r and omized controlled trials that enrolled adult patients with AF ≤ 48 h and compared  antidysrhythmic agents , placebo , or control .   We determined these outcomes prior to data extraction  : ( i ) rate of conversion to sinus rhythm within 24 h , ( ii ) time to cardioversion to sinus rhythm , ( iii ) rate of significant adverse events , and ( iv ) rate of thromboembolism  within 30 days . We extracted data according to PRISMA -NMA and appraised selected trials using the Cochrane review h and book . The  systematic review initially identified 640 studies ; 30 met inclusion criteria . Twenty-one trials that r and omized 2785 patients  provided  efficacy  data for the conversion rate outcome . Bayesian network meta- analysis using a r and om-effects model demonstrated that  ranolazine + amiodarone  intravenous ( IV ) [ odds ratio ( OR ) 39.8 , 95 % credible interval ( CrI ) 8.3 - 203.1 ] , vernakalant ( OR 22.9 , 95 % CrI 3.7 - 146.3 ) ,  flecainide  ( OR 16.9 , 95 % CrI 4.1 - 73.3 ) ,  amiodarone  oral ( OR 10.2 , 95 % CrI 3.1 - 36.0 ) ,  ibutilide  ( OR 7.9 , 95 % CrI 1.2 - 52.5 ) ,  amiodarone  IV ( OR 5.4 , 95 % CrI 2.1 - 14.6 ) , and  propafenone  ( OR 4.1 , 95 % CrI 1.7 - 10.5 ) were associated with significantly  increased likelihood of conversion  within 24 h when compared to placebo/control .  Overall  quality was low , and the network exhibited inconsistency . Probabilistic analysis ranked vernakalant and flecainide high and propafenone and  amiodarone  IV low .  For pharmacologic cardioversion of recent-onset AF within 24 h , there is insufficient evidence to determine which treatment is superior . Vernakalant and flecainide may be relatively more efficacious agents . Propafenone and IV  amiodarone  may be relatively less efficacious . Further high-  quality  study is necessary."
"hBackground and Aims  Probiotics  was considered as a potential therapy for  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD )  without approval and comprehensive assessment in recent years , which call for a meta- analysis . Methods We performed electronic and manual search es including  English and Chinese data bases published before April 2019 , with the use of mesh term and free text of "" nonalcoholic fatty liver disease "" and ""  probiotics . ""   Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of   probiotic therapy  in NAFLD patients  were included according to the eligibility criteria . With the use of r and om effects models , clinical outcomes were presented as weighted mean difference ( WMD ) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , while heterogeneity and meta-regression were also assessed . Results  28 clinical trials enrolling 1555 criterion proven NAFLD patients with the use of probiotics from 4 to 28 weeks were included .  Overall ,  probiotic therapy  had beneficial effects on  body mass index  ( WMD : -1.46 , 95 % CI : [ -2.44 , -0.48 ] ) ,  alanine aminotransferase  ( WMD : -13.40 , 95 % CI : [ -17.03 , -9.77 ] ) ,  aspartate transaminase  ( WMD : -13.54 , 95 % CI : [ -17.86 , -9.22 ] ) ,  gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase  ( WMD : -9.88 , 95 % CI : [ -17.77 , -1.99 ] ) ,  insulin  ( WMD : -1.32 , 95 % CI : [ -2.43 , -0.21 ] ) ,  homeostasis model assessment -insulin resistance  ( WMD : -0.42 , 95 % CI : [ -0.73 , -0.12 ] ) , and  total cholesterol  ( WMD : -15.38 , 95 % CI : [ -26.50 , -4.25 ] ) , but not in  fasting blood sugar , lipid profiles , or tumor necrosis factor-alpha .  Conclusion The systematic review and meta- analysis support that  probiotics  are superior to placebo  in NAFLD patients  and could be utilized as a common complementary therapeutic approach."
"sThe aim of this study is to gather evidence of head-to-head double-blind r and omized-controlled trials on the  efficacy and safety  of available treatments for  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) in children and adolescents .  A systematic review was conducted by two independent review ers in ten electronic data bases ( PROSPERO register CRD42016043239 ) . Method ological quality of included studies was evaluated according to the Jadad scale . Network meta-analyses were performed including double-blinded head-to-head trials comparing active allopathic drugs in  patients ( 0–18 years old ) diagnosed with ADHD .  The  results  of  efficacy and safety  of  atomoxetine ( ATX ) , bupropion , buspirone ( BSP ) , dexamphetamine , edivoxetine ( EDX ) , guanfacine ( GXR ) , lisdexamfetamine ( LDX ) , methylpheni date ( MPH ) , mixed amphetamine salts , modafinil , pindolol ( PDL ) , reboxetine ( RBX ) , selegiline , and venlafaxine  were analyzed using ADDIS software v.1.16.5 .  Forty-eight trials were identified ( n = 4169 participants )  ,  of which 12 were used for efficacy analysis and 33 for safety analysis .  On the  CGI-I scale  , the analysis revealed that MPH was more effective than ATX and GXR . For the  safety outcomes  , according to drug ranks , LDX was more likely to  cause sleep disorders  ( 39 % ) as well as  loss of appetite  ( 65 % ) and  behavior problems such as irritability  ( 60 % ) . BSP ( 71 % ) and EDX ( 44 % )  caused less appetite decrease .  For  behavioral effects  , PDL was considered safest ( 50 % ) . For any  adverse events  , RBX ( 89 % ) was the safest alternative . The lack of head-to-head trials properly reporting outcomes of interest limited some comparisons . Network meta- analysis offered a broader overview on the available treatments for ADHD , especially for safety issues , and contributes towards evidence gathering and clinical practice decisions . A core outcome set for ADHD should be design ed to guide the conduction and report of clinical trials."

"yBackground . Most  adults  choose  walking  as a leisure activity . However , many do not reach the international physical activity guidelines for adults , which recommend moderate intensity  aerobic activity  for at least 150 minutes/week in bouts of 10 minutes . Purpose . This systematic review provides an up date on the  walking cadence  required to reach moderate  intensity in adults and older adults  , identifies variables associated with reaching moderate intensity , and evaluates how walking cadence intensity should be measured , but the main purpose is to report the interventions that have been attempted to prescribe walking cadence to increase  time spent  at moderate intensity or other outcomes for  adults and older adults .  Methods . SportD ISCUS , Scopus , and PubMed data bases were search ed . We identified  3,917 articles and 31 were retained for this systematic review . Only articles written in English were  included . Results . In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but  older adults  may require a higher  cadence .  Currently , few studies have explored using  walking cadence  prescription as an intervention to increase  physical activity levels .  Conclusion .  Prescribing walking cadence  as a way to increase  physical activity levels  has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase  physical activity levels  at moderate intensity."
" Some possibly clinical ly meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist , but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings . In terms of response , there was a moderate quality of evidence that  citalopram  was better than  paroxetine  in the acute phase ( six to 12 weeks ) , although only one study contributed data . In terms of  early response  to treatment ( one to four weeks ) there was moderate quality of evidence that  mirtazapine  was better than  paroxetine  and that  paroxetine  was better than  reboxetine .  However there was no clear evidence that  paroxetine  was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point . Even if some differences were identified , the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials . Finally , most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias , and were sponsored by the drug industry . The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind."
" :  Vitamin D  may play a role in  type 2 diabetes ;  however , to better define the role of  vitamin D  in the development and progression of type  2  diabetes , high- quality observational studies and RCTs that measure  blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration  and clinical ly relevant glycemic outcomes are needed."
"yThe aim of the present systematic review was to synthesize data from r and omized controlled trials investigating the effects of  olive oil  on  markers  of  inflammation or endothelial function .  Literature search in electronic data bases Cochrane Trial Register , EMBASE , and MEDLINE was performed .  Thirty studies enrolling 3106 participants fulfilled the selection criteria .  Pooled effects of different interventions were assessed as mean difference using a r and om effects model .  Olive oil interventions  ( with daily consumption ranging approximately between 1 mg and 50 mg ) result ed in a significantly more pronounced decrease in  C-reactive protein  ( mean difference : -0.64 mg/L , ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -0.96 to -0.31 ) , p < 0.0001 , n = 15 trials ) and  interleukin-6  ( mean difference : -0.29 ( 95 % CI -0.7 to -0.02 ) , p < 0.04 , n = 7 trials ) as compared to controls , respectively .  Values of flow-mediated dilatation  ( given as absolute percentage ) were significantly more increased in individuals subjected to  olive oil interventions  ( mean difference : 0.76 % ( 95 % CI 0.27 to 1.24 ) , p < 0.002 , n = 8 trials ) . These results provide evidence that  olive oil  might exert beneficial effects  on endothelial function as well as markers of inflammation and endothelial function  , thus representing a key ingredient contributing to the cardiovascular-protective effects of a Mediterranean diet . However , due to the heterogeneous study design s ( e.g. ,  olive oil  given as a supplement or as part of dietary pattern , variations in control diets ) , a conservative interpretation of the results is necessary."
"nThe scientific evidence on the causes for  sick leave attributed to back and neck disorders  was review ed . Categories were established for acute , recurring , and chronic problems based on the duration of the sick leave period .  Forty-eight articles were found  to be  relevant  , whereof two were  of high  quality and 26 were  of medium or low quality .  Quality was assessed exclusively in relation to the aim of this systematic review . The results reveal limited published research on causes for  sick  leave from back and neck disorders . The generalisability of the findings is also limited since  most of the subjects were men and employees in manufacturing industries . Women , white-collar workers  ,  employees in the public sector ( care , social services , schools  , etc  )  were underrepresented in the studies . Hence , these groups and areas should be studied further to verify conclusions and enhance knowledge about the causes for sick leave from back and neck disorders . The following factors were found to have consistent , but limited , support as regards their influence on the risk for sick leave due to back and neck disorders : ( a ) heavy physical workload , bent or twisted working position , and low work satisfaction increases the risk for  short-term  and  long-term sick  leave  ;  ( b ) specific back diagnoses and previous sick leave due to back disorders increases the risk for  short-term  and  long-term sick  leave  ;  ( c ) female gender , smoking , exposure to vibration , and deficient social support were not found to significantly increase the risk for  short-term and long-term sick leave ;  ( d ) self-reported  pain and functional impairments  were associated with a high risk for  long-term sick leave ;  ( e ) longer employment periods reduced the risk for short-term sick leave ; ( f ) perceived dem and s at work did not influence short-term sick leave ; ( g ) female gender and higher age increases the risk for disability pension."

"CBACKGROUND  Opioid substitution treatment ( OST )  can increase  quality of life ( WHOQOL-BREF )  and reduce  addiction severity index  (  ASI )  scores among participants over time .   OST  program participants  have noted that improvement in  quality of life  is one of the most important variables to their reduction in drug use . However , there is little systematic underst and ing of WHOQOL-BREF and ASI domain changes among  OST participants in low and middle-income countries ( LMIC ) .  METHODS Utilizing PRISMA guidelines we conducted a systematic literature search to identify  OST  program   studies documenting changes in WHOQOL-BREF or ASI domains for  participants in  buprenorphine  or  methadone  programs in LMIC .  St and ardized mean differences for baseline and follow-up domain scores were compared along with relationships between domain scores , OST dosage , and length of follow-up . RESULTS There were  13  OST program  studies with 1801 participants from five countries eligible for inclusion in the review .  Overall , statistically significant changes were noted in all four  WHOQOL-BREF domain  and four of the  seven ASI domain scores ( drug , psychological , legal , and family )  documented in studies . Dosage of pharmacologic medication and length of follow-up did not affect changes in domain scores .  WHOQOL-BREF and ASI domain scoring is a useful tool in measuring overall  quality of life  and levels  of addiction  among  OST participants  . Coupled with measurements of  blood-borne infection , drug use , relapse , and overdose  , WHOQOL-BREF and ASI represent equally important tools for evaluating the effects of  OST  over time and should be further developed as integrated tools in the evaluation of  participants  in LMIC."

" The current evidence is not sufficiently strong to verify a  preventive role  of probiotics in AR , but probiotics  may improve the overall quality of life and nasal symptom scores  . Because the available data were generated from only a few trials with a high degree of heterogeneity , routine use of probiotics for prevention and treatment in  patients with AR  can not be recommended."
" Evidence for  measurement properties of the  6MWT   varies largely among chronic pediatric conditions . Further research is needed in all patient groups to explore the ability of the  6MWT  to measure significant and clinical ly important changes .

"aObjective To perform a systematic review of the published literature to evaluate how functional capacity , as measured by the  University of California at San Diego  (  UCSD ) Performance-based Skills Assessment ( UPSA )  , relates to other functional measures and real-world outcomes among  individuals with schizophrenia .  Methods The MEDLINE ® and Embase ® data bases were search ed to identify joint evaluations with  UPSA  and key functional outcomes  ( functional scale measures ; generic or disease-specific , health-related quality of life [ HRQoL ] ; or real-world outcomes [ residential status ; employment status ] )  in  patients with schizophrenia .  Pearson correlations were estimated between  UPSA scores , HRQoL , other functional scale measures , and real-world outcomes  , for outcomes described in at least six studies . Results The synthesis included  76 studies  that provided 73 unique data sets . Quantitative assessment between  the Specific Level of Function ( SLOF )  ( n=18 ) scores  and UPSA scores  demonstrated a moderate borderline-significant correlation ( 0.45 , p=0.06 ) . Quantitative analysis of the relationship between  the Global Assessment of Functioning ( GAF )  ( n=11 )  and the Multidimensional Scale of Independent Functioning ( MSIF )  ( n=6 ) scales revealed moderate and small nonsignificant Pearson correlations of -0.34 ( p=0.31 ) and 0.12 ( p=0.83 ) , respectively . There was a small borderline-significant correlation  between UPSA  score and residential status ( n=36 ; 0.31 ; p=0.08 ) , while no correlation was found  between UPSA score and employment  status ( n=19 ; 0.04 ; p=0.88 ) . Conclusion  The  SLOF was the most often used functional measure and had the strongest observed correlation with the UPSA . Although knowledge gaps remain , evidence from this review indicates that there is a quantitative relationship between functional capacity and real-world outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia."

"tA systematic review and meta- analysis identified  42 r and omised control trials  comparing a   nurse-led  intervention with ' usual care '  to quantify their effect on glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and major cardiovascular risk factors in  diabetes patients .  All relevant data bases were systematic ally search ed for publications to February 2016 : MEDLINE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , EMBASE and Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) . The 42 trials  recruited 9955 diabetes patients ( 5022 r and omised to intervention and 4933 to  '  usual care ' )  . For  patients  receiving the   nurse-led  intervention  , compared with  ' usual care '  , there were small but significant  mean reductions for HbA1c  [ -0.28 % ; 95 % CI -0.38 % , -0.18 % ; p-value<0.0001 , n=6920 ]  and serum triglyceride levels  [ -0.27mmol/L ; 95 % CI -0.49 , -0.06 ; p=0.01 , n=1169 ] , and a greater proportion of patients  stopped smoking  [ risk ratio=2.70 ; 95 % CI 1.35 , 5.43 ; p=0.005 , n=1890 patients ] .

"dThe purpose of this research was to up date the series of articles on  evidence  -based  treatment  for  children and adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder  that have appeared in this journal ( Evans , Owens & Bunford , 2014 ; Pelham & Fabiano , 2008 ; Pelham , Wheeler , & Chronis , 1998 ) . We completed a systematic review of the literature published between  2012  and  2016  to establish levels of evidence for psychosocial treatments for these youth . We identified articles using  criteria  established by the Society of Clinical Child  and Adolescent  Psychology using keyword search es of abstract s and titles . Articles were classified according to a modified version of the Division 12 task force guidelines that was used in other review s in this series . The results revealed that findings are becoming increasingly nuanced with variations in levels of evidence related to ages of the children and characteristics of the specific treatment . In addition , we focused our critique on generalization of treatment effects across setting s and time and on sample diversity ( with regard to ethnicity and  levels  of  parent education  ) in relation to the population .  Children of parents with  higher levels of education  than average  appear to be overrepresented in the literature . Implication s for future treatment development and evaluation and for dissemination research are discussed."
"-In an early view issue of this journal , Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) published a systematic review and meta- analysis about the mutual relationship between obesity and intelligence quotient ( IQ ) . The authors observed that  a lower IQ score in childhood  was associated with obesity in later adulthood . Although it is not possible to definitively rule out reverse causation in the IQ – obesity relationship , two main mechanisms have been put forward by the authors that could explain why a low IQ has been found to be a predictor of obesity . First , higher intelligence may reduce the risk of obesity by promoting more healthful behaviours . For example , data from a cohort study showed that  children with higher mental ability scores  reported significantly more frequent consumption of  fruit and vegetables  and more  high-intensity physical activity  participation in adulthood ( 2 ) . Second , higher childhood IQ may predict favourable socioeconomic positions later in life . The authors even suggested in this case increasing educational levels as a means of reducing obesity . Beyond this interpretation , our physiological vision and experience in the field leads us to extend and /or propose another explanation . Recent data from our research group support the relevance of considering  mental work  and its related cognitive effort as a potential mediator of the relationship . Indeed , we have recently reported results from two experimental studies showing that mental work up-regulates  appetite-stimulating hormones  and promotes  overconsumption of food  ( 3,4 ) . Furthermore , a careful examination of our data revealed that when the subjects were categorized on the basis of the  mental workload intensity  , those for whom the intensity of the mental effort was greater significantly increased their  spontaneous food intake  as compared with those characterized by a less strenuous cognitive effort . In other words , the harder we think the more we eat . This  hyperphagic  effect of intense thinking was also accompanied by more  plasma glucose instabilities  ( 5 ) . The  fluctuations in plasma glucose levels  that were observed are in agreement with the literature showing that a period of intense cognitive processing leads to a measurable decrease in  levels of blood glucose  ( 6 ) , a fall that has also been associated with feeling  less energetic  ( 7 ) . Accordingly ,  food intake  might be perceived as a strategy for allowing the individual to recover  optimal body functioning .  These observations are also relevant for  students having hard times to learn at school and  for  whom study  ing is arduous and mentally challenging . On the basis of our observations , we find it realistic to postulate that those susceptible to commit more cognitive effort to take in charge st and ard mental tasks are more likely to  over-eat and gain weight  compared with those for whom the accomplishment of mental tasks at the same level of  performance  is elementary or more natural . Along the same lines , it would not be surprising to find a higher  dropout rate  for those ‘  mentally stressed ’ students  . In a system where academic performance continues to rank as high priority in public schools , it seems obvious that some students are genetically more gifted and likely to perform at a higher level ( 8) . As previously shown , better cognitive abilities are predictive of more important life achievements such as  earning a doctorate , securing a patent , or publishing a novel or major literary work  ( 9 ) . It may be somewhat paradoxical that the amount of  knowledge-based work  is more important in the higher socioeconomic groups whereas population data show a higher prevalence of obesity for the socioeconomically disadvantaged . However , we need to look at the obesity epidemic in a broader context if we want to underst and its aetiology . Obesity is a very complex condition with numerous determinants interacting together and showing large inter-individual variations . Thus , individuals highly involved in mental work are not all likely to over-eat and other healthy behaviours such as regular physical activity may counterbalance the net impact on energy balance . With the advent of  computers and new technologies  , the pendulum has swung far in the direction of excessive mental activities , as opposed to excessive physical activities . A careful examination of  computer-related activities  reveals that they represent a particular type of sedentary activities ; they are stressful and biologically dem and ing for the body and deserve to be counterbalanced by an adequate physical activity regimen ( 10 ) . The low  IQ  – obesity relationship is a timely and meaningful research topic in a context of economic competitiveness and globalization . As mentioned in the paper by Yu and co-workers ( 1 ) ,  educational attainment  seems to be an important mediator of this relationship . However , the orexigenic effects of thinking too hard must be further obesity review s doi : 10.1111/j.1467 -."
"yParental  iron  is used to optimize hemoglobin and enhance erythropoiesis in end-stage  renal  disease along with erythropoietin-stimulating agents . Safety of  iron  has been debated extensively and there is no definite evidence whether  parenteral iron  increases the risk of  infections  and  mortality .  We performed this meta- analysis to evaluate the incidence of  infectious complications  ,  hospitalizations  and  mortality  with use of  parenteral iron .  Medical electronic data bases [ PubMed , EMBASE , Scopus , Web of Science , and cochrane central register for controlled clinical trials ( CENTRAL ) ] were queried for studies that investigated the  association between  intravenous iron  administration and infection in hemodialysis patients . 24 studies ( 8 R and omized control trials ( RCTs ) and 16 observational studies ) were considered  for  qualitative and  quantitative  analysis  .  All-cause mortality  Data from 6 RCTs show that high-dose IV  iron  conferred 17 % less all-cause  mortality  compared to controls ; however , this outcome was not statistically significant ( OR = 0.83 , CI [ 0.7 , 1.01 ] , p = 0.07 ) .  Nine observational studies  were pooled under the r and om effects model due to significant heterogeneity ( I2 = 83 % , p < 0.001 ) . The overall HR showed  increased risk of all-cause mortality  in the high-dose group but was statistically non-significant ( HR = 1.1 , CI [ 1 , 1.22 ] , p = 0.06 ) . Infections Four RCTs with no heterogeneity among their data ( I2 = 0 % , p = 0.61 ) . Under the fixed effect model , there was no difference in  the infection rate  between high-dose iron and control group ( OR = 0.97 , CI [ 0.82 , 1.16 ] , p = 0.77 ) ; eight observational studies with significant heterogeneity and utilizing r and om effects model . Summary HR showed increased yet  non-significant risk of infection  in the high-dose group ( HR = 1.13 , CI [ 0.99 , 1.28 ] , p = 0.07 ) Hospitalization 1 RCT and six observational studies provided data for  the rate of all-cause hospitalization .  There was marked heterogeneity among observational studies . RCT showed no significant difference between high-dose iron and controls in the  rate of hospitalization  ( OR = 1.03 , CI [ 0.87 , 1.23 ] , p = 0.71 ) . Summary HR for observational data showed  increased rate of hospitalization  in the high-dose group ; however , this effect was not statistically significant ( HR = 1.11 , CI [ 0.99 , 1.24 ] , p = 0.07 ) .  Cardiovascular events  One RCT compared the  rate of adverse cardiovascular events  between  high-dose and low-dose iron .  No significant difference was observed between the two groups ( 22.3 % vs 25.6 % , p = 0.12 ) . Six heterogeneous observational studies ( I2 = 65 % , p < 0.001 ) reported on  the rate of cardiovascular events  . No significant difference was observed between high-dose iron and controls ( HR = 1.18 , CI [ 0.89 , 1.57 ] , p = 0.24 ) . High-dose  parenteral iron  does not seem to be associated with  higher risk of infection , all-cause mortality , increased hospitalization or increased cardiovascular events  on analysis of RCTs . Observational studies show  increased risk for all-cause mortality , infections and hospitalizations  that were not statistically significant and were associated with significant heterogeneity."
 trials to date suggest potential for improving persistence with medication taking thus  improving treatment  outcomes and  reducing fracture risk .

"sIntroduction The purpose of this systematic literature review is to review published studies on  foot care knowledge and foot care practice interventions  as part of  diabetic foot care self-management interventions  . Methods Medline , CINAHL , CENTRAL , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials data bases were search ed . References from the included studies were review ed to identify any missing studies that could be included . Only   foot care knowledge and  foot care practice intervention  studies that focused on the  person living with type 2 diabetes  were included in this review . Author , study design , sample , intervention , and results were extracted . Results  Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria  and were classified according to r and omized controlled trial ( n=9 ) , survey design ( n=13 ) , cohort studies ( n=4 ) , cross-sectional studies ( n=2 ) , qualitative studies ( n=2 ) , and case series ( n=1 ) . Improving  lower extremity complications  associated with type 2 diabetes can be done through  effective foot care interventions  that  include foot care knowledge and foot care practice s.  Conclusion Preventing these complications , underst and ing the risk factors , and having the ability to manage complications outside of the clinical encounter is an important part of a diabetes foot self-care management program . Interventions and research studies that aim to reduce  lower extremity complications  are still lacking . Further research is needed to test foot  care  interventions across multiple population s and geographic locations."
" Compared with  placebo , single drug active component  , or  usual care  , the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on  all-cause mortality  or  CVD events  are uncertain ; only few trials report these outcomes and the included trials were primarily design ed to observe changes in CVD risk factor levels rather than clinical events . Reductions in  blood pressure and lipid parameters  are generally lower than those previously projected , though substantial heterogeneity of results exists . Fixed-dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in  adverse events  compared with  placebo , single drug active component  , or  usual care  but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen . Ongoing trials of fixed-dose combination therapy will likely inform key outcomes."

The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials , addressing the efficacy of  oral propranolol versus placebo  or  other  medication as a treatment for alleviating either state or trait anxiety in  patients suffering from anxiety disorders . Eight studies met the inclusion criteria .  These studies concerned  panic disorder with or without agoraphobia ( four studies , total n = 130 ) , specific phobia ( two studies , total n = 37 ) , social phobia ( one study , n = 16 ) , and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) ( one study , n = 19 ) .  Three out of four panic disorder trials qualified for pooled analyses . These meta-analyses found  no statistically significant differences  between the  efficacy  of propranolol and benzodiazepines regarding the short-term treatment of  panic disorder  with or without  agoraphobia .  Also , no evidence was found for  effects  of propranolol on  PTSD symptom severity through inhibition of memory reconsolidation .  In conclusion , the quality of evidence for the  efficacy  of  propranolol  at present is insufficient to support the routine use of  propranolol  in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders."
"tAtrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia in  adults  , accounting for about one third of hospitalizations for arrhythmia ( 1 ) . The prevalence increases from less than 1 % in  persons younger than 60 years of age  to more than 8 % in those  older than 80 years of age  ( 2 - 6 ) . The incidence ranges from 0.2 % per year for  men 30 to 39 years of age  to 2.3 % per year in  men 80 to 89 years of age  ( 7 , 8) . The age-adjusted incidence for women is about half that of men ( 9 ) . The cardiac conditions most commonly associated with atrial fibrillation are rheumatic mitral valve disease , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , and hypertension ( 8 , 10 ) . Noncardiac causes include hyperthyroidism , hypoxic conditions , surgery , and alcohol intoxication . A predisposing condition exists in more than 90 % of cases ( 5 , 11 , 12 ) ; the remaining cases have what is called lone atrial fibrillation .  Patients with atrial fibrillation  frequently have  symptoms of hemodynamic compromise  , ranging from  irregular palpitations  to the more  insidious feeling of malaise .  They also have an increased  risk for thromboembolism .  Comparing with age-matched controls , the  relative risk for stroke  is increased 2- to 7-fold in  patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation  ( 3 , 8 , 13 ) , and the absolute  risk  for  stroke  is between 1 % and 5 % per year , depending on clinical characteristics ( 3 , 12 , 14 - 16 ) .  Quality of life  is an important consideration for  patients .  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation disrupts the  lives  of patients ( 17 ) , but this perception may not be associated with frequency or duration of symptoms .  Warfarin therapy  affects  quality of life  because of frequent blood testing and recommendations for limiting some activities . Gage and colleagues ( 18 ) found that atrial fibrillation  decreases utility , a quantitative assessment of quality of life  used in decision analysis , by 1.3 % . Protheroe and associates ( 19 ) found that only 61 % of patients would prefer  anticoagulation  to  no treatment  , considerably fewer than those for whom guidelines would recommend treatment . Little is known about the direct effects of  antiarrhythmic therapy  and  rate-control therapy  on  quality of life .  The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology Task Force on Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation classified atrial fibrillation into 4 types ( 20 ) : first detected episode , paroxysmal ( terminates spontaneously ) , persistent ( electrical or pharmacologic termination necessary ) , and permanent ( resistant to electrical or pharmacologic conversion or accepted by the physician ) . The purpose of this review was to summarize the evidence that was available during formulation of the guidelines developed by the American College of Physicians ( ACP ) and the American Academy of Family Physicians ( AAFP ) for management of  adult patients with nonpostoperative atrial fibrillation .  The foundation of this background paper was a systematic review of the  pharmacologic management  of atrial fibrillation that examined the efficacy of medications used for stroke prevention , ventricular  rate control  , acute  conversion  , and  maintenance  of  sinus rhythm  , as well as the role of echocardiography in guiding pharmacologic therapy ( 21 ) . For this up date d version of the systematic review , we considered observational data , consensus statements , decision analyses , and relevant guidelines . This review focused on the evaluation and pharmacologic management of  adult patients with nonpostoperative atrial fibrillation .  The rapidly advancing field of nonpharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation is outside the scope of this paper . Methods A full description of the methods used in the systematic review can be found in a detailed evidence report ( 21 ) . A brief description of these methods and additional methods specific to this article are given below . Literature Identification Whenever possible , we focused our search es for relevant evidence on the strongest study design : r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) . For our previous systematic review , we identified controlled trials in the CENTRAL data base produced by the Cochrane Collaboration 's international efforts , search ed MEDLINE from 1966 to 1998 for citations tagged as r and omized , controlled trial or controlled clinical trial , search ed the PubMed Related Articles feature , review ed h and search es su bmi tted to the Baltimore Cochrane Center , scanned the reference lists in relevant publications , and scanned the table of contents of relevant journals . For the current review , we also search ed MEDLINE from May 1998 through September 2001 ( using the same search terms as in the original review plus terms to identify meta-analyses and decision analyses ) . For topics without sufficient RCTs , we used  observational data , consensus statements , review articles , and decision analyses  obtained from our search of MEDLINE from 1966 through September 2001 . Although we had to use September 2001 as a cutoff for the systematic search ing of the literature in order to generate a report for the ACPAAFP Guideline group , we included selected studies published after September 2001 on the basis of input from the group . Article Review Process Studies were eligible for review if they were r and omized trials  of adult patients  that addressed the management of nonpostoperative atrial fibrillation . In the previous systematic review ,  521 citations were identified and 179 articles  were eligible for detailed review . The up date d search yielded  29 additional articles that met  our inclusion criteria . Statistical Analysis For the quantitative analysis , we stratified the data to obtain an effect measure for each drug . We used Stata , version 7.0 ( Stata Corp. , College Station , Texas ) to calculate the  odds ratio ( OR )  of success of the drug compared with  placebo .  Respective 95 % CIs and P values were also calculated . We used ORs because they provide less heterogeneity of study results than relative risk ratio . Estimates of the relative  rates  of the outcomes of interest were pooled by using st and ard methods for combining the OR for the outcomes of  conversion to sinus rhythm , maintenance of sinus rhythm , stroke , peripheral embolism , major bleeding , minor bleeding , and death  ( 21 ) . Studies were weighted on the basis of the precision of the estimate within each study . When no heterogeneity was found , meta-analyses used the fixed-effects model ( MantelHaenszel method for pooling ) ( 22 ) . When heterogeneity was found , the r and om-effects model was used ( DerSimonian and Laird method of pooling ) ( 23 ) . An  OR  was considered significantly different from 1 if the P value was less than 0.05 . Statistical strength of evidence was categorized as strong ( P 0.01 ) , moderate ( 0.01 < P 0.05 ) , suggestive ( 0.05 < P 0.2 ) , or inconclusive ( P > 0.2 ) . Role of the Funding Sources The initial systematic review was funded through a contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( 21 ) . Subsequent work was supported by the American College of Physicians . Drafts of the manuscript were review ed by members of the ACP/AAFP guidelines committee for management of atrial fibrillation . Data Synthesis Does Aggressive Rhythm Control Improve  Mortality and Morbidity  Compared with Rate Control ? Although the relative benefits and risks of rate versus rhythm control are of paramount importance in the management of atrial fibrillation , studies directly addressed this issue only recently . By far the largest , the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management ( AFFIRM ) trial was a  multicenter  RCT that  enrolled 4060 patients from more than 200 sites in Canada and the United States  ( 24 )  . Eligibility criteria included documented atrial fibrillation lasting at least 6 hours and at least 1 risk factor for stroke ( age > 65 years , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , previous stroke , and poor ventricular function ) . Average age was 70 years . Sixty-one percent of patients were men , 89 % were white , 71 % had  hypertension  , 38 % had coronary artery disease , and 18 % had had failure of antiarrhythmic therapy .  After patients were r and omly assigned to the  rhythm-control  or  rate-control  group , physicians could choose from a list of  pharmacologic  and  nonpharmacologic therapies .  Although anticoagulation was continued indefinitely for the rate-control group , discontinuation of  anticoagulation  was permitted at 1 month or later following conversion in the rhythm-control arm . The  mortality rate  at 5 years was 23.8 % in the rhythm-control group and 21.3 % in the rate-control group ( hazard ratio , 1.15 [ 95 % CI , 0.99 to 1.34 ] ; P = 0.08 ) .  Combined central nervous system ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic events  occurred in 8.9 % of patients in the rhythm-control group and 7.4 % of patients in the rate-control group ( P > 0.2 ) . Eighty-five patients in the rhythm-control group and 79 in the rate-control group had  strokes  ( P > 0.2 ) . Of note , more than 70 % of the  strokes  in both groups occurred in patients who had stopped taking anticoagulant therapy or who had an international normalized ratio less than 2.0 . Preliminary analyses of other secondary end points , including  quality of life and functional capacity  , did not show statistical difference between treatment groups . However , more  hospitalizations  occurred in the rhythm-control group . A smaller study conducted in the Netherl and s , the RAte Control versus Electrical cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation ( RACE ) study ( 25 ) , r and omly assigned  522 patients  to aggressive rhythm control or rate control only .  Mean age was 68 years . Sixty-four percent were men , 49 % had hypertension , and 27 % had coronary artery disease .  The primary composite end point of  cardiovascular mortality , heart failure , thromboembolic complications , bleeding , pacemaker implantation , and severe side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs  occurred in 17.2 % of patients in the rate-control group and in 22.6 % of patients in the rhythm-control group over a mean of 2.3 years . Thus , rate control was not."
"sPURPOSE To up date the 1999 American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline for antiemetics in oncology . UP DATE METHODOLOGY The Up date Committee completed a review and analysis of data published from 1998 thru February 2006 . The literature review focused on published r and omized controlled trials , and systematic review s and meta-analyses of published phase II and phase III r and omized controlled trials . RECOMMENDATIONS The three-drug combination of a  5-hydroxytryptamine-3 ( 5-HT(3 ) ) serotonin receptor antagonist , dexamethasone , and aprepitant  is recommended before chemotherapy of high emetic risk . For  persons receiving chemotherapy of high emetic risk  , there is no group of patients for whom agents of lower therapeutic index are appropriate first-choice antiemetics . These agents should be reserved for patients intolerant of or refractory to 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists , neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists , and dexamethasone . The three-drug combination of a  5-HT3 receptor serotonin antagonist , dexamethasone , and aprepitant  is recommended for patients receiving an  anthracycline and cyclophosphamide .  For  patients receiving other  chemotherapy  of  moderate emetic risk , the Up date Committee continues to recommend the two-drug combination of a  5-HT3 receptor serotonin antagonist and dexamethasone .  In all patients receiving  cisplatin  and all other agents of high emetic risk , the two-drug combination of  dexamethasone and aprepitant  is recommended for the prevention of  delayed emesis .  The Up date Committee no longer recommends the combination of a  5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist and dexamethasone  for the prevention of  delayed emesis  after chemotherapeutic agents of high emetic risk .  The Up date Committee recommends that clinicians administer antiemetics while considering patients ' emetic risk categories and other characteristics."
"sAnatomical changes in the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent weight loss may influence drug disposition and thus drug dosing  following  bariatric surgery .   This review systematic ally examines the effects of  bariatric surgery  on  drug pharmacokinetics  , focusing especially on the mechanisms involved in restricting oral bioavailability . Studies with a longitudinal before-after design investigating the pharmacokinetics of at least one drug were review ed . The need for dose adjustment following  bariatric surgery  was examined , as well as the potential for extrapolation to other drugs subjected to coinciding pharmacokinetic mechanisms .  A total of 22 original articles and 32 different drugs were assessed .  The majority of available data is based on  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass  (  RYGBP  ) ( 18 of 22 studies ) , and hence , the overall interpretation is more or less limited to RYGBP . In the case of the majority of studied drugs , an increased  absorption rate  was observed early after RYGBP . The effect on systemic exposure allows for a low degree of extrapolation , including between drugs subjected to the same major metabolic and transporter pathways . On the basis of current underst and ing , predicting the pharmacokinetic change for a specific drug following RYGBP is challenging . Close monitoring of each individual drug is therefore recommended in the early postsurgical phase . Future studies should focus on the long-term effects of  bariatric surgery  on  drug disposition  , and they should also aim to disentangle the effects of the surgery itself and the subsequent weight loss."
"lLow serum concentrations of  25-hydroxyvitamin  D ( 25[OH]D ) have been associated with many non-skeletal disorders . However , whether low 25(OH)D is the cause or result of ill health is not known . We did a systematic search of prospect i ve and intervention studies that assessed the effect of 25(OH)D concentrations on  non-skeletal health  outcomes in  individuals aged 18 years or older .  We identified  290 prospect i ve cohort studies ( 279 on  disease  occurrence or mortality , and 11 on  cancer  characteristics or survival ) , and 172 r and omised trials of major health outcomes and of physiological parameters related to disease risk or inflammatory status .  Investigators of most prospect i ve studies reported moderate to strong inverse associations  between 25(OH)D concentrations and cardiovascular diseases , serum lipid concentrations , inflammation , glucose metabolism disorders , weight gain , infectious diseases , multiple sclerosis , mood disorders , declining cognitive function , impaired physical functioning , and all-cause mortality .  High 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with a lower risk of cancer , except  colorectal  cancer . Results from intervention studies did not show an effect of   vitamin D supplementation  on disease occurrence  , including  colorectal cancer .  In 34 intervention studies including  2805 individuals with  mean 25(OH)D concentration  lower than 50 nmol/L at baseline  supplementation with 50 μg per day or more did not show better results  .   Supplementation in elderly people ( mainly women )  with 20 μg  vitamin D  per day seemed to slightly reduce  all-cause mortality .  The discrepancy between observational and intervention studies suggests that low 25(OH)D is a marker of ill health . Inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course would reduce  25(OH)D  , which would explain why low vitamin D status is reported in a wide range of disorders .  In elderly people  , restoration of vitamin D deficits due to ageing and lifestyle changes induced by ill health could explain why low-dose supplementation leads to slight gains in survival."
"tObjective To critically appraise and compare the measurement properties of  self-administered patient-reported outcome measures ( PROMs )  focussing on the shoulder , assessing “ activity limitations . ” Study design Systematic review . The  study population had to consist of patients with shoulder pain . We excluded postoperative patients or patients with generic diseases .  The method ological quality of the selected studies and the results of the measurement properties were critically appraised and rated using the COSMIN checklist . Results Out of a total of  3427 unique hits , 31  articles , evaluating 7 different question naires , were included . The SPADI is the most frequently evaluated PROM and its measurement properties seem adequate apart from a lack of information regarding its measurement error and content validity . Conclusion For  English , Norwegian and Turkish users  , we recommend to use the SPADI .  Dutch users  could use either the  SDQ  or the SST . In German , we recommend the DASH . In Tamil , Slovene , Spanish and the Danish language s , the evaluated PROMs were not yet of acceptable validity . None of these PROMs showed strong positive evidence for all measurement properties . We propose to develop a new shoulder PROM focused on activity limitations , taking new knowledge and techniques into account."
"nINTRODUCTION Despite the availability of evidence -based guidelines for the management of  low back pain ( LBP )  that contain consistent messages , large evidence - practice gaps in primary care remain . OBJECTIVES To perform a systematic review and meta synthesis of qualitative studies that have explored  primary care clinicians '  perceptions and beliefs about guidelines for LBP , including perceived enablers and barriers to guideline adherence . METHODS Studies investigating perceptions and beliefs about  LBP guidelines  were included if  participants were primary care clinicians  and  qualitative methods  had been used for both data collection and analysis . We search ed  major data bases up to July 2014 .  Pairs of review ers independently screened titles and abstract s , extracted data , appraised method quality using the CASP checklist , conducted thematic analysis , and synthesized the results in narrative format . RESULTS  Seventeen studies , with a total of 705 participants , were included .  We identified 3 key emergent themes and 8 subthemes : ( 1 )  guideline implementation and adherence beliefs and perceptions ; (  2  ) maintaining the patient-clinician relationship with imaging referrals ;  and ( 3 )  barriers to guideline implementation .  Clinicians believed that guidelines were categorical , prescriptive , and constrained professional practice ; however , popular clinical practice s superseded the guidelines . Imaging referrals were used to manage consultations and to obtain definitive diagnoses . Clinicians ' perceptions reflected a lack of content knowledge and underst and ing of how guidelines are developed . DISCUSSION Addressing misconceptions and other barriers to uptake of evidence -based guidelines for managing LBP is needed to improve knowledge transfer and close the evidence - practice gap in the treatment of this common condition."
"eBackground The increasing prevalence of  obesity in the pediatric age range  has become a major concern . Studies have investigated the role of  physical activity ( PA )  to prevent obesity in this population . However , previous review s did not focus on the effects of  PA  in  overweight/obese adolescents  on physical fitness and risk factors for cardiovascular disease altogether . Objective The present systematic review analyzed trials investigating the effect of  PA  on  aerobic capacity , muscle strength , body composition , hemodynamic variables , biochemical markers , and endothelial function  in  obese/overweight adolescents .  Methods PubMed , LILACS , Web of Science , Scopus ( including Embase ) , and SPORTD iscus data bases were search ed for relevant reports without time limits .  Inclusion criteria included studies published in English , with overweight and obese adolescents aged 12–17 years .  The review was registered ( Number CRD42013004632 ) on PROSPERO , the International Prospect i ve Register of Systematic Review s. Results The results indicated  that PA  is associated with significant  and beneficial changes in fat percentage , waist circumference , systolic blood pressure , insulin , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and total cholesterol  , as well as with  small non-significant changes in diastolic blood pressure , glucose , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol .  Conclusion Although limited , results from controlled trials suggest  that PA intervention  may  improve physical fitness and risk factors for cardiovascular disease  in adolescents who are overweight or obese."
" Synthesized evidence indicates that addition of multiple  micronutrients  to  Fe supplementation  may only marginally improve  Hb response  compared with  Fe  supplementation alone . However , addition of ' other micronutrients ' may have a negative effect . Routine addition of unselected multiple  micronutrients  to  Fe  therefore appears unjustified for nutritional anaemia control programmes."
"tAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is typically diagnosed using clinical observation and subjective informant reports . Once  children  commence ADHD medication , robust monitoring is required to detect partial or non-responses . The extent to which  neuropsychological continuous performance tests ( CPTs )  and  objective measures of activity  can clinical ly aid the assessment and titration process in ADHD is not fully understood . This review describes the current evidence base for the use of  CPTs  and objective ly measured activity to support the diagnostic procedure and medication management for  children with ADHD .  Four data bases ( PsycINFO , Medline , Allied and Complementary Medicine ( AMED ) , and PsycARTICLES ) were systematic ally search ed to underst and the current evidence base for ( 1 ) the use of  CPTs  to aid clinical assessment of ADHD ; ( 2 ) the use of  CPTs  to aid medication management ; and ( 3 ) the clinical utility of objective measures of activity in ADHD .  Sixty relevant articles were identified .  The search revealed six commercially available  CPTs  that had been reported on for their clinical use . There were mixed findings with regard to the use of  CPTs  to assess and manage medication , with contrasting evidence on their ability to support clinical decision-making . There was a strong evidence base for the use of  objective measures of activity  to aid  ADHD/non-ADHD group differentiation  , which appears sensitive to medication effects and would also benefit from further research on their clinical utility . The findings suggest that combining  CPTs  and an  objective measure of activity  may be particularly useful as a clinical tool and worthy of further pursuit."
 We developed FreKAQ-J by modifying the FreBAQ-J. The FreKAQ-J fits the Rasch measurement model well and is suitable for use in people with  knee OA .  Altered body perception may be worth evaluating when managing people with knee OA.
"yDespite the numerous studies , there is no consensus concerning the best approach for   total hip arthroplasty ( THA )   , and debates are ongoing . The purpose of this study was to perform a Bayesian  network meta- analysis  ( NMA ) comparing several approaches for  primary THA .  The focus was on peri-operative outcomes :  surgical duration , total estimated blood loss , and length of the hospitalization .  This Bayesian network meta- analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA extension statement for reporting systematic review s incorporating network meta-analyses of health care interventions . In October 2019 , the main data bases were accessed . All the clinical trials comparing two or more different approaches for primary  THA  were assessed . For the methodology quality assessment , the PEDro score was performed . The Software STATA MP was used for the statistical analyses . The NMA was performed through the routine for Bayesian hierarchical r and om-effects analysis with the inverse variance statistic method for continuous variables .  Data from 4843 procedures was analysed  . Between  patient  ’s demographic , good baseline comparability was found . The comparison  total estimated blood loss  detected statistically significant inconsistency ( P = 0.01 ) . The posterolateral approach reported the lowest  value  for  the surgical duration .  The test for  overall inconsistency  was statistically significant ( P = 0.4 ) . The posterolateral approach reported the  shortest hospitalization length .  The test for  overall inconsistency  was statistically significant ( P = 0.9 ) . The posterolateral approach reported  shorter surgical duration and hospitalization length .  Concerning the analysis of  total estimated blood loss  , no significant result was obtained . Data must be considered in the light of the limitations of the present study."
"eThe purpose of the activity reported in this article was to conduct an exhaustive search of the Journal of   Music Therapy   , filter the articles on the desired parameters , and organize data for analysis and interpretation . Specifically , the research er studied whether ( a ) there was a significant difference in  physiological measures  , ( b ) there was a significant difference in  quality of life  , ( c ) there was a significant difference in  satisfaction levels  , ( d ) there was a significant difference in  pain reduction  , ( e ) there was a significant difference in  procedural length  , ( f ) there was a significant difference in  length of stay  , and ( g ) whether the overall effect size and 95 % confidence level support the recommendation of  music therapy  in the health care setting .  Twenty-four studies met criteria for inclusion in the systematic review .  Results revealed an overall effect size of d = 0.61 . However , results of the 95 % confidence interval included 0 , which suggests that there may not be a statistically significant difference in the health care setting on desired measures . Further results and implication s are discussed within the article."
" Quitting smoking is associated with a substantial reduction in  risk of all-cause mortality  among  patients with CHD .  The pooled  crude RR  was 0.64 ( 95 % CI 0.58 to 0.71 ) . This 36 % risk reduction appears substantial compared with other secondary preventive therapies such as cholesterol lowering which have received greater attention in recent years . The risk reduction associated with quitting smoking seems consistent regardless of differences between the studies in terms of index cardiac events , age , sex , country , and time period . However , relatively few studies have included  large  numbers  of older people , women , or people of non-European descent  , and  most were  carried out in  Western countries ."
" : The method ological  quality  of the RCTs as assessed according to the 19 different criteria varied considerably .

" Compared to  placebo , aliskiren  lowered BP and this effect is dose-dependent . This magnitude of BP lowering effect is similar to that for angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) . There is no difference in  mortality , nonfatal serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse effects  with short term  aliskiren  monotherapy .  Diarrhoea  was considerably increased with  aliskiren  600 mg."
"eDespite advances in our underst and ing of  surgical site infections following total joint arthroplasty  , this serious surgical complication continues to represent a substantial economic burden for the patient , the treating institution and the healthcare system . After increasing for the past decade , infection rates have stabilized at 1.6 % ; however , the total cost is projected to increase with the total number of revision procedures performed . A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies that assess the efficacy of  pre- , peri- and post-operative infection prevention strategies  in the setting of  total hip or knee arthroplasty .  Preference was given to r and omized-controlled trials , data from national registries and meta-analyses within the past 5 years ; however , all relevant articles were included in this analysis . The results of the literature search returned  549 articles that addressed infection in total joint arthroplasty  , of which 71 specifically  addressed infection  prevention  .  Topics that were addressed included the  CDC recommendations , skin preparation techniques , hair removal techniques , surgical draping techniques , operative dress , operating room ventilation , operating room traffic and antibiotic utilization .  Newer infection prevention techniques , such as  preoperative antiseptic scrubbing  , are affected and may help reduce the  infection rate  , while traditionally accepted methods of prophylaxis such as laminar-flow operating rooms and body exhaust suits may raise the infection rate."
" Evidence from observational studies indicates inverse associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D with  risks of death due to cardiovascular disease , cancer , and other causes .   Supplementation  with  vitamin D3  significantly reduces  overall mortality   among older adults ;  however , before any widespread supplementation , further investigations will be required to establish the optimal dose and duration and whether  vitamin D3 and D2  have different effects on  mortality risk ."

"sIn this systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , the effects of  vitamin D supplementation  on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in  diabetic patients  are summarized . The following data bases were search ed up to December 2017 : MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . The quality of the relevant extracted data was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool . Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as mean difference with 95 % Confidence Intervals ( 95 % CI ) . Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and I-squared tests ( I2 ) . Overall ,  33 studies were included in the meta-analyses .   Vitamin D supplementation  were found to significantly reduce  serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP )  ( WMD 0.27 ; 95 % CI , - 0.35 , - 0.20 ; p<0.001 ) and  malondialdehyde ( MDA ) levels  ( WMD - 0.43 , 95 % CI - 0.62 , - 0.25 , p<0.001 ) in  diabetic  patients . In  addition , vitamin D supplementation  were found to increase  markers of nitric oxide ( NO ) release  ( WMD 4.33 , 95 % CI 0.96 , 7.70 ) ,  total serum antioxidant capacity ( TAC )  ( WMD 57.34 , 95 % CI 33.48 , 81.20 , p<0.001 ) and  total glutathione ( GSH ) levels  ( WMD 82.59 , 95 % CI 44.37 , 120.81 , p<0.001 ) . Overall , this meta- analysis shows  that in diabetic patients  ,  taking vitamin D  had significant effects on  hs-CRP and MDA levels  , and significantly increased NO , TAC and GSH levels."
"sExercise tests are often used to evaluate the functional status of  patients with COPD .  However , to the best of our knowledge , a comprehensive systematic comparison of these tests has not been performed . We systematic ally review ed studies reporting the repeatability and /or reproducibility of these tests , and studies comparing their sensitivity to therapeutic intervention . A systematic review identified  primary manuscripts in English reporting relevant data  on the following exercise tests :  6-minute  walk test  ( 6MWT ) and  12-minute walk test  ,  incremental and endurance shuttle walk tests ( ISWT  and  ESWT  , respectively ) ,  incremental and endurance cycle ergometer tests  , and  incremental  and  endurance treadmill tests .   We identified  71 relevant studies .  Good  repeatability  ( for the  6MWT  and ESWT ) and  reproducibility ( for the 6MWT , 12-minute walk test , ISWT , ESWT , and incremental cycle ergometer test )  were reported by most studies assessing these tests , providing patients were familiarized with them beforeh and . The 6MWT , ISWT , and particularly the ESWT were reported to be sensitive to therapeutic intervention . Protocol variations ( eg , track layout or supplemental oxygen use ) affected performance significantly in several studies . This review shows that while the validity of several tests has been established , for others further study is required . Future work will assess the link between these tests , physiological mechanisms , and patient-reported measures."
"eFatigue is a disabling , multifaceted symptom that is highly prevalent and stubbornly persistent . Although fatigue is a frequent complaint among  patients with fibromyalgia  , it has not received the same attention as pain . Reasons for this include lack of st and ardized nomenclature to communicate about fatigue , lack of evidence -based guidelines for fatigue assessment , and a deficiency in effective treatment strategies .  Fatigue  does not occur in isolation ; rather , it is present concurrently in varying severity with other fibromyalgia symptoms such as chronic widespread pain , unrefreshing sleep , anxiety , depression , cognitive difficulties , and so on . Survey-based and preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that multiple symptoms feed into fatigue and it may be associated with a variety of physiological mechanisms . Therefore ,  fatigue  assessment in clinical and research setting s must consider this multi-dimensionality . While no clinical trial to date has specifically targeted  fatigue  , r and omized controlled trials , systematic review s , and meta-analyses indicate that treatment modalities studied in the context of other fibromyalgia symptoms could also improve  fatigue .  The  Outcome Measures  in Rheumatology ( OMERACT ) Fibromyalgia Working Group and the  Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System  ( PROMIS ) have been instrumental in propelling the study of  fatigue  in fibromyalgia to the forefront . The ongoing efforts by PROMIS to develop a brief fibromyalgia-specific  fatigue measure  for use in clinical and research setting s will help define fatigue , allow for better assessment , and advance our underst and ing of fatigue."

"nBackground  Physical activity ( PA )  is essential for  children  throughout their growth and maturation . It improves physiological and psychological health and limits the risk of developing metabolic disorders . However , some chronic physiological and metabolic diseases may lead to decreased PA . The diversity of outcomes in the literature offers no consensus for  physical activity  and  sedentary levels  in  children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) or inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .  Methods A literature review and a meta- analysis were carried out with original studies from a Medline data base search . Only high- quality studies ( STROBE checklist ) written in English comparing   PA level  or  sedentary behavior ( SB )   between  children with the disorders and their healthy peers  were considered . The aim was to examine   PA  and  SB   in  children with JIA or IBD compared to their healthy peers .  Results The literature review and meta- analysis identified  decreased PA and increased time spent in SB  in these population s , which may exacerbate both their lower  physical fitness  and the symptoms of their health disorders . Conclusion Results nevertheless show discrepancies due to the different material s and methods used and the variables measured . Further studies are needed to establish a gold st and ard method for assessing  PA level  in these population."

"ePurpose  Patient-specific instruments ( PSIs )  are already in relatively common use , and their post-operative radiographic results are equal to those for  total knee arthroplasty ( TKA )  with conventional instrumentation .  PSI  use requires a preoperative  MRI scan , CT scan  , or a combination  of MRI and a long-leg st and ing radiograph .  However , there is no consensus as to which of these modalities ,  MRI or CT  , is the preferred imaging modality when performing TKA with PSIs . Methods This systematic literature review and meta- analysis studied the differences in alignment outliers between   CT- and MRI-based PSI  for TKA .  A search of the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s , MEDLINE / PubMed and Embase was conducted , without restriction on date of publication .  Only level I evidence studies written in English that included TKA with the use of  MRI- and CT-based PSI  were selected .  A meta- analysis was then performed of the rate of outliers in the biomechanical axis and individual femoral and tibial component alignment . Where considerable heterogeneity among studies was present or the data did not provide sufficient information for performing the meta- analysis , a qualitative synthesis was undertaken . Results  Twelve r and omized controlled trials , study ing 841 knees ,  were eligible for data extraction and meta- analysis .  MRI-based PSI  result ed in a significantly lower  proportion of coronal plane outliers  with regard to the lateral femoral component ( OR 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.30–0.89 , P = 0.02 ) , without significant heterogeneity ( n.s . ) . There were no significant differences regarding the  biomechanical  axis or  frontal femoral and individual  tibial component alignment . Conclusion This systematic review and meta- analysis demonstrate that alignment with  MRI-based PSI  is at least as good as , if not better than , that with  CT-based PSI .  To prevent for malalignment ,  MRI  should be the imaging modality of choice when performing TKA surgery with  PSI.Level  of evidence."
"lBACKGROUND  Probiotic therapies with different strains  demonstrated some beneficial  effects  , although some studies did not show any significant effects . This study assessed systematic ally the current knowledge on the effect of  probiotic bacteria  on duration of   acute rotavirus diarrhea  in children compared  with control . METHODS The PubMed , Cochrane Controlled Trial Register ( CCTR ) and Ovid ( Wolters Kluwer Health ) were search ed between 1980 to June 15 , 2013 . R and omized controlled trials including the administration of  probiotics  for treatment of  rotavirus diarrhea in infants and children  were review ed . RESULTS  A total number of 1244 articles were found through the aforementioned search . 203 articles were selected after the first screening of title and abstract .  The intervention group included  subjects who received  probiotic strains and dosage in any conditions .  Placebo or any similar vehicle without probiotic  was used in the controlled trials .  Finally , 14 articles were selected .  The outcomes from each study were considered in the  duration of diarrhea .  Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software . The pooled estimate of  efficacy of probiotics  in prevention or treatment of disease yielded in all studies a mean difference of 0.41 ( CI 95 % : -0.56 to -0.25 ; p<0.001 ) . The pooled estimate of  efficacy  of lactobacillus  rhamnosus GG  and other probiotics  significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea .  Among trials , the overall  reduction  of  LGG  was 0.47 ( CI 95 % : -0.80 to -0.14 ; P= 0.020 ) .  In conclusion , probiotics exert positive effect in reducing the  duration of  acute rotavirus diarrhea   compared with control."
"rLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide . For early stages of the disease ,  lung resection surgery  remains the best treatment with curative intent , but significant morbidity is associated , especially among  patients with poor pulmonary function and cardiorespiratory fitness .  In those cases , the implementation of a  preoperative exercise-based intervention  could optimize patient 's functional status before surgery and improve postoperative outcomes and enhance recovery . The aim of this systematic review is to provide the current body of knowledge regarding the effectiveness of a  preoperative exercise-based intervention  on postoperative and functional outcomes in  patients with lung cancer su bmi tted to lung resection surgery .  A systematic review of the literature using CINAHL , EMBASE , MEDLINE , Pubmed , PEDro and SCOPUS was undertaken in September 2015 yielding a total of  1656 references  . Two independent review ers performed the assessment of the potentially eligible  records  against the inclusion criteria and finally ,  21 articles were included  in the review . Articles were included if they examined the effects of an  exercise-based intervention  on at least one of the selected outcomes :  pulmonary function , ( functional ) exercise capacity , health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) and postoperative outcomes ( length of stay and postoperative complications ) .   Fourteen studies  were further selected for a meta- analysis to quantify the mean effect of the intervention and generate 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) using the Cochrane Review Manager 5.0.25 . For two of the outcomes included  ( exercise capacity and HRQoL )  , studies showed large heterogeneity and thus , a meta- analysis was considered inappropriate .  Pulmonary function ( forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s )  was significantly enhanced after the intervention [ st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) = 0.38 ; 95 % CI 0.14 , 0.63 and SMD = 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.11 , 0.42 , respectively ] . In comparison with the patients in the control groups , patients in the experimental groups  spent less days in the hospital  ( mean difference = -4.83 , 95 % CI -5.9 , -3.76 ) and had a significantly  reduced risk for developing postoperative complications  ( risk ratios = 0.45 ; 95 % CI 0.28 , 0.74 ) . In conclusion , preoperative  exercise-based training  improves  pulmonary function  before surgery and  reduces in-hospital length of stay and postoperative complications  after lung resection surgery for lung cancer."

"SThe aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence from r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the effectiveness of  interactive digital interventions ( IDIs ) for  physical activity ( PA )   and   health related quality of life ( HRQoL )   in  people with Inflammatory Arthritis [ rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) axial Spondyloarthritis ( AS ) and psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) ] .  Seven electronic data bases identified published and unpublished studies . Two review ers conducted independent data extraction and quality assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias tool ( RoB ) . The primary outcome was  change in objective PA  after the intervention  ;  secondary outcomes  included self-reported PA and HRQoL after  the  intervention and objective or self-reported PA  at least 1  year  later . Five manuscripts , reporting four RCTs ( three high and one low RoB ) representing  492 ( 459 RA , 33 JIA ) participants  were included . No trials study ing PsA or AS met the inclusion criteria . Interventions ranged from 6 to 52 weeks and included 3–18 Behaviour  Change  Techniques . Due to heterogeneity of outcomes , a narrative synthesis was conducted . No trials reported any significant between group differences  in objective PA  at end of intervention . Only one low RoB trial found a significant between group  difference in self-reported vigorous  [ MD Δ 0.9 days ( 95 % CI 0.3 , 1.5 ) ; p = 0.004 ] ,  but not moderate , PA  in  people  with RA but not JIA . There were no between group differences in any other secondary outcomes . There is very limited evidence for the effectiveness of IDIs  on PA and HRQoL  in RA and JIA and no evidence for their effectiveness in PsA or AS."

"sSuccessful treatment of  first-episode psychosis  is one of the major factors that impacts long-term prognosis . Currently , there are no satisfactory biological markers ( biomarkers ) to predict which  patients with a first-episode psychosis  will respond to which treatment . In addition , a non-negligible rate of patients does not respond to any treatment or may develop side effects that affect adherence to the treatments as well as negatively impact physical health . Thus , there clearly is a pressing need for defining biomarkers that may be helpful to predict response to treatment and sensitivity to side effects in  first-episode psychosis .  The present systematic review provides ( 1 ) trials that assessed  biological markers  associated  with antipsychotic response  or  side  effects in  first-episode psychosis  and ( 2 ) potential biomarkers associated with biological disturbances that may guide the choice of  conventional treatments  or the prescription of  innovative treatments .  Trials including  first-episode psychoses  are few in number . Most of the available data focused on pharmacogenetics markers with so far only preliminary results . To date , these studies yielded-beside markers for  metabolism of antipsychotics-no  or only a few biomarkers for  response or side effects  , none of which have been implemented in daily clinical practice . Other biomarkers exploring  immunoinflammatory , oxidative , and hormonal disturbances  emerged as biomarkers of first-episode psychoses in the last decades , and some of them have been associated with treatment response . In addition to pharmacogenetics , further efforts should focus on the association of emergent biomarkers with conventional treatments or with innovative therapies efficacy , where some preliminary data suggest promising results."
"sBackground :  Women  are at substantially greater risk for  anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries  than are  men .  Purpose : To conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of the literature to clarify the effect of the  menstrual cycle  and  contraceptives  on the laxity of and noncontact injuries to the ACL . Study Design : Systematic review ; Level of evidence , 4 . Methods : Search es were conducted using MEDLINE ( 1946–August 2016  )  , the Cochrane Library Data base , clinical trial registries , and related reference lists . Search terms included athletic injuries , knee injuries , ligaments , joint instability , menstrual cycle , ovulation , hormones , and contraceptives . Investigators independently dually abstract ed and review ed study details and quality using predefined criteria and evaluated overall strength of evidence using the GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) criteria . Results :  Twenty-one studies totaling 68,758 participants were included : 5 on the menstrual cycle and ACL injury , 7 on  hormonal contraceptives  and ACL injury  ,  as well  as  13 on menstrual cycle and ligament laxity .  Four of 5 studies of women not using hormonal contraception indicated that the luteal phase was the least associated with ACL injuries . The 2 largest and highest quality studies on  hormonal contraceptives  suggested that  hormonal contraceptives  may be protective against ACL injury . Six of 12 studies on  ACL laxity  provided quantitative data for meta- analysis , finding significantly increased  laxity  during the ovulatory phase compared with the follicular phase . Conclusion : The literature suggests an association between  hormonal  fluctuations and  ACL injury .  Recent studies have suggested that  oral contraceptives  may offer up to a 20 % reduction  in risk of injury .  The literature on ACL injuries and the menstrual cycle has more than doubled over the past decade , permitting quantitative analysis for the first time . However , the overall strength of this evidence is low . Promising potential directions for future research include long-term observational studies with ongoing hormonal assays and large interventional trials of follicular suppression , including newer hormonal methods."
"tBACKGROUND Cancer Care Ontario 's Program in Evidence -Based Care ( pebc ) recently created an evidence -based consensus guideline on the systemic treatment of  early breast cancer .  The evidence for the guideline was compiled using a systematic review to answer the question "" What is the optimal  systemic therapy  for  patients with early-stage , operable breast cancer  , when  patient and disease factors  are considered ? "" The question was addressed in three parts :  cytotoxic chemotherapy , endocrine treatment ,  and  her2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-targeted therapy .  METHODS For the systematic review , the literature in the  medline and embase data bases  was search ed for the  period January 2008 to May 2014 .  The St and ards and Guidelines Evidence directory of cancer guidelines and the Web sites of major oncology guideline organizations were also search ed . The basic search terms were "" breast cancer "" and  ""  systemic  therapy "" ( chemotherapy , endocrine therapy , targeted agents , ovarian suppression )  , and results were limited to r and omized controlled trials ( rcts ) , guidelines , systematic review s , and meta-analyses . RESULTS  Several hundred documents that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved  . Meta-analyses from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists ' Collaborative Group encompassed many of the rcts found . Several additional studies that met the inclusion criteria were retained , as were other guidelines and systematic review s. SUMMARY The results of the systematic review constitute a comprehensive compilation of high-level evidence , which was the basis for the 2014 pebc guideline on systemic therapy for early breast cancer . The review of the evidence for  systemic endocrine therapy ( adjuvant tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitors  , and ovarian ablation and suppression ) is presented here ; the evidence for  chemotherapy and her2-targeted treatment-  and the final clinical practice recommendations -are presented separately in this supplement."

"]QUESTION What are physiotherapists ' perceptions about identifying and managing the cognitive , psychological and social factors that may act as barriers to recovery for  people with low back pain ( LBP )  ? DESIGN Systematic review and qualitative meta synthesis of qualitative studies in which physiotherapists were question ed , using  focus groups or semi-structured interviews  , about identifying  and  managing  cognitive , psychological and social factors  in people with LBP . PARTICIPANTS  Qualified physiotherapists with experience in treating patients with LBP .  OUTCOME MEASURES Studies were synthesis ed in narrative format and thematic analysis was used to provide a collective insight into the physiotherapists ' perceptions . RESULTS Three main themes emerged : physiotherapists only partially recognised cognitive , psychological and social factors in LBP , with most discussion around factors such as family , work and unhelpful patient expectations ; some physiotherapists stigmatised patients with LBP as dem and ing , attention-seeking and poorly motivated when they presented with behaviours suggestive of these factors ; and physiotherapists question ed the relevance of screening for these factors because they were perceived to extend beyond their scope of practice , with many feeling under-skilled in addressing them .  Physiotherapists partially recognised cognitive , psychological and social factors in people with LBP . Physiotherapists expressed a preference for dealing with the more mechanical aspects of LBP , and some stigmatised the behaviours suggestive of cognitive , psychological and social contributions to LBP . Physiotherapists perceived that neither their initial training , nor currently available professional development training , instilled them with the requisite skills and confidence to successfully address and treat the multidimensional pain presentations seen in LBP .

"sOBJECTIVE To eluci date the benefits of using  probiotics  in the prevention of   necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC )  and its complications in preterm newborns .  METHOD This was a systematic review of r and omized controlled trials , which included studies retrieved from three data bases ( MEDLINE , Embase , and LILACS ) , using a combination of the terms ( necrotizing enterocolitis ) AND  ( probiotics ) .  RESULTS  11 r and omized trials were included , totaling 2,887 patients , 1,431 in the  probiotic  group and 1,456 in the  control  group .  There was a reduction in the  incidence of NEC  ( NNT=25 ) ,  overall death  ( NNT=34 ) , and  neonatal sepsis  ( NNT=34 ) in the probiotic group compared to the control group . Patients that received  probiotic supplementation  had  lower food re introduction time  ( p<0.001 ) and  hospitalization time  ( p<0.001 ) when compared to those not receiving  probiotics .  There was  no  difference  in mortality  caused by NEC .  In  premature newborns  , the use of  probiotics  is effective as a prophylaxis for NEC and its complications."
")QUESTION What is the optimal  chemotherapy regimen  in  advanced gastric cancer  ? PERSPECTIVES Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide . Despite low incidence rates for  gastric cancer  in  Ontario  , the overall prognosis is bleak , with 5-year survival rates of approximately 23 % in  Canada  . Even with the considerable body of research available on  chemotherapy  for advanced gastric cancer , uncertainty remains . There is no recognized st and ard treatment , and there appears to be geographic variation in practice . OUTCOMES Outcomes of interest were  overall survival , objective response rate ( complete plus partial responses ) , time to disease progression , adverse effects , and quality of life .  METHODOLOGY After a systematic review , a practice guideline containing clinical recommendations relevant to  patients in Ontario  was drafted . The practice guideline was review ed and approved by the Gastrointestinal Disease Site Group ( gi dsg ) and the Report Approval Panel of the Program in Evidence -Based Care . External review by Ontario practitioners was obtained through a survey , the results of which were incorporated into the practice guideline . PRACTICE GUIDELINE The gi dsg makes the following recommendations : To improve  survival  , a platinum agent should be included in any combination chemotherapy regimen . Within a combination chemotherapy regimen ,  oral capecitabine  is preferred over  intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5fu)-that  is ,  epirubicin-cisplatin-capecitabine  is preferred over the prior st and ard regimen ,  epirubicin-cisplatin-5fu  (ecf).Epirubicin-oxaliplatin-capecitabine ( eox ) is a reasonable alternative to ecf . The choice between ecf and eox should be based on patient preference .  Trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine ( 5fu or oral capecitabine )  is recommended for  advanced gastric cancer positive for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  ( her2/neu )."

"DPURPOSE A systematic review of  behavioural intervention  for the treatment of  adults with muscle tension voice disorders ( MTVD ) .  METHOD A search of  12 electronic data bases and reference lists for studies published between the years 1990 - 2014  was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines . Inclusion and exclusion criteria included type of publication , participant characteristics , intervention , outcome measures and report of outcomes . Method ological  quality rating scales and confidence in diagnostic scale  supported the literature evaluation . RESULT  Seven papers  met the inclusion criteria . Significant improvement on at least one  outcome  measure was reported for all studies .  Effect sizes  were small-to-large . Method ological qualities of research were varied . No study explicitly reported  treatment fidelity and cumulative intervention intensity  could only be calculated for two out of seven studies .  Outcome measures  were used inconsistently and less than half of the measures had reported  reliability values . Confidence in the accuracy of subject diagnosis  on average was rated as low . Specific "" active ingredients "" for therapeutic change were not identified .

"yPURPOSE To identify and appraise the literature on clinical measures of  spasticity  that has been  investigated in people after stroke .  METHODS The literature search involved four data bases ( PubMed , CINAHL , Embase and The Cochrane Library ) up to February  2014  . The selected studies included those that aim ed to measure spasticity using a  clinical assessment  tool among  adult patients post-stroke .  Two independent raters review ed the included articles using a critical appraisal scale and a structured data extraction form . RESULTS A total of  40 studies examining 15  spasticity assessment tools  in patients post-stroke  were review ed . None of the review ed measurement tools demonstrated satisfactory results for all psychometric properties evaluated , and the majority lacked evidence concerning validity and absolute reliability .  This systematic review found limited evidence to support the use of most of clinical measures of spasticity for  people post-stroke .  Future research examining the application and psychometric properties of these measures is warranted . Implication s for Rehabilitation There is a need for objective clinical tools for measuring spasticity that are clinical ly feasible and easily interpreted by clinicians . This review identified various clinical measures of spasticity that have been investigated in  people after stroke .  Insufficient evidence of psychometric properties precludes recommending one tool over the others . Future research should focus on investigating the  psychometric properties  of clinical measures of spasticity."
"IAccumulating evidence suggests that , independent of physical activity levels ,  sedentary behaviours  are associated with increased  risk  of  cardio-metabolic disease , all-cause mortality  , and a variety of  physiological  and psychological  problems  . Therefore , the purpose of this systematic review is to determine the relationship between sedentary behaviour and  health indicators  in  school-aged children and youth aged 5 - 17 years .  Online data bases ( MEDLINE , EMBASE and PsycINFO ) , personal libraries and government documents were search ed for relevant studies examining time spent engaging in  sedentary behaviours  and six specific health indicators ( body composition , fitness , metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease , self-esteem , pro-social behaviour and academic achievement ) .  232 studies including 983,840 participants met inclusion criteria and were included in the review .   Television ( TV ) watching  was the most common measure of sedentary behaviour and  body composition  was the most common outcome measure . Qualitative analysis of all studies revealed a dose-response relation between  increased sedentary behaviour and unfavourable health outcomes .  Watching TV for more than 2 hours per day was associated with  unfavourable body composition , decreased fitness , lowered scores for self-esteem and pro-social behaviour and decreased academic achievement .  Meta- analysis was completed for r and omized controlled studies that aim ed to reduce sedentary time and reported change in  body mass index ( BMI )  as their primary outcome . In this regard , a meta- analysis revealed an overall significant effect of -0.81 ( 95 % CI of -1.44 to -0.17 , p = 0.01 ) indicating an overall decrease in  mean BMI  associated with the interventions . There is a large body of evidence from all study design s which suggests that decreasing any type of sedentary time is associated with lower health risk in  youth aged 5 - 17 years .  In particular , the evidence suggests that daily TV viewing in excess of 2 hours is associated with reduced  physical and psychosocial health  , and that lowering sedentary time leads to reductions in BMI."
"sBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE An increasing interest in the potential benefits of  cognitive motor interference ( CMI )  for stroke has recently been observed , but the efficacy of  CMI  for gait and balance is controversial . A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials was performed to estimate the effect of  CMI  on gait and balance in  patients with stroke .  METHODS Articles in Medline , EMBASE , the Cochrane Library , Web of Science , CINAHL , PEDro and the China Biology Medicine disc were search ed from 1970 to July 2014 . Only r and omized controlled trials examining the effects of  CMI   for patients with stroke  were included , and no language restrictions were applied . Main outcome measures  included gait and balance function .  RESULTS  A total of 15 studies composed of 395 participants met the inclusion criteria , and 13 studies of 363 participants were used as data sources  for the meta-  analysis  . Pooling revealed that  CMI  was superior to the control group for  gait speed  [ mean difference ( MD ) 0.19 m/s , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( 0.06 , 0.31 ) , P = 0.003 ] ,  stride length  [ MD 12.53 cm , 95 % CI ( 4.07 , 20.99 ) , P = 0.004 ] ,  cadence  [ MD 10.44 steps/min , 95 % CI ( 4.17 , 16.71 ) , P = 0.001 ] ,  centre of pressure sway area  [ MD -1.05 , 95 % CI ( -1.85 , -0.26 ) , P = 0.01 ] and  Berg balance scale  [ MD 2.87 , 95 % CI ( 0.54 , 5.21 ) , P = 0.02 ] in the short term .   Cognitive motor interference  is effective for improving  gait and balance function  for stroke in the short term . However , only little evidence supports assumptions regarding  CMI 's  long-term benefits."
"sBackground Solutions delivered within firm sectoral boundaries are inadequate in achieving income security and better health for  poor population s.   Integrated microfinance and health interventions  leverage networks of women to promote financial inclusion , build livelihoods , and safeguard against high cost illnesses . Our underst and ing of the effect of  integrated interventions  has been limited by variability in intervention , outcome , design , and method ological rigour . This systematic review synthesis es the literature  through 2015  to underst and the effect of   integrated microfinance and health programs  .  Methods We search ed  PubMed , Scopus , Embase , EconLit , and Global Health data bases and source d bibliographies , identifying 964 articles exclusive of duplicates .  Title , abstract , and full text review yielded  35 articles .  Articles evaluated the effect of  intentionally  integrated microfinance and health programs  on client  outcomes . We rated the quality of evidence for each article . Results Most interventions  combined microfinance with health education  , which demonstrated  positive effects on health knowledge and behaviours  , though  not health status .  Among programs that  integrated microfinance  with other health components ( i.e. health micro-insurance , linkages to health providers , and access to health products ) , results were generally positive but mixed due to the smaller number and quality of studies . Interventions combining  multiple health components  in a given study demonstrated  positive effects  , though it was unclear which component was driving the effect . Most articles ( 57 % ) were moderate in quality . Discussion  Integrated microfinance and health education programs  were  effective  , though longer intervention periods are necessary to measure more complex pathways to health status . The effect of  microfinance  combined with other health components was less clear . Stronger r and omized research design s with multiple study arms are required to improve evidence and disentangle the effects of  multiple component microfinance and health interventions .  Few studies attempted to underst and changes in economic outcomes , limiting our underst and ing of the relationship between health and income effects."

"oBACKGROUND Impetigo is a common clinical problem seen in general practice . Uncertainty exists as to the most effective treatment , or indeed if treatment is necessary . AIM To determine the most effective treatment for impetigo in  a systemically well patient .  DESIGN OF STUDY Systematic review and meta- analysis . METHOD Data bases were search ed for relevant studies . The Cochrane highly sensitive r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) search string was employed and combined with the word  ' impetigo  ' as the MeSH term and keyword . The bibliographies of relevant articles were search ed for additional references . RCTs that were either double- or observer-blind , and involved  systemically well patients of any age in either primary or secondary care setting s  , were included .  Studies that selected patients on the basis of skin swab results were excluded  ,  as were studies that were not in English .   Cure or improvement of impetigo  reported at seven to 14 days from start of treatment was the primary outcome measure . Meta- analysis was performed on homogeneous studies . RESULTS  Three hundred and fifty-nine studies were identified , of which 16 met the inclusion criteria .  Meta- analysis demonstrated that topical  antibiotics  are more  effective  than  placebo  ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.69 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.49 to 4.86 ) . There is weak evidence for the  superiority  of  topical  antibiotics   over some oral antibiotics , such as  erythromycin  ( OR = 0.48 , 95 % CI = 0.23 to 1.00 ) . There is no significant difference between the  effects of mupirocin and fusidic acid  ( OR = 1.76 , 95 % CI = 0.77 to 4.03 ) .  This review found limited high- quality evidence to inform the treatment of impetigo . From that which is available , we would recommend the use of a topical  antibiotic  for a period of seven days in a  systemically well patient with limited disease .  Further research is needed on the role of  flucloxacillin  and  non-antibiotic treatments  for impetigo."
"nOBJECTIVE To systematic ally review the existing literature on  neurodevelopmental outcomes  in  children born after  medically assisted reproduction   compared with those of  children born after spontaneous conception .  DESIGN Systematic review . SETTING Not applicable . PATIENT(S )  Children born after  medically assisted reproduction  vs.  reference groups of spontaneously conceived children .   INTERVENTION(S ) Data were review ed from worldwide published articles , without restrictions as to publication year or language . A total of  80 studies included between 31 and 2,446,044 children .  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S )  Child neurodevelopmental outcomes categorized as cognitive , behavioral , emotional or psychomotor development , or diagnoses of mental disorders .  RESULT ( S ) For infants , studies on  psychomotor development  showed  no deficits  , but few investigated  cognitive or behavioral development .  Studies on toddlers generally reported  normal cognitive , behavioral , socio-emotional , and psychomotor development .  For children in middle childhood , development seems comparable in children born after  assisted reproduction  and controls , although fewer studies have been conducted with follow-up to this age . Very few studies have assessed  neurodevelopmental outcomes  among teens , and the results are inconclusive . Studies investigating the  risk of diagnoses of mental disorders  are generally large , with long follow-up , but the results are inconsistent .  ( S ) It may tentatively be concluded that the  neurodevelopment  of children born after   fertility treatment   is overall comparable to that in children born after spontaneous conception."
 Available studies show convincingly the health benefits of lifestyle changes in  CAD patients .  Effect estimates of combined  dietary changes  look promising . Future studies should confirm these findings and assess the contribution of the individual dietary factors.
"sThis aim of this review is to explore the current research related to   crosslinking agents  used on dentine .  A systematic search of publications in PubMed and Web of Science data bases was performed . Further retrieval was conducted using the search terms of specific names of crosslinkers . Review s ,  conference abstract  s ,  dissertation and theses  ,  non-English articles , studies of intrinsic crosslinking of dentine , studies of adhesives without specific crosslinker components , studies of  crosslinker  applications in other collagenous tissues or tooth-like structures and irrelevant studies were excluded  . Manual screening was conducted on the bibliographies of remaining papers to identify other relevant articles .  One hundred and one articles were included in this systematic review and  full texts were retrieved . Both synthetic and naturally derived  crosslinkers  have been found to exhibit significant effects in biomodification of dentine via their multiple interactions with the dentine matrix . A stable matrix network or a durable hybrid layer in dentine bonding could be achieved , where the dentine collagen fibrils show improved biochemical and biomechanical properties and enzymatic biodegradation is reduced . Although no crosslinkers have been tested in clinical trials , extensive research has been conducted in laboratory studies to investigate their potential applicability for  inhibition of demineralisation and /or promotion of remineralisation , caries prevention  as well as improvement of  bonding performance of adhesive systems .  Further studies are needed to develop the feasibility for clinical use , reduce side effects as well as explore mechanisms of action and long-term effectiveness."
 The evidence from trials for the use of benzodiazepines alone is not good . There were relatively little good data and most trials are too small to highlight differences in either positive or negative effects . Adding a benzodiazepine to other drugs does not seem to confer clear advantage and has potential for adding unnecessary adverse effects . Sole use of older antipsychotics unaccompanied by anticholinergic drugs seems difficult to justify . Much more high quality research is needed in this area.
" Despite the heterogeneity of the included studies , these data show that depression plays a significant role in knee pain , and that a biopsychosocial approach to the management of this condition is integral to optimising outcomes for knee pain."
"yBackground Meta-analyses of short-term studies indicate favorable effects of  higher protein vs. lower protein diets  on  health outcomes like adiposity or cardiovascular risk factors  , but their long-term effects are unknown . Methods Electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Trial Register ) were search ed up to August 2012 with no restriction to language or calendar date . A r and om effect meta- analysis was performed using the Software package by the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager 5.1 . Sensitivity analysis was performed for  RCTs with a Jadad Score ≥3 , and excluding type 2 diabetic subjects ( T2D ) .  Results  15 RCTs met all objectives  and  were included  in the present meta- analysis . No significant differences were  observed for weight , waist circumference , fat mass , blood lipids ( i.e. total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triacylglycerols ) , C-reactive protein , diastolic and systolic blood pressure , fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin  . In  contrast , improvements of fasting insulin  was significantly more pronounced  following high  protein diets as compared to the low protein counterparts ( weighted mean difference : -0.71 μIU/ml , 95 % CI -1.36 to -0.05 , p = 0.03 ) . Sensitivity analysis of high quality RCTs confirmed the data of the primary analyses , while exclusion of  studies  with  diabetic subjects  result ed in an additional  benefit of high-protein  diets with respect to a more marked  increase in HDL-cholesterol  . Conclusion According to the present meta- analysis of long-term  RCTs , high-protein  diets exerted neither specific beneficial nor detrimental effects on outcome  markers of obesity , cardiovascular disease or  glycemic control . Thus , it seems  premature  to  recommend high-protein diets  in the management of overweight and obesity."
"sAbstract Despite being first described two thous and years ago , the varicocele remains a controversial multifaceted disease process with numerous biological consequences including  infertility , hypogonadism , and chronic orchidalgia .  The underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and likely include hypoxia , oxidative stress , hyperthermia , anatomical aberrations , and genetics as primary components . Despite a high prevalence amongst asymptomatic fertile  men  , varicoceles paradoxically also represent the most common correctable cause for male infertility . In this systematic review we discuss the rich historical aspects of the varicocele and the contemporary data regarding its clinical manifestations . We performed a systematic literature review with the goal of comparing  outcomes and complication rates  of each of the major surgical approaches as they relate to  infertility  and  pain .  We performed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta- Analysis ( PRISMA ) -compliant systematic literature review for manuscripts focused on varicocele and its biological consequences . We identified  112 studies suitable for qualitative analysis and included 56 of these  for quantitative analysis , with an emphasis on  infertility and chronic pain outcomes .  Taken together , the clinical work to date suggests that the highest  fertility rates  and the lowest  complication rates  are associated with the  microsurgical subinguinal surgical approach to varicocelectomy .  In all , 26–40 % of  patients undergoing  varicocelectomy   will successfully achieve  short-term spontaneous pregnancy  , and up to 90 % of all patients undergoing   varicocelectomy   for  pain  will have improvement and /or resolution of their symptoms . Taken together , the data support an ongoing role for varicocelectomy in both of these clinical arenas."
"sA systematic review was conducted to evaluate whether  healthier dietary consumption   among children and adolescents  impacts  executive functioning .  PubMed , Education Re sources Information Center , PsychINFO and Thomson Reuters ' Web of Science data bases were search ed , and  studies of executive functioning among children or adolescents aged 6 - 18 years , which examined food quality ,  macronutrients  and /or  foods   , were included .  Study quality  was also assessed . In all ,  twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria .  Among the twelve studies examining food quality ( n 9 ) or macronutrient intakes ( n 4 ) , studies examining  longer-term diet  ( n 6 ) showed positive associations between healthier overall  diet  quality and  executive functioning  , whereas the studies examining the acute impact of diet ( n 6 ) were inconsistent but suggestive of improvements in  executive functioning  with better food quality . Among the ten studies examining foods , overall , there was a positive association between  healthier foods  ( e.g. whole grains , fish , fruits and /or vegetables ) and  executive function  , whereas less-healthy snack foods , sugar-sweetened beverages and red/processed meats were inversely associated with  executive functioning .  Taken together , evidence suggests a positive association between  healthy dietary consumption  and  executive functioning .  Additional studies examining the effects of healthier food consumption , as well as macronutrients , on  executive functioning  are warranted . These studies should ideally be conducted in controlled environments and use vali date d cognitive tests."
"sNeurofeedback  ( NF )  has gained increasing interest in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder ( ADHD ) .  Given learning principles underlie NF , lasting clinical treatment effects may be expected . This systematic review and meta- analysis addresses the sustainability of  neurofeedback and control treatment  effects by considering r and omized controlled studies that conducted follow-up ( FU ; 2–12 months ) assessment s  among children with ADHD .  PubMed and Scopus data bases were search ed through November 2017 . Within-group and between-group st and ardized mean  differences ( SMD ) of parent behavior ratings  were calculated and analyzed .  Ten studies met inclusion criteria ( NF : ten studies , N = 256 ; control : nine studies , N = 250 ) .  Within-group  NF effects on inattention  were of medium effect size ( ES ) ( SMD = 0.64 ) at post-treatment and increased to a large ES ( SMD = 0.80 ) at FU .  Regarding hyperactivity/impulsivity  , NF ES were medium at post-treatment ( SMD = 0.50 ) and FU ( SMD = 0.61 ) . Non-active control conditions yielded a small  significant ES on inattention  at post-treatment ( SMD = 0.28 ) but no significant ES at FU . Active treatments ( mainly  methylpheni  date ) , had  large ES for inattention  ( post : SMD = 1.08 ; FU : SMD = 1.06 ) and medium ES  for hyperactivity/impulsivity  ( post : SMD = 0.74 ; FU : SMD = 0.67 ) . Between-group analyses also revealed an advantage of NF over non-active  controls [ inattention  ( post : SMD = 0.38 ; FU : SMD = 0.57  ) ; hyperactivity – impulsivity  ( post : SMD = 0.25 ; FU : SMD = 0.39 ) ] , and favored active controls  for inattention  only at pre-post ( SMD = − 0.44 ) . Compared  to non-active control treatments ,  NF appears to have more durable  treatment effects  , for at least 6 months following treatment . More studies are needed for a properly powered comparison of follow-up effects between NF and active treatments and to further control for non-specific effects."
"sOBJECTIVE Pathomechanisms of  sedentary  behaviour  ( SB )  are unclear . We conducted a systematic review to investigate the associations between SB and various biomarkers  in older adults .  METHODS Electronic data bases were search ed ( MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , AMED ) up to July 2015 to identify studies with objective or subjective measures of  SB  ,  sample size ≥50 , mean age ≥60years and accelerometer wear time ≥3days .  Method ological quality was appraised with the CASP tool . The protocol was pre-specified ( PROSPERO CRD42015023731 ) . RESULTS  12701 abstract s were retrieved , 275 full text articles further explored , from which 249 were excluded .  In the final sample ( 26 articles ) a total of 63 biomarkers were detected . Most investigated markers were  : body mass index  (  BMI  , n=15 )  , waist circumference  ( WC , n=15 ) ,  blood pressure  ( n=11 ) ,  triglycerides  ( n=12 ) and  high density lipoprotein  ( HDL , n=15 ) . Some  inflammation markers  were identified such  as interleukin-6 , C-reactive protein or tumor necrosis factor alpha  . There was a lack of renal  , muscle  or  bone  biomarkers . R and omized controlled trials found a positive correlation  for SB with BMI , neck circumference , fat mass , HbA1C , cholesterol and insulin levels  , cohort studies additionally  for WC , leptin , C-peptide , ApoA1 and Low density lipoprotein  and a negative correlation for HDL .  Most studied biomarkers associated  with SB  were of cardiovascular or metabolic origin . There is a suggestion of a negative impact of SB on biomarkers but still a paucity of high quality investigations exist . Longitudinal studies with objective ly measured SB are needed to further eluci date the pathophysiological pathways and possible associations of unexplored biomarkers."

"hSTUDY DESIGN Best evidence synthesis . OBJECTIVE To critically appraise and synthesize the literature on assessment of   neck pain .   SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA The published literature on assessment of  neck pain  is large and of variable quality . There have been no prior systematic review s of this literature . METHODS The Bone and Joint Decade 2000 - 2010 Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders conducted a critical review of the literature ( published 1980 - 2006 ) on  assessment tools  and  screening protocol s  for  traumatic and nontraumatic neck pain .  RESULTS We found  359 articles on  assessment  of  neck pain .   After critical review , 95 ( 35 % ) were judged scientifically admissible .  Screening protocol  s have high predictive values to detect cervical spine fracture in  alert , low-risk patients seeking emergency care after blunt neck trauma .   Computerized tomography ( CT ) scans  had better validity ( in adults and elderly ) than  radiographs  in assessing  high-risk and /or multi-injured blunt trauma neck patients .  In the absence of serious pathology , clinical physical examinations are more predictive at excluding than confirming structural lesions causing neurologic compression . One exception is the manual provocation test for cervical radiculopathy , which has high positive predictive value . There was no evidence that specific  MRI findings  are associated with neck pain , cervicogenic headache , or whiplash exposure . No evidence supports using  cervical provocative discography , anesthetic facet , or medial branch blocks  in evaluating  neck pain .  Reliable and valid self-report question naires are useful in assessing  pain , function , disability , and psychosocial status  in  individuals with neck pain .   The scientific evidence supports  screening protocol  s in emergency care for low-risk patients ; and  CT-scans  for  high-risk patients with blunt trauma to the neck  . In nonemergency neck pain without radiculopathy , the validity of most commonly used objective tests is lacking . There is support for subjective self-report assessment in monitoring patients ' course , response to treatment , and in clinical research."

"sIn observational studies ,  vegetarians  generally have lower  body weights  compared with omnivores . However ,  weight changes  that occur when  vegetarian diets  are prescribed have not been well quantified . We estimated the effect on  body weight  when  vegetarian diets  are prescribed . We search ed PubMed , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles through December 31 , 2013 . Additional articles were identified from reference lists . We included  intervention trials in which participants were adults , interventions  included vegetarian diets  of ≥4 weeks ' duration without energy intake limitations , and effects on  body weight  were reported  . Two investigators independently extracted data using predetermined fields .  Estimates of body weight change  , comparing intervention groups to untreated control groups , were derived using a r and om effects model to estimate the weighted mean difference . To quantify effects on  body  weight of baseline weight , sex , age , study duration , study goals , type of diet , and study authors hip , additional analyses examined within-group changes for all studies reporting variance data . We identified  15 trials ( 17 intervention groups )  , of which  4  included  untreated controls .  Prescription  of vegetarian diets  was associated  with a mean weight change  of -3.4 kg ( 95 % CI -4.4 to -2.4 ; P<0.001 ) in an intention-to-treat analysis and -4.6 kg ( 95 % CI -5.4 to -3.8 ; P<0.001 ) in a completer analysis ( omitting missing post-intervention values ) .  Greater weight loss  was reported in studies with higher baseline weights , smaller proportions of female participants , older participants , or longer duration s , and in studies in which weight loss was a goal . Using baseline data for missing values , I(2 ) equaled 52.3 ( P=0.10 ) , indicating moderate heterogeneity . When missing data were omitted , I(2 ) equaled 0 ( P=0.65 ) , indicating low heterogeneity . Studies are relatively few , with variable quality . The  prescription of vegetarian diets   reduces mean body weight  , suggesting potential value for prevention and management of weight-related conditions."
" This review suggests that both benzodiazepines work , but that midazolam has a faster onset and thereby reduces the  risk of exposure to violence .  Both benzodiazepines have the potential to cause  respiratory depression  , probably  midazolam  more so than  lorazepam  , and we would question the use of this group of drugs outside of those services fully confident of observing for and managing the consequences of  respiratory distress .  Most evidence , however , exists for the  haloperidol  plus  promethazine  mix , with currently more  than 400 people r and omised  to the combination . The  onset of action  is  swift  and faster than  lorazepam .  The combination also seems  safe  with no clear  longer term consequences .  We would expect policy makers recommending other drug managements to have equally compelling evidence to support their guidance and hope that this would not be founded in conjecture or consensus , which may be more difficult to defend than evidence from high quality studies."

"dThis systematic  review  and meta- analysis examined the associations between  obesity and  puberty  timing  based on scientific evidence . Eight electronic data bases were search ed up to February 2017 for eligible studies , and two review ers screened the articles and extracted the data independently . A total of  11 cohort studies with 4841 subjects met the inclusion criteria .  Compared with the group of normal-weight girls , the obese group had more  girls with menarche  ( RR : 1.87 , 95 % CI : 1.59 - 2.19 , 2 studies ) .  The number of girls with early puberty  was significantly higher in the obese group than the normal weight group ( RR : 2.44 , 95 % CI : 1.32 - 4.52 , 5 studies ) . However , no differences were detected  between girls who were obese or normal weight at age of menarche  ( WMD : -0.53 years , 95 % CI : -1.24 - 0.19 , 2 studies ) . There is no consistent result in the  relationship between obesity and timing of pubertal onset  in boys . Obesity may contribute to  early onset of puberty  in girls , while in boys , there is insufficient data . Given the limited number of  cohort studies  included in this meta- analysis , high- quality studies with strong markers of puberty onset , as well as st and ardized criteria for defining obesity are needed."
"IStudies related to  vitamin  D deficiency  and lower respiratory tract infections ( LRTI ) in children  have inconsistent findings . The objective of this systematic review was to assess the prevalence of  vitamin D  deficiency in  children with LRTI  , and to evaluate the correlation between vitamin D levels and the incidence and severity of LRTI . A total of  12 studies enrolling 2279 participants  were included in our analysis .  Children with LRTI  were found to have significantly  lower mean vitamin D levels  as compared to controls There was likewise a correlation  between vitamin D levels and incidence and severity of LRTI .

"sThe aim of this network meta- analysis ( NMA ) is to compare the effects of different  oils/solid fats  on  blood  lipids  .  Literature search es were performed until March 2018 . Inclusion criteria were as follows :  i ) r and omized trial ( 3 weeks study length )  comparing at least two of the  following oils/solid fats : safflower , sunflower , rapeseed , hempseed , flaxseed , corn , olive , soybean , palm , and coconut oil , and lard , beef-fat , and butter ;  ii ) outcomes  LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , HDL-cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , and triacylglycerols ( TGs )  . A r and om dose-response ( per 10 % isocaloric exchange ) NMA was performed and  surface under the cumulative ranking curve (  SUCRA ) was estimated .  Fifty-four trials were included in  the NMA .  Safflower oil  had the  highest SUCRA value for LDL-C  ( 82 % ) and TC ( 90 % ) , followed by  rapeseed oil  ( 76 % for LDL-C , 85 % for TC ) ; whereas ,  palm oil  ( 74 % ) had the  highest SUCRA value for TG  , and coconut oil ( 88 % )  for HDL-C.   Safflower , sunflower , rapeseed , flaxseed , corn , olive , soybean , palm , and coconut oil  as well  beef fat  were more  effective in reducing LDL-C  ( -0.42 to -0.23 mmol/l ) as compared with butter . Despite limitations in these data , our NMA findings are in line with existing evidence on the metabolic effects of fat and support current recommendations to replace high saturated-fat food with unsaturated oils."

"dBackground  Gastric cancer  is a major health problem , and frailty and sarcopenia will affect the postoperative outcomes in  older people .  However , there is still no systematic review to determine the role of frailty and sarcopenia in predicting postoperative outcomes among  older patients with gastric cancer who undergo gastrectomy surgery .  Methods We search ed Embase , Medline through the Ovid interface and PubMed websites to identify potential studies . All the search strategies were run on August 24 , 2016 . We search ed the Google website for unpublished studies on June 1 , 2017 . The data related to the endpoints of gastrectomy surgery were extracted .  Odds ratios (  ORs ) and their 95  % confidence intervals  (  CIs  ) were pooled to estimate the association between sarcopenia and adverse postoperative outcomes by using Stata version 11.0 . PRISMA guidelines for systematic review s were followed . Results  After screening 500 records , we identified eight studies , including  three  prospect  i  ve  cohort studies and  five retrospective  cohort studies . Only one study described  frailty  , and the remaining seven studies described  sarcopenia  . Frailty was statistically significant for  predicting hospital mortality  ( OR 3.96 ; 95 % CI : 1.12–14.09 , P = 0.03 ) .  Sarcopenia  was also associated  with postoperative outcomes  ( pooled OR 3.12 ; 95 % CI : 2.23–4.37 ) . No significant heterogeneity was observed across these pooled studies ( Chi2 = 3.10 , I2 = 0 % , P = 0.685 ) . ConclusionS arcopenia and frailty seem to have significant adverse impacts on the occurrence of  postoperative  outcomes . Well- design ed prospect i ve cohort studies focusing on frailty and quality of life with a sufficient sample are needed."

"sThe aim of this systematic review was to establish whether the clinical debonding  ( failure  ) rates of  orthodontic brackets bonded either with  resin-modified glass ionomer ( RM-GIC )  or  with composite resin adhesive   are the same .  Five data bases  were search ed  for articles up to 18 November 2010 .  Inclusion criteria were  titles/ abstract  s  relevant  to the review question  and two or more arm clinical trial .  Exclusion criteria were the following : no  computable data  recorded and  subjects of both groups  not followed up in the same way . From the accepted trials , data sets were analysed concerning clinical precision and internal validity .  Eleven trials were accepted .  From these , 15 dichotomous data sets were extracted .  Relative risk  with 95 % confidence interval of nine data sets showed  no statistically significant differences  in outcome between the treatment and control group after 6 months–1.32 years . Five showed a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05 ) , favouring  resin composite bonding  after 12 and 18 months . One favoured  RM-GIC  after 10 months . Meta- analysis found no difference in  the failure rate  between the two treatment groups after 12 months ( RR , 1.11 ; 95 % CI , 0.87–1.42 ; p = 0.40 ) and found in favour of composite resin adhesive after > 14 months ( RR , 2.25 ; 95 % CI , 1.60–3.17 ; p < 0.00001 ) . All trials had poor  internal validity  due to selection and detection/performance bias risk . The current evidence suggests no difference between the types of material s after 12 months but favours  composite resin adhesives  after a > 14-month period . However , its risk of selection and detection/performance bias are high , and all results need to be regarded with caution . Further high quality r and omised control trials addressing this topic are needed . The clinical relevance of this study is that  RM-GIC  may have the same  clinical debonding ( failure ) rate  as  composite resin adhesives  after 1 year when used for bonding of orthodontic brackets."
" There is great heterogeneity in the expression of results of the treatments for  weight loss ;  the diet is one of the least used tools ; the analysis of clinical trials of intervention reflects a high quality in  subjects older than 18 years  , highlighting the lack of this type of research lines in  children under 18 years  . Therefore , it should st and ardize the magnitudes of expression of the success of these treatments and increase the lines of research on this topic."

">The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different dietary approaches on  low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , and triglyceride ( TG ) levels  in  patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2D )  by applying network meta- analysis ( NMA ) . Systematic electronic and h and search es were conducted until January 2018 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs  ) with an intervention period of ≥ 12 weeks  ,  focussing on adults with T2D , and  comparing dietary  approaches  regarding  LDL , HDL or TGs  , were included . For each outcome measure , r and om effects NMA was performed in order to determine the effect of each dietary approach compared to every other dietary intervention  . Mean differences ( MDs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs )  were calculated , and for the ranking , the surface under the cumulative ranking curves ( SUCRA ) was determined . Additionally , the  credibility  of evidence was evaluated .  52 RCTs ( 44 for LDL , 48 for HDL and 52 for TGs )  comparing nine dietary approaches  ( low fat , vegetarian , Mediterranean , high protein  ,  moderate  carbohydrate ,  low  carbohydrate , control , low glycaemic index/glycaemic load and Palaeolithic diet )  enrolling 5360 T2D patients were included .  The vegetarian diet most effectively  reduced LDL levels  [ MD ( 95 % CI ) : − 0.33 ( − 0.55 , − 0.12 ) mmol/L ; compared to the control diet ] . The Mediterranean diet beneficially  raised HDL  [ MD ( 95 % CI ) : 0.09 ( 0.04 , 0.15 ) mmol/L ]  and decreased TG levels  [ MD ( 95 % CI ) : − 0.41 ( − 0.72 , − 0.10 ) mmol/L ] compared to the control diet . The Mediterranean diet was the most effective dietary approach to  manage diabetic dyslipidaemia  altogether ( SUCRA : 79 % ) . The overall findings are mainly limited by  low credibility of evidence ."

This includes prioritization of the existing vali date d outcome measures in terms of their usefulness and relevance to the measurement and valuation of patient benefits from a CGS.
"mAIM To synthesize the effects of  theory-based self-management educational interventions  on  patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM )  in r and omized controlled trials . BACKGROUND Type 2 diabetes is a common chronic disease causing complications that put a heavy burden on society and reduce the quality of life of patients . Good self-management of diabetes can prevent complications and improve the quality of life of  T2DM patients .  DESIGN Systematic review with meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials following Cochrane methods . DATA RE SOURCES A literature search was carried out in the MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PSYCINFO , and Web of Science data bases ( 1980-April 2015 ) . REVIEW METHODS The risk of bias of these eligible studies was assessed independently by two authors using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool . The Publication bias of the main outcomes was examined . Statistical heterogeneity and r and om-effects model were used for meta- analysis . RESULTS  Twenty studies with 5802 participants met the inclusion criteria .  The interventions in the studies were based on one or more theories which mostly belong to mid-range theories . The pooled main outcomes by r and om-effects model showed significant  improvements in HbA1c , self-efficacy , and diabetes knowledge , but not in BMI .  As for  quality of life  , no conclusions can be drawn as the pooled outcome became the opposite with reduced heterogeneity after one study was excluded . No significant publication bias was found in the main outcomes .  To get  theory-based  interventions to produce more effects , the role of patients should be more involved and stronger and the education team should be trained beyond the primary preparation for the self-management education program."
" The diversity of interventions and outcomes addressed across studies and differences in setting s , population s and comparisons made it difficult to summarise results across studies . Cap and co-payment polices may reduce the  use of medicines  and reduce  medicine expenditures  for health insurers . However , they may also reduce the  use of life-sustaining medicines  or  medicines  that are important in treating chronic , including symptomatic , conditions and , consequently , could increase the  use of healthcare services .   Fixed co-payment with a ceiling  and  tiered fixed co-payment  may be less likely to reduce the  use of essential medicines  or to increase the use of healthcare services."
"sThis meta- analysis of the r and omized controlled trials was performed to assess effects of   carnitine supplementation   on  serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) levels .  A comprehensive literature search of PubMed , Cochrane ’s library , Web of Science , Scopus , and Embase was performed up to May 2018 .  From a total of 2012 articles identified initially , only 17 articles were included in the final meta- analysis  to evaluate the effects of  carnitine supplementation  on  serum levels of ALT and AST enzymes .  R and om effects model meta- analysis showed  that carnitine supplementation  led to  reduction in serum ALT  ( weighted mean difference [ WMD ] − 10.25 IU/L ; 95 % CI = − 15.73 , − 4.77 ; p < 0.001 )  and AST levels  ( WMD − 7.85 IU/L ; 95 % CI = − 11.85 , − 3.86 ; p < 0.001 ) . The results of subgroup analysis showed  that carnitine  could  reduce serum AST levels  at dosages equal to 2000 mg/day ( p = 0.014 ) or more than 2000 mg/day ( p < 0.001 ) .  However , carnitine supplementation  at dosages of ≤ 1000 mg/day ( p = 0.035 ) or equal to 2000 mg/day ( p = 0.013 ) result ed in  significant reduction in ALT level  , while doses more than 2000 mg/day did not  change  ALT   significantly  . Carnitine  exerts its reducing effect  on serum ALT and AST levels  only when these aminotransferases are raised or when the duration of supplementation lasts at least 3 months . Results of the current meta- analysis showed  that carnitine supplementation  can  decrease serum AST and ALT levels  significantly , especially when supplementation lasts 3 months or more in patients with elevated serum aminotransferase levels."
" No study to date has reported the  reliability of trigger point diagnosis  according to the currently proposed criteria . On the basis of the limited number of studies available , and significant problems with their design , reporting , statistical integrity , and clinical applicability ,  physical examination  can not currently be recommended as a reliable test for the diagnosis of trigger points . The  reliability  of trigger point diagnosis needs to be further investigated with studies of high quality that use current diagnostic criteria in clinical ly relevant patients."

 Six  dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers  studied in this review  lowered blood pressure  by a relatively similar amount each hour over the course of 24 hours . The benefits and harms of this pattern of blood pressure lowering are unknown . Further trials are needed with accurate recording of time of drug intake and with reporting of st and ard deviation of  blood pressure  at each hour . We did not attempt to assess adverse effects in this review due to the lack of reporting and the short duration of follow-up.

We recommend use of  EQ-5D  alongside  children-specific quality of life measures  and disease-specific measures . Research ers are encouraged to undertake method ological and philosophical analyses to better underst and and improve evidence as to how adults who make decisions about re source allocation can best take account of children in decision making."
"sThis systematic review summarizes the outcome reporting st and ards in  Dupuytren ’s disease treatment research .  A search of Ovid Medline , Ovid Embase , and CINAHL was conducted .  R and omized controlled trials , cohort studies , and case series published between 1997 and 2017 , investigating treatment of Dupuytren ’s disease with  fasciectomy , fasciotomy , or collagenase  , were eligible for inclusion .   Range of motion  was the most commonly reported outcome , appearing in 77 % of included studies . Outcomes , such as  range of motion , recurrence , and clinical success  , were frequently defined , however many different definitions were used . We identified 37 unique measurement methods for  range of motion  , 28 for  recurrence  , and 25 for  clinical success .  Most outcomes were assessed at multiple time points , and only a few studies reported results according to established clinical significance thresholds . Development of a core outcome set will help st and ardize outcome reporting , and ensure future research in this field is relevant , interpretable , and amenable to systematic review and /or meta- analysis."
"sSkeletal muscle atrophy is a major systemic impairment in chronic diseases . Yet its determinants have been hard to identify because a clear research definition has not been agreed upon . The reduction in muscle fiber cross-sectional area ( CSA ) is a widely acknowledged marker of muscle atrophy , but no reference values for the muscle fiber CSA at the age of the onset of chronic disease have ever been published . Thus , we aim ed to systematic ally review the studies providing  data  on  fiber CSA and fiber type proportion  in  the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps  of   healthy subjects  ( age > 40 yr )  and then to pool and analyze the data from the selected studies to determine reference values for  fiber CSA .  We followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) and  identified 19 studies , including 423 subjects that matched the inclusion criteria .  On the basis of fiber type and gender , the  mean fiber CSA  and the  lower  limits of  normal  ( LLNs ) were ( % type I*60 ) + 1,743 μm(2 ) and ( % type I*60 ) - 718 μm(2 ) , respectively , for men ; and ( % type I*70 ) + 139 μm(2 ) and ( % type I*70 ) - 1,485 μm(2 ) , respectively , for women . There was no significant heterogeneity among subgroups of fiber type and gender .  The pooled type I fiber proportion  was 50.3 % ( LLN = 32.9 % ) . In multivariate  analysis , fiber CSA  was significantly correlated  with Vo2  peak ( r = 190.92 ; P = 0.03  ) , and type I fiber proportion  was correlated with age ( r = -0.024 ; P = 0.005 ) ,  body  mass index ( r = 0.096 ; P = 0.005 ) , and Vo2 peak ( r = -0.053 ; P = 0.005 ) . Our meta analysis of a homogeneous set of studies is the first to provide valuable LLNs for  fiber CSA  according to fiber type and gender . This analysis will be improved by prospect i ve assessment in well-characterized healthy subjects."
"yOBJECTIVES  Older head and neck cancer patients  are at increased risk for adverse health outcomes , but little is known about which  geriatric assessment  associates with poor outcome . The aim is to study the association of functional or cognitive impairment , social environment and frailty with adverse health outcomes in  patients with head and neck cancer .  METHODS  Four  libraries were search ed for studies reporting on an association of functional or cognitive impairment , social environment and frailty with adverse outcomes in  head and neck cancer patients .  RESULTS Of  4158 identified citations , 31 articles were included . The mean age was ⩾60years  in twelve studies ( 39 % ) . Geriatric conditions were prevalent : between 40 and  50 %  of  the included participants were functional impaired  , around 50  % had depressive symptoms  , and  around 40 % did not have a partner   . Functional impairment  was assessed in 18 studies , two studies reported on a cognitive test , eight studies  examined mood and social status  was depicted by 14 studies . None of the included studies  addressed frailty  or objective  ly measured physical capacity such as h and grip strength , gait speed or balance tests  . In 64 % of the reported associations , a decline  in functional or cognitive impairment , mood or social environment  was associated with adverse outcomes .   Functional and cognitive impairment , depressive symptoms and social isolation  are highly prevalent in  head and neck cancer patients  and associate with high risk of adverse health outcomes . In the future , these measurements may guide decision-making and customize treatments , but more research is needed to further improve and firmly establish clinical usability."
" High- quality evidence shows that  exercise  programmes provided important benefit compared with  placebo  or  usual care  in improving both  pain-free and maximum walking distance  in  people with leg pain from IC who were considered to be fit for  exercise intervention  .   Exercise  did not improve  ABI  , and we found no evidence of an effect of  exercise  on  amputation or mortality .   Exercise  may improve  quality of life  when compared with  placebo or usual care .  As time has progressed , the trials undertaken have begun to include  exercise  versus  exercise  or other modalities ; therefore we can include fewer of the new trials in this up date."
"sPURPOSE To up date American Society of Hematology/American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for use of  erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs )  in  patients with cancer .  METHODS An Up date Committee review ed data  published between January 2007 and January 2010 .  MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were search ed . RESULTS The literature search yielded one new  individual patient data analysis  and four literature -based meta-analyses , two systematic review s , and 13 publications reporting new results from r and omized controlled trials not included in prior or new review s. RECOMMENDATIONS For  patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy who have a hemoglobin ( Hb ) level less than 10 g/dL  , the Up date Committee recommends that clinicians discuss potential harms ( eg ,  thromboembolism , shorter survival )  and benefits ( eg , decreased transfusions ) of  ESAs  and compare these with potential harms ( eg ,  serious infections , immune-mediated adverse reactions )  and benefits ( eg ,  rapid Hb improvement  ) of  RBC  transfusions . Individual preferences for assumed risk should contribute to shared decisions on managing chemotherapy-induced anemia . The Committee caution s against  ESA  use under other circumstances . If used ,  ESAs  should be administered at the lowest dose possible and should increase Hb to the lowest concentration possible to avoid transfusions . Available evidence does not identify  Hb levels  ≥  10 g/dL  either as thresholds for initiating treatment or as targets for  ESA  therapy . Starting doses and dose modifications after response or nonresponse should follow US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling .  ESAs  should be discontinued after 6 to 8 weeks in nonresponders .  ESAs  should be avoided in  patients with cancer not receiving concurrent chemotherapy  , except for those with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes . Caution should be exercised when using  ESAs  with chemotherapeutic agents in diseases associated with increased  risk of thromboembolic complications  . Table 1 lists detailed recommendations."
"yObjectives To evaluate whether the application of  mechanical bowel preparation ( MBP )  before  colorectal  surgery reduces the risk of developing infectious complications  in children .  Study design In this systematic review and meta‐ analysis , PubMed , Embase , and the Cochrane Library were systematic ally search ed to identify  all articles comparing pediatric patients  receiving MBP  with pediatric patients  not receiving MBP  before colorectal surgery .  Results are presented with weighted risk differences based on the number of events and sample size per study . Results  Six original studies were included comparing  MBP  ( n = 810 ) and  no MBP  ( n = 1167 )  .  The overall risk of developing infectious complications  was 10.1 % in patients  with MBP  , compared with 9.1 % in patients  without  MBP , result ing in a nonsignificant risk difference of −0.03 % ( 95 % CI , −0.09 % to 0.03 % ) .  Concerning the number of wound infections and anastomotic leaks  , we found nonsignificant risk differences of −0.03 % ( 95 % CI , −0.08 % to 0.02 % ) and 0.01 % ( 95 % CI , −0.01 % to 0.02 % ) , respectively . Conclusion Based on the current literature , there is insufficient evidence to indicate that the use  of MBP  leads to a significant difference in  the risk of developing infectious complications  in pediatric colorectal surgery."

 Antihypertensive drugs used to treat  predominantly healthy adults aged 18 to 59 years with mild to moderate primary hypertension  have a small absolute effect to reduce  cardiovascular mortality and morbidity  primarily due to reduction in  cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity . All-cause mortality and coronary heart disease  were not reduced . There is lack of good evidence on withdrawal due to  adverse events .  Future trials in this age group should be at least 10 years in duration and should compare different first-line drug classes and strategies.

"wSince August  2009  ,  members of the Primary Care Dentistry Research Forum ( www.dentistry research .org )  have taken part in an online vote to identify questions in day-to-day practice that they felt most needed to be answered with conclusive research . The question that receives the most votes each month forms the subject of a critical appraisal of the relevant literature . Each month a new round of voting takes place to decide which further questions will be review ed .  Dental practitioners and dental care professionals  are encouraged to take part in the voting and su bmi t their own questions to be included in the vote by joining the website . The paper below details a summary of the findings of the ninth critical appraisal . In order to address the question raised by dentistry research forum , first a search was conducted for systematic review s on the topic . There was one systematic review retrieved comparing   bonded  amalgam  restorations  versus non-bonded amalgam restorations .  However , there was no other systematic review identified assessing the  effectiveness  of  dental liners under amalgam restorations  in general . Therefore , a search was conducted for any r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) comparing use of a  lining under  amalgam  restorations  versus  no lining  or  RCTs  comparing differing  lining material  s  under  amalgam   against each other . There were eight relevant RCTs identified . Due to the low quality , small sample sizes or lack of adequate reporting of the outcome data , the evidence is inadequate to cl aim or refute a difference in  postoperative sensitivity  between different dental liners . Further well-conducted RCTs are needed to answer this question . These RCTs would be preferably included and synthesis ed in a systematic review."
  Vitamin D  alone is unlikely to prevent  fractures  in the doses and formulations tested so far in  older people .  Supplements of  vitamin D and calcium  may prevent  hip  or any type  of fracture .  There was a small but significant increase in  gastrointestinal symptoms and renal disease  associated with  vitamin D and calcium .  This review found that there was no increased  risk of death  from taking calcium and vitamin.
"sEarly experiences in  physical activity ( PA )  are important to shape healthy movement behaviours long-term ; as such , it is critical that  PA  is promoted from infancy , and that detrimental behaviours ( e.g. , prolonged  sedentary time  [  ST  ] ) are minimized . The purpose of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to examine  infants ’ and toddlers ’  movement behaviours across daytime hours .  Seven online data bases  were search ed for terms related to  infants ( < 12 months ) , toddlers ( 12–35.9 months ) ,  PA ,  ST   , and   accelerometry .   Two independent review ers examined 4873 articles for peer- review ed original research  ,  published in English  , that assessed  infants ’  ( counts/min ) and /or toddlers  ’ PA or ST ( min/day )  using  accelerometry  across daytime hours .  Infants ’ mean PA level  ( counts/min ) was averaged across studies , and ranges were produced . Estimates of toddlers ’ movement behaviours were aggregated meta-analytically to produce average daily rates , and  accelerometer placement , cut-point validity , device type  , and  epoch  length were tested as a moderating variables .  Twenty-four studies from 16 countries ( published 2011–2019 ) , representing 3699 participants , were included in the systematic review  . Five studies reported on  infants ’ PA  , which ranged from 78.2 to 2580.5 cpm . Across 20 studies ,  toddlers ’ total PA , light PA , moderate-to vigorous-intensity PA , and ST  ranged from 72.9 to 636.5 , 48.5 to 582.4 , 6.5 to 89.9 , and 172.7 to 545.0 min/day , respectively . After taking into account  accelerometer placement , cut-point validity , device type , and epoch length  , we found that toddlers engaged in 246.19 min/day ( SE = 28.50 ; 95 % CI : 190.34 , 302.04 ) of  total PA  , 194.10 min/day ( SE = 28.76 ; 95 % CI : 137.73 , 250.47 ) of  light PA  , and 60.16 min/day ( SE = 5.88 ; 95 % CI : 48.64 , 71.69 )  of moderate-to vigorous-intensity PA  . Toddlers engaged in 337.04 min/day ( SE = 32.67 ; 95 % CI : 273.01 , 401.07 ) of  ST  . With limited studies conducted in infants ( n = 5 ) , PA estimates are inconclusive and largely heterogeneous . Overall ,  toddlers  tend to exceed the total PA recommendation of 180 min/day ; however , very little of this time is spent at higher movement intensities . Even with high PA rates , toddlers still engage in substantial  ST .  More consistent and valid measurement protocol s are needed to improve comparability across studies."
"sGroup  sports interventions  have been developed to improve health-related physical fitness of  overweight/obese youth .  However , its benefits are not systematic ally documented . This study synthesizes the evidence about the effects of  group sports  on health-related physical fitness of  overweight/obese youth .  Pubmed , Web of Knowledge , Scopus , Medline , CINAHL , SportD iscus , and Academic Search Complete were search ed in February 2016 . Studies assessing the effects of   group sports   on   body composition , cardiorespiratory endurance , muscle strength ,  flexibility  , and neuromotor fitness  of overweight/obese youth ( aged < 18 years ) were included .   Effect sizes (  ES ) were calculated with Cohen 's d and its 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) . Improvements were found in ( i )  body composition - percentage of fat body mass  ( pooled ES = 0.67 ; 95 % CI = 0.24 - 1.10 ) and  waist circumference  ( ES = 0.69 ; P = 0.004 ) ; ( ii )  cardiorespiratory endurance - peak oxygen consumption  ( pooled ES = 0.53 ; 95 % CI = 0.13 - 0.92 ) and (  iii ) muscle strength - h and grip strength  ( ES = 0.72 ; P = 0.003 ) . No significant effects were found for  body mass index  ( pooled ES = 0.27 ; 95 % CI = -0.14 to 0.69 ) ,  percentage of lean body mass  ( ES = 0.01 ; P > 0.05 ) ,  maximal power output  ( ES from 0 to 0.06 ; P > 0.05 ) ,  sit- and -reach test  ( pooled ES = 0.26 ; 95 % CI = -0.16 to 0.68 ) and  agility test  ( ES = 0 ; P = 0.48 ) .  Group  sports improve  body composition , cardiorespiratory endurance , and h and grip strength  of  overweight/obese youth  .  Flexibility and neuromotor fitness  do not seem to change following group sports."
" Until better evidence is available , the choice of antihypertensive should depend on the experience and familiarity of an individual clinician with a particular drug , and on what is known about adverse maternal and fetal side-effects  .

"DBackground Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) is characterised by significant impairment in social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviour or interest . Intervention during early childhood could decrease ASD symptoms . We aim ed to identify the most effective intervention based on  cognitive , developmental , and behavioural approaches  and the factors that impact the effectiveness of the intervention . Methods We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of existing interventions for  ASD in preschool-aged children .  Electronic data bases were search ed for related articles with r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) design s published between  2001 to 2015  . Outcome measures were  communication , behavioural and cognitive skills , reported as st and ardised mean differences ( SMD )  compared to a control group . A R and om-effects model was utilised to calculate the pooled estimate effect . Between- study variability was also assessed . The registering number of this study is CRD42017035354 . Findings Out of the  initial 5174 studies that were identified , there were 14 RCTs ( 746 children ) that were included in the final systematic review and meta- analysis .  Pooled estimate effect provided by r and om-effects model was 0.23 ( 95 % confidence interval , CI [ 0.08 - 0.37 ] ) with no between- study heterogeneity ( I2 = 0.00 % , p = 0.0018 ) . Three studies of  music therapy  interventions provided the  greatest outcome effects with  a  shorter duration and lower intensity . SMD   for music therapies  ranged from 0.40 to 0.62 with 95 % CI [ 0.22 to 1.85 ] . The  quality of the health care provider , the duration , and the intensity of intervention  played an important role in the effectiveness of the intervention . Interpretation  Music therapy  appears to be an effective tool for improving  social interaction  in  preschool-aged children with ASD .  However , more evidence -based trials are required to further vali date the effectiveness of  music therapy  in ASD."

"eModerate-to-vigorous-intensity   physical activity ( MVPA )   is important for childhood obesity prevention and treatment , yet declines with age . Timing and magnitude of the decline in MVPA in  children and adolescents  are unclear but important for informing effective obesity intervention development . This systematic review aim ed to determine and compare the year-to-year changes in  MVPA  among  children and adolescents .  Longitudinal studies were identified by search ing 10 relevant data bases up to December 2018 .  Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported   accelerometer-assessed MVPA   ( min day-1 ) separately for boys and girls and had follow-up duration of at least 1 year . After screening 9,232 studies , 52 were included representing 22,091 aged 3 to 18 year olds ( boys=8,857 ; girls=13,234 ) .  Pooled- analysis of the relative  change in MVPA  per year showed a decline of -3.4 % ( 95 % CI , -5.9 to -0.9 ) in boys and -5.3 % ( 95 % CI , -7.6 to -3.1 ) in girls , across all age groups . There were notable declines  in MVPA  at age 9 for both boys ( -7.8 % , 95 % CI , -11.2 to -4.4 ) and girls ( -10.2 % , 95 % CI , -14.2 to -6.3 ) . The relative  decline in MVPA  affects both sexes from an early age ; however , it is greater among girls .  Interventions to promote  MVPA   should start before adolescence."
"tAIMS To identify different types of  models  used in economic evaluations of  smoking cessation  , analyse the quality of the included models examining their attributes and ascertain their transferability to a new context . METHODS A systematic review of the literature on the  economic evaluation  of  smoking cessation interventions published between 1996 and April 2015  , identified via Medline , EMBASE , National Health Service ( NHS ) Economic Evaluation Data base ( NHS EED ) , Health Technology Assessment ( HTA ) . The checklist-based quality of the included studies and transferability scores was based on the European Network of Health Economic Evaluation Data bases ( EURONHEED ) criteria .  Studies that were not in smoking cessation  ,  not original research  ,  not a model-based economic evaluation  ,  that did not consider adult population and not from a high-income country  were excluded . FINDINGS Among the  64 economic evaluations  included in the review , the state-transition Markov model was the most frequently used method ( n = 30/64 ) , with  quality adjusted life years ( QALY )  being the most frequently used outcome measure in a life-time horizon . A small number of the included studies ( 13 of 64 ) were eligible for EURONHEED transferability checklist . The  overall transferability scores  ranged from 0.50 to 0.97 , with an average score of 0.75 . The  average score per section  was 0.69 ( range = 0.35 - 0.92 ) . The relative transferability of the studies could not be established due to a limitation present in the EURONHEED method .  All existing economic evaluations in smoking cessation lack in one or more key study attributes necessary to be fully transferable to a new context."
"mBackground   Patient-reported outcome measures  ( PROMs )  are intended to reflect outcomes relevant to patients . They are increasingly used for healthcare quality improvement . To produce valid measures , patients should be involved in the development process but it is unclear whether this usually includes  people with low literacy skills or learning disabilities .  This potential exclusion raises concerns about whether these groups will be able to use these measures and participate in quality improvement practice s. Methods Taking   PROMs  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD )  as an exemplar condition , our review determined the inclusion of  people with low literacy skills and learning disabilities in research developing , validating , and using 12 PROMs for COPD patients .  The studies included in our review were based on those identified in two existing systematic review s and our up date of this search . Results  People with low literacy skills and /or learning disabilities  were excluded from the development of  PROMs  in two ways : explicitly through the participant eligibility criteria and , more commonly , implicitly through recruitment or administration methods that would require high-level reading and cognitive abilities . None of the studies mentioned efforts to include  people with low  literacy skills or learning disabilities . Conclusion Our findings suggest that  people with low literacy skills or learning disabilities  are left out of the development of  PROMs .  Given that implicit exclusion was most common , research ers and those who administer PROMs may not even be aware of this problem . Without effort to improve inclusion , unequal quality improvement practice s may become embedded in the health system."

"dGlycemic  variability ( GV )  has been an emerging target for preventing complications related to type  2 diabetes .  For reducing  GV  ,  DPP-IV inhibitors  have shown effectiveness compared to other  oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs ( OADs )  , but systematic evaluation has yet to be existed . A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) were performed to evaluate the effect of  DPP-IV inhibitors  compared with  other OADs  , on GV as measured by  mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( MAGE ) .  Search es were conducted using Pubmed , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library , from which eligible studies  were  retrieved  ; seven RCTs were included in the analysis .   DPP-IV inhibitors  were found to significantly  reduce MAGE  compared to other OADs ( mean difference = −14.61 ; 95 % CI = −19.00 to −10.21 ; p < 0.0001 ) without significant heterogeneity among  sulfonylureas  ( mean difference = −14.93 ; 95 % CI = −21.60 to −8.26 ; p < 0.0001 ) . Initial combination therapy  with DPP-IV inhibitors  more  effectively reduced MAGE  than stepwise add-on therapies ( p = 0.006 ) , although  no differences in MAGE  were found based on HbA1c values . These findings indicate  that DPP-IV inhibitors  are promising alternatives for  reducing GV  in  type 2 diabetes patients .  However , further studies utilizing larger numbers of patients and longer-term follow-ups are needed."

"nOsteoporosis ( OP ) is a major public health concern , but still OP care does not meet guidelines . Interventions have been developed to improve appropriate OP management . The objective of the present study was to systematic ally review the current literature to ascertain the efficacy of  interventions to improve OP care  and characterize interventions taking into account elements related to their potential cost and feasibility .  Studies published from 2003 to 2018  were retrieved from PubMed / MEDLINE , Science Direct , Web of Science , Cochrane , and Wiley Online Library data bases . Screening of references and quality assessment were independently performed by two review ers . We classified interventions into three types according to the target of the intervention : health system  ( structural interventions )  , healthcare professional ( HCP ) , and patient . Meta- analysis was performed by type of intervention and their effect on two outcomes :   prescription of BMD measurement  and  prescription of OP therapy .    A total of 4268 records were screened ; 32 studies  were included in the qualitative analysis and 29 studies in the quantitative analysis . Structural interventions strongly and significantly  improved prescription of BMD measurement  ( OR = 9.99 , 95 % CI 2.05 ; 48.59 ) and  treatment prescription  ( OR = 3.82 , 95 % CI 2.16 ; 6.75 ) . The impact of HCP-centered interventions on  BMD measurement prescription  did not reach statistical significance ( OR = 2.19 , 95 % CI 0.84 ; 5.73 ) but significantly improved  treatment prescription  ( OR = 3.82 , 95 % CI 2.16 ; 6.75 ) . Interventions involving patients significantly  improved the prescription of BMD measurement  ( OR = 2.16 , 95 % CI 1.62 ; 2.89 ) and  treatment prescription  ( OR = 1.70 , 95 % CI 1.35 ; 2.14 ) .  Interventions to improve OP management  had a significant  positive impact on prescription of BMD measurement  but a more limited impact on treatment prescription."
"eAIM To assess , through a systematic review , evidence for the effects of  antiarrhythmic drugs ( AADs )  on   cardiovascular ( CV ) hospitalization and mortality .   MATERIAL S & METHODS English language articles were identified using MEDLINE , EMBASE and the Cochrane Clinical Trial Registry and were screened for study applicability and method ological quality . RESULTS Out of  3526 identified studies , 38 were selected for analysis  ( 19 evaluated  individual AADs  , 13 compared  rate- versus rhythm-control strategies  , and 6 evaluated  multiple AADs  but did not report outcomes for individual agents ) . None of the studies examining  individual AADs  employed the  CV hospitalization end point  used in ATHENA ( the reference trial ) . There were no head-to-head comparisons of  individual AADs  on  CV hospitalization .  Most high- quality studies used multidrug rate- versus rhythm-control strategies .  Assessment of the comparative effectiveness of  individual AADs  on  CV hospitalization and mortality  end points is not possible with the current evidence."
"yThe purpose of this systematic review was to determine the quality of the research and to assess the reliability of different  types  of  physical examination procedures  used in the assessment of  patients with non-specific low back pain .  A search of electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , PEDro , AMED , EMBASE , Cochrane , and CINAHL ) up to August 2005 identified  48 relevant studies  which were analysed for quality and reliability . Pre-established criteria were used to judge the quality of the studies and satisfactory reliability , and conclusions emphasised high quality studies ( > or = 60 % methods score ) . The  mean quality score  of the studies was 52 % ( range 0 to 88 % ) , indicating weak to moderate methodology . Based on the upper threshold used ( kappa/ICC > 0.85 ) most procedures demonstrated either conflicting evidence or moderate to strong evidence of low  reliability .  When the lower threshold was used ( kappa/ICC > 0.70 ) evidence about  pain response  to repeated movements changed from contradictory to moderate evidence for high reliability . Most procedures commonly used by clinicians in the examination of  patients with back pain  demonstrate low reliability."
" None of the specific techniques that were compared reduced the two main  adhesion-related clinical outcomes , small bowel obstruction and infertility .  The meta- analysis provides little evidence for the surgical principle that using less invasive techniques , introducing less foreign bodies or causing less ischaemia reduces the extent and severity of adhesions."
"sAttention-deficit  hyperactivity disorder  ( ADHD ) is a common childhood behavioural disorder . Systematic review s indicate that the community prevalence globally is between 2 % and 7 % , with an average of around 5 % . At least a further 5 % of  children  have substantial difficulties with   overactivity  , inattention ,  and  impulsivity  that are just under the threshold to meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD . Estimates of the administrative prevalence ( clinical ly diagnosed or recorded ) vary worldwide , and have been increasing over time . However , ADHD is still relatively under-recognised and underdiagnosed in most countries , particularly in  girls and older children .  ADHD often persists into adulthood and is a risk factor for other mental health disorders and negative outcomes , including  educational underachievement , difficulties with employment and relationships , and criminality .  The timely recognition and treatment of  children with ADHD-type difficulties  provides an opportunity to improve long-term outcomes . This Review includes a systematic review of the community and administrative prevalence of ADHD in  children and adolescents  , an overview of barriers to accessing care , a description of associated costs , and a discussion of evidence -based pathways for the delivery of clinical care , including a focus on key issues for two specific age groups-younger children ( aged ≤6 years ) and adolescents requiring transition of care from child to adult services."
"nINTRODUCTION Panic disorder ( PD ) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder characterized by unexpected and recurrent panic attacks .  PD patients  present significant psychosocial impairment and a high risk of psychiatric comorbidities and suicide . PD should be treated effectively as soon as the symptoms emerge because the longer these patients remain without treatment , the worse the prognosis will be . AREAS COVERED The authors carried out a systematic review of the literature regarding the pharmacological treatment of PD in the last 10 years . Only open studies , placebo-controlled studies or comparative clinical trials were selected . EXPERT OPINION Compounds with reported effectiveness in the treatment of PD included  tricyclic antidepressants , benzodiazepines , serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) and other drugs . SSRIs  and  SNRIs  are the first-line compounds in the treatment of PD . These drugs were  better tolerated  than tricyclics and benzodiazepines as they had a  low risk of dependence and overdosing complications .  The serotonergic , noradrenergic and GABAergic pathways play a major role in the fear network and in the physiopathology of PD . A better underst and ing of the role of these neurotransmitter systems in PD will allow the development of more  effective  drugs for this psychiatric condition."
"yCONTEXT While the main focus of a meta- analysis is often to assess the effectiveness of a particular intervention in managing or curing a specific condition , there exists a substantial amount of information within published systematic review s that could be used to assess the validity of a generic hypothesis about the effectiveness of an intervention across a range of different but related conditions . OBJECTIVE To systematic ally search for and then collate the results of meta-analyses for the effectiveness of  antibiotic prophylaxis  in  preventing postoperative wound infection  across  various types of surgery  in order to assess generic hypotheses about the effectiveness of this intervention in surgery as a whole . With the relative risk of wound infection used as the measure of clinical effectiveness , the hypotheses to be assessed were first that antibiotic prophylaxis would be an effective intervention for preventing wound infection over a broad range of different surgical procedures , and second that there would be a substantial difference in the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis between "" clean "" and "" contaminated "" surgical procedures . DATA SOURCES Medline and the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s. STUDY SELECTION Eligible meta-analyses were meta-analyses published between  1990 and 2006 of r and omized controlled  trials that looked at the effectiveness of  prophylactic antibiotics  versus  no antibiotic or placebo  in preventing postoperative wound infections . DATA EXTRACTION Independent data extraction by multiple observers . RESULTS The first hypothesis was strongly supported by the data as evidence d by the fact that the estimates of the  relative risk of infection  for the 23 types of surgery that were included in the study were all less than 1 . However , there was no real evidence supporting the second hypothesis that the  relative risk of wound infection  would substantially vary over different levels of surgery cleanliness .  : As well as antibiotic prophylaxis being a generally effective intervention for preventing postoperative wound infection , the level of this effectiveness would appear to be reasonably independent of what type of surgery is being considered . Therefore , the general prevailing attitude that antibiotic prophylaxis should be assumed to be ineffective unless its effectiveness has been experimentally proven beyond doubt for the specific type of surgery being considered , perhaps should be revised . In particular , perhaps a sensible philosophy would be to assume that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the  risk of wound infection  for all types of surgery , even ones where no clinical trial data exists and make exceptions to this rule if , for certain types of surgery , it can be proved to the contrary."
"eObjective : To give a systematic review of clinical measurement scales used to assess  trunk performance  after  stroke  . Data sources : The data bases CINAHL , Cochrane , Pedro and PubMed were search ed with the terms  ` sitting balance ' plus ` stroke '  and  ` trunk ' plus ` stroke '  mentioned in the title or abstract . Data bases were search ed from inception to January 2006 . Review methods : All articles were selected which reported or included a  clinical measure of  trunk performance  used in an adult stroke population .  Reference lists were search ed as secondary sources of articles . Results : A  total of 458 articles result ed from the data base search . Thirty-two articles were eligible for inclusion .  Earlier studies mentioned ordinal single items or a combination of items which are part of a larger scale used to assess  sitting balance  as a derived measure of  trunk performance .  Three clinical tools were available which specifically evaluated  trunk performance  after stroke ; the Trunk  Control  Test and two  Trunk Impairment Scales .  Conclusion : Ordinal single items or subscales of existing larger scales lack a systematic evaluation of psychometric characteristics . Both Trunk Impairment Scales have been extensively examined . A comparative study assessing psychometric properties of the Trunk Control Test and two Trunk Impairment Scales could determine which should be the measure of choice when assessing trunk performance after stroke."
"yOBJECTIVES The purpose of this paper was to review current literature on the clinical effectiveness of contemporary  adhesives  when used to restore  cervical non-carious class-V lesions .  Restoration retention in function of time was recorded in order to find out if  adhesives  with a simplified application procedure are as clinical ly effective as conventional  three-step adhesives  . DATA SOURCES Literature published  from January 1998 up to May 2004  was review ed for university-centred clinical trials that tested the clinical effectiveness of adhesives in  non-carious class-V lesions .   Restoration-retention rates  per adhesive reported in peer- review ed papers as well as IADR-AADR abstract s and ConsEuro abstract s were included and depicted as a function of time in graphs for each of the five adhesive classes  (  three- and two-step etch- and -rinse  adhesives , two- and one-step  self-etch  adhesives , and glass-ionomers )  . The guidelines for dentin and enamel adhesive material s advanced by the American Dental Association were used as a reference . Per class , the  annual failure rate  ( % ) was calculated .  Kruskal-Wallis analysis  and  Dwass-Steel-Chritchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons  were used to determine statistical differences between the  annual failure percentages  of the five adhesive categories . RESULTS  Comparison of retention of class-V adhesive restorations  as a measure to determine  clinical bonding effectiveness  of adhesives revealed that glass-ionomers most  effectively and durably bond to tooth  tissue . Three-step  etch- and -rinse adhesives  and  two-step self-etch adhesives  showed a clinical ly reliable and predictably good  clinical performance .  The  clinical effectiveness  of two-step  etch- and -rinse adhesives  was less favourable , while an inefficient  clinical performance  was noted for the one-step  self-etch adhesives .  SIGNIFICANCE Although there is a tendency towards adhesives with simplified application procedures , simplification so far appears to induce loss of effectiveness . Clinical performance can be correlated with , and predicted by , appropriate types of laboratory study."
"sGraphical abstract Figure . No Caption available . Abstract The results of human clinical trials have revealed that the effects of  resveratrol  on adipokines are inconsistent . Our objective was to eluci date the role of  resveratrol supplementation  on adipokines through a systematic review and a meta‐ analysis of available r and omized  placebo‐controlled  trials ( RCTs ) .1 The search included PubMed ‐ MEDLINE , SCOPUS and ISI web of sciences data base till up to  6th November  2016 .  Weight mean differences (WMD)2  were calculated for net changes in adipokines using fixed‐effects or r and om‐effects models ; meta‐regression analysis and publication bias were conducted in accordance with st and ard methods .  Nine RCTs with 11 treatment arms were eligible  for  inclusion  in this systematic review and meta‐ analysis . Meta‐ analysis of data from 10 treatment arms showed a significant  change in plasma adiponectin concentrations   following resveratrol  supplementation ( WMD : 1.10 & mgr;g/ml , 95%CI : 0.88 , 1.33 , p < 0.001 ) ; Q = 11.43 , I2 = 21.29 % , p = 0.247 ) . There was a significant  greater adiponectin‐reducing effect  in trials with higher than or equal to 100 mg/day ( WMD : 1.11 & mgr;g/ml , 95%CI : 0.88 , 1.34 , p < 0.001 ) , versus those with less than 100 mg/day dosage ( WMD : 0.84 & mgr;g/ml , 95%CI : −0.62 , 2.31 , p = 0.260 ) . Meta‐ analysis of data from 5 treatment arms did not find any significant  change in plasma leptin concentrations   following resveratrol  supplementation ( WMD : 3.77 ng/ml , 95 % CI : −2.28 , 9.83 , p = 0.222 ; Q = 8.00 , I2 =  50.01 % ) . Resveratrol   significantly improves adiponectin but does not affect leptin concentrations  . Additional studies are required to further evaluate the potential benefits  of resveratrol  on adipokines in humans."

"tAdded sugars are a controversial and hotly debated topic . Consumption of  added sugars  has been implicated in increased risk of a variety of chronic diseases including obesity , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) as well as cognitive decline and even some cancers . Support for these putative associations has been challenged , however , on a variety of fronts . The purpose of the current review is to summarize high impact evidence including systematic review s , meta-analyses , and r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , in an attempt to provide an overview of current evidence related to added sugars and health considerations . This paper is an extension of a symposium held at the Experimental Biology 2015 conference entitled "" Sweeteners and Health : Current Underst and ings , Controversies , Recent Research Findings and Directions for Future Research "" . We conclude based on high quality evidence from r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) , systematic review s and meta-analyses of cohort studies that singling out added sugars as unique culprits for metabolically based diseases such as obesity , diabetes and cardiovascular disease appears inconsistent with modern , high quality evidence and is very unlikely to yield health benefits . While it is prudent to  consume added sugars  in moderation , the reduction of these components of the diet without other reductions of caloric sources seems unlikely to achieve any meaningful benefit."
",Probiotics have been suggested to play an important role in the management of  diabetes  . We conducted a systematic review on the role of  probiotics  in modulating parameters related to  diabetes in animal and human experiments .  We search ed Pubmed , Scopus and Cochrane central until June 2014 , concerning the effects of  probiotics  on hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia and their anti-diabetic efficacies by modulating the activities of proinflammatory and antioxidant factors .  Our initial search retrieved 1120 reports .  After screening titles and abstract s ,  72 full-text articles  were review ed for eligibility .  Ultimately  ,  33 articles met our inclusion criteria consisting of five human and twenty eight animal reports .   Lactobacillus strains  were , in particular , used in all studies with or without other strains . We found that probiotics have beneficial effects on  glycemic controls  , as all human studies showed significant reductions in at least one of the primary outcome endpoints which were the  levels of fasting plasma glucose , postpr and ial blood glucose , glycated haemoglobin , insulin , insulin resistance and onset of diabetes ;  similarly , all the animal reports , except for two , documented significant changes in these parameters . Regarding secondary outcome measures , that is ,  lipid profiles , pro-inflammatory and anti-oxidant factors  , only one human and one animal study failed to show any significant changes in any of these parameters . This systematic review generally demonstrated beneficial effects of the  probiotic administration  , especially  Lactobacillus sub-strains  , on the management of  diabetes-related blood parameters  , although , more evidence , especially from human trials , is needed to confirm these effects and also to conduct a meta- analysis .

"sPurpose of Review We performed a systematic review to eluci date the current guidelines on  weaning patients from  opioids  in the post-operative ambulatory surgery setting  , and how pain management intraoperatively can impact this process . Design The review highlights the most up-to- date research from clinical trials , patient reports , and retrospective studies regarding both the current guidelines and weaning of  opioid analgesia  in ambulatory surgery setting .Recent Findings A striking paucity of convincing evidence exists on ambulatory postoperative pain management discontinuation or weaning of pain medications . However , retrospective and patient-reported studies suggest our approach should be similar to acute pain management strategies . The first steps include identifying high-risk  patients  and devising an appropriate pain plan . This may be accomplished by implementing  multimodal analgesia , anticipating opioid needs  , and the proper use  of regional anesthesia .  The increasing roles for Transitional Pain Service ( TPS ) , Perioperative Surgical Home ( PSH ) , and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) may also guide us in this process . Summary  Patients discharged from same-day surgery  may lack the additional infrastructure of a hospital or medical establishment to monitor postoperative recovery . As such , weaning of pain medications in ambulatory surgery setting s requires teams that are adept at treating varied  patient population  s through a tailored , novel means that invoke multimodal  analgesia  . Given the growth of surgeries moving toward the ambulatory sector , more data and practice guidelines are needed to direct postoperative pain regimen titration for the patients."

"sEnhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) pathways are now implemented worldwide with strong evidence that adhesion to such protocol reduces  medical complications , costs and hospital stay .  This concept has been applied for pancreatic surgery since the first published guidelines in 2012 . This study presents the up date d ERAS recommendations for   pancreatoduodenectomy ( PD )   based on the best available evidence and on expert consensus . A systematic literature search was conducted in three data bases ( Embase , Medline Ovid and Cochrane Library Wiley ) for the 27 developed ERAS items . Quality of r and omized trials was assessed using the Consoli date d St and ards of Reporting Trials statement checklist . The level of evidence for each item was determined using the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system .  The Delphi method was used to vali date the final recommendations .  A total of 314 articles were included in the systematic review .  Consensus among experts was reached after three rounds . A well-implemented ERAS protocol with good compliance is associated with a reduction in  medical complications and length of hospital stay .  The highest level of evidence was available for five items :  avoiding hypothermia , use of wound catheters as an alternative to epidural analgesia , antimicrobial and thromboprophylaxis protocol s  and  preoperative nutritional interventions  for  patients with severe weight loss  ( > 15 % ) . The current up date d ERAS recommendations for PD are based on the best available evidence and processed by the Delphi method . Prospect i ve studies of high quality are encouraged to confirm the benefit of current up date d recommendations."

" The current literature review and meta- analysis demonstrates that COCs decrease circulating  levels of total T and free T and increase SBHG concentrations  . Due to the SHBG increase  , free T levels  decrease twice as much as  total T.  The estrogen dose and  progestin  type of the COC do not influence the decline of  total and free T  , but both affect SHBG . The clinical implication s of suppressed and rogen levels during COC use remain to be eluci date."
"dOBJECTIVE This study aim ed at exploring available  clinical instruments  and methods for assessing  physical oral health  , and at identifying those with sufficient diagnostic performance . METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase and MEDLINE . Identified instruments and methods were critically appraised , and quality of diagnostic performance was rated by two independent review ers as A ( sufficient diagnostic performance ) , B ( either sufficient reliability or validity ) or C ( insufficient quality , or empirical results unsatisfactory and /or inconsistent ) . For all A-rated instruments and methods , an in-depth literature search was conducted to supplement and verify their effectiveness and accuracy . RESULTS A  total of 141 instruments and methods were identified .  Only 12 methods with sufficient  diagnostic performance  could be rated as A , 72 were rated as B , and 34 received a C-rating . Further 23 instruments and methods could not be rated due to lack of available information on  diagnostic performance  . Of all A-rated instruments , six were design ed for tooth structure , two for periodontium , one for endodontium and three for temporom and ibular joints and muscles .  Even though some instruments and methods exhibited good to excellent  reliability and validity  and can be recommended for research and clinical practice , they do not allow assessing all components of physical oral health . There is a need to identify and define st and ard instruments , and for components of physical oral health where methods with sufficient diagnostic performance are lacking , further research is required."
"eThis systematic review examined the measurement properties of the  6-min walk test ( 6MWT ) , incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT ) and endurance shuttle walk test ( ESWT )  in  adults with chronic respiratory disease .  Studies that report the evaluation or use of the  6MWT , ISWT  or  ESWT  were included . We search ed electronic data bases for studies published between January 2000  and  September  2013  . The  6-min walking distance ( 6MWD )  is a reliable measure ( intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.82 to 0.99 in seven studies ) . There is a  learning effect  , with greater  distance walked  on the second test ( pooled mean improvement of 26 m in 13 studies ) .  Reliability  was similar for ISWT and ESWT , with a  learning effect  also evident for ISWT ( pooled mean improvement of 20 m in six studies ) . The  6MWD  correlates more strongly with  peak work capacity  ( r=0.59 - 0.93 ) and  physical activity  ( r=0.40 - 0.85 ) than with  respiratory function  ( r=0.10 - 0.59 ) . Method ological factors affecting 6MWD include  track length , encouragement , supplemental oxygen and walking aids .  Supplemental oxygen also affects  ISWT and ESWT performance . Responsiveness  was moderate to high for all tests , with greater responsiveness to interventions that included exercise training . The findings of this review demonstrate that the 6MWT , ISWT and ESWT are robust tests of functional exercise capacity in adults with chronic respiratory disease."
" The results of this study did not show significant differences for root fracture incidence  between metal- and fiber posts .  However , the studies included in this review presented a high risk of bias , and further well- design ed clinical studies are required to confirm these findings."
 The strength of evidence is limited by the relatively small number of trials identified and by their low method ological quality and short follow-up duration . Well- design ed r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) with long-term follow-up are required.
"sAbstract Background : Although non-specific  low back pain  ( LBP ) is known to be multifactorial , studies from across the globe have documented their higher prevalence in  nurses .  This systematic review was conducted to ascertain whether this much-documented association constitutes a causal relationship , and whether there is a discernible threshold of exposures associated with this elevated risk . Methods : PRISMA guidelines were followed and st and ard critical appraisal tools were applied . The outcome of interest was  non-specific LBP or back injury ;  exposure was “  performing nursing duties  . ” Applicable studies , published in  English during 1980–2012  , were identified through data base search es , screened against preset inclusion /exclusion criteria .  Ergonomic assessment s  of  nursing tasks  were included along with epidemiological studies . Bradford Hill considerations for causation were utilized as a framework for discussing findings . Findings : Of  987 studies identified , 89 qualified for inclusion , comprising 21 longitudinal , 36 cross-sectional analytic , 23 descriptive biomechanical/ergonomic , and 9 review studies .  Overall studies showed that nursing activities conferred increased  risk  for , and were associated  with back disorders  regardless of nursing technique , personal characteristics , and non-work-related factors . Patient h and ling appears to confer the highest risk , but other nursing duties are also associated with elevated risk , and confound dose – response assessment s related to patient h and ling alone . Associations were strong , consistent , temporally possible , plausible , coherent , and analogous to other exposure- outcomes , with risk estimates ranging from 1·2 to 5·5 depending on definitions . A threshold of nursing activities below which the  risk of back disorders  is not elevated has not been established . Interpretation : Notwithst and ing the bio-psycho-social nature of LBP , and complexities of study ing this area , sufficient evidence exists of a causal relationship between nursing tasks and back disorders to warrant new policies."
" and Relevance  Cannabinoid drugs  may prevent the onset of  pain  by producing small increases in  pain thresholds  but may not reduce the intensity of  experimental pain  already being experienced ; instead , cannabinoids may make experimental pain feel  less unpleasant  and more  tolerable  , suggesting an influence on affective processes . Cannabis-induced improvements in  pain-related negative affect  may underlie the widely held belief that cannabis relieves pain."
" There is not enough evidence to support any benefit of  sulfasalazine  in reducing  pain , disease activity , radiographic progression , or improving physical function and spinal mobility  in the treatment of AS . A statistically significant benefit in reducing the  erythrocyte sedimentation rate and easing spinal stiffness  was mentioned in the previous version . However , the effect size was very small and not clinical ly meaningful . More withdrawals because of side effects occurred with  sulfasalazine .  Further studies , with larger sample sizes , longer duration , and using vali date d outcome measures are needed to verify the uncertainty of  sulfasalazine  in AS."
"PDynamic  sitting  has been proposed to reduce   low back pain  ( LBP ) and /or low back discomfort ( LBD )  while sitting . This is supported by studies suggesting that  subjects with LBP  assume more static , sustained postures while sitting . This systematic review investigated the effect of  dynamic sitting  on LBP among  subjects with LBP and the development of LBD among pain-free subjects .  Electronic data bases were search ed by two independent assessors . All  prospect  i  ve  studies which compared the effect of a  dynamic sitting condition  on  LBP or LBD  to another  sitting condition  were eligible , with no minimum follow-up period applied . The quality of the included studies was assessed using the PEDro scale .  Seven high- quality studies were eligible  , including five crossover studies and two r and omised controlled trials . The results suggest there is currently no evidence to support the use of  dynamic sitting  as a st and -alone approach in the management of  LBP .  Practitioner Summary : This systematic review investigated the effect of  dynamic sitting  on  LBP or LBD .   Seven high- quality studies  met the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Overall , the evidence suggests that  dynamic sitting approaches  are  not effective  as a st and -alone management approach for LBP."
"nBackground Adult obesity is globally recognized as a public health concern . As adults spend most of their weekdays at work ,  worksite wellness programs  may include topics of  nutrition education  and  physical activity  to improve an  employee  's body composition . However , results are inconsistent with the impact they have on  employees '  body composition  .  Objective The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate   worksite wellness nutrition and physical activity programs  and their subsequent impact on participants ' body composition  .   Methods Extraction of articles was completed through 4 data bases : PubMed , CINAHL , SCOPUS , and PsycINFO using keywords such as  "" nutrition and physical activity interventions  /programs "" and "" weight . "" A 9-point inclusion criterion was established . Evaluation of the articles was assessed using the  Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence -Based Manual .  Results  A total of 962 articles were identified . Twenty-three  met the inclusion criterion . Seventeen studies result ed in a change in  body composition  ( e.g. ,  decreased BMI ( kg/m2 ) , waist circumference , and body fat percentage )  , and six studies did not show any changes . Programs that had professionals frequently interact with participants , regardless if the interactions were done daily , weekly , or monthly , led to a change in  body composition .  Additionally , programs that incorporated a motivation theory and provided content relevant to participants ' needs result ed in a change in  body composition .  Conclusion Evidence supports that future  worksite wellness programs  that are design ed using a motivational theory and content that is created relevant to participants ' needs and that has frequent interactions with participants may result in a change in body composition."
"dBACKGROUND Although there are controversial issues ( the "" American view "" and the "" European view "" ) regarding the construct and definition of agoraphobia ( AG ) , this syndrome is well recognized and it is a burden in the lives of millions of people worldwide . To better clarify the role of drug therapy in AG , the authors summarized and discussed recent evidence on pharmacological treatments , based on clinical trials available from 2000 , with the aim of highlighting pharmacotherapies that may improve this complex syndrome . METHODS A systematic review of the literature regarding the pharmacological treatment of AG was carried out using MEDLINE , EBSCO , and Cochrane data bases , with keywords individuated by MeSH research . Only r and omized ,  placebo-controlled  studies or comparative clinical trials were included . RESULTS After selection ,  25 studies were included . All  the  selected studies included patients with AG associated with panic disorder .  Effective compounds included  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants , selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors , and benzodiazepines . Paroxetine , sertraline , citalopram , escitalopram ,  and  clomipramine  showed the most consistent results , while  fluvoxamine , fluoxetine  , and  imipramine  showed limited efficacy . Preliminary results suggested the potential  efficacy  of  inositol ; D-cycloserine  showed mixed results for its ability to improve the  outcome of  exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy .   More studies with the latter compounds are needed before drawing definitive conclusions .  No studies have been specifically oriented toward evaluating the effect of drugs on  AG  ; in the available studies , the improvement of AG might have been the consequence of the reduction of panic attacks . Before developing a "" true "" psychopharmacology of AG it is crucial to clarify its definition . There may be several potential mechanisms involved , including  fear-learning processes , balance system dysfunction , high light sensitivity , and impaired visuospatial abilities  , but further studies are warranted."
"sCurrent guidelines on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease recommend  nurse-coordinated care ( NCC )  as an effective intervention . However ,  NCC  programmes differ widely and the efficacy of  NCC  components has not been studied . To investigate the efficacy of  NCC  and its  components  in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease by means of a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and  omised  controlled trials  . 18 r and omised trials ( 11 195 patients in total ) using 15 components of  NCC  met the predefined inclusion criteria .  These components were placed into three main intervention strategies : ( 1 )  risk factor management  ( 13 studies ) ; ( 2 )  multidisciplinary consultation  ( 11 studies ) and ( 3 )  shared decision making  ( 10 studies ) . Six trials combined  NCC components  from all three strategies . In total , 30 outcomes were observed . We summarised observed outcomes in four outcome categories : ( 1  ) risk factor levels  ( 16 studies ) ; ( 2  ) clinical events  ( 7 studies ) ; ( 3  ) patient-perceived health  ( 7 studies ) and ( 4 )  guideline adherence  ( 3 studies ) . Compared with usual care  , NCC   lowered systolic blood pressure  ( weighted mean difference ( WMD ) 2.96 mm Hg ; 95 % CI 1.53 to 4.40 mm Hg ) and  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( WMD 0.23 mmol/L ; 95 % CI 0.10 to 0.36 mmol/L ) .  NCC  also  improved smoking cessation rates  by 25 % ( risk ratio 1.25 ; 95 % CI 1.08 to 1.43 ) .  NCC  demonstrated to have an effect on a  small number of outcomes  .  NCC  that incorporated  blood pressure monitoring , cholesterol control and smoking cessation  has an impact on the improvement of secondary prevention . Additionally ,  NCC  is a heterogeneous concept . A shared definition of  NCC  may facilitate better comparisons of  NCC  content and outcomes."
"  In people with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  , evidence suggests a superiority of RFCA to antiarrhythmic drugs in achieving  freedom from atrial arrhythmias , reducing the need for cardioversion  , and  reducing cardiac-related hospitalisations .  There was uncertainty surrounding the effect of RFCA with significant  bradycardia  ( or need for a  pacemaker )  ,  periprocedural complications  , and  other safety outcomes  . Evidence should be interpreted with caution , as event rates were low and quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low."

"sOBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to systematic ally review the effects of the  adrenoreceptor A1D antagonist naftopidil  in the management of   lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS ) .   METHODS A structured and comprehensive MEDLINE search was conducted for original articles , review s , and metanalyses assessing the clinical pharmacology as well as the safety of  naftopidil  in the treatment of  LUTS secondary to BPH . English- language publications dating from 1950 to 2013 were considered .  RESULTS In the considered timeframe , 14 r and omized clinical trials ( RCT ) were reported . Overall , the outcome measures assessed in the various reports included in the present review were changes from baseline in :  International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) , quality of life ( QoL ) score , maximum urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) , residual volume ( PVR ) , and adverse effects .  Although additional well design ed , worldwide ,  placebo-controlled  and r and omized studies are necessary to confirm the long-term outcomes of  naftopidil  pharmacotherapy , current data suggest that  naftopidil  administration in  BPH patients  provides comparable improvements in  total IPSS , QoL , and urinary symptoms  from baseline relative to 0.2 mg/d  tamsulosin  and 8 mg/d  silodosin  . However ,  improvements  in  Qmax  are generally less with  naftopidil  than with  tamsulosin .  Reported  adverse effects  related to  naftopidil  administration are negligible and usually mild .  It remains unknown whether the data reported on  naftopidil  in the  Japanese population  are applicable in  symptomatic BPH patients from western countries  given that : ( 1 ) no English- language clinical trials have compared  naftopidil  to  placebo  in Western countries ; ( 2 ) all clinical trials available were carried out in Japan ; ( 3 ) in the comparative studies with  tamsulosin  , the dose of this drug was lower than the recommended dose in Western countries ; ( 4 ) no data from long-term clinical trials evaluating drug safety beyond 18 weeks."
"sUse and acceptance of  health economic evaluations  ( HEEs ) has been much greater in developed than in developing nations . Nevertheless , while developing countries lag behind in the development of HEE methods , they could benefit from the progress made in other countries and concentrate on ways in which existing methods can be used or would need to be modified to fulfill their specific needs . HEEs , as context -specific tools , are not easily generalizable from setting to setting . Existing studies regarding generalizability and transferability of HEEs have primarily been conducted in developed countries . Therefore , a legitimate question for policy makers in  Latin America and the Caribbean region ( LAC )  is to what extent HEEs conducted in  industrialized economies and in LAC  are generalizable to LAC ( trans-regional ) and to other LAC countries ( intra-regional ) , respectively . We conducted a systematic review , search ing the  NHS Economic Evaluation Data base  ( NHS EED ) , Office of  Health  Economics  Health Economic Evaluation Data  base ( HEED ) , LILACS  ( Latin America health bibliographic data base ) and NEVALAT ( Latin American Network on HEE ) to identify HEEs published between 1980 and 2004 .  We included   individual patient- and model-based   HEEs (  cost-effectiveness , cost-utility , cost-benefit and cost-consequences analyses  ) that involved  at least one LAC country .  Data were extracted by three independent review ers using a checklist vali date d by regional and international experts . From  521 studies retrieved , 72 were full HEEs ( 39 % r and omized controlled trials [ RCTs ] , 32 % models , 17 % non-r and omized studies and 12 % mixed trialmodeling approach ) .  Over one-third of identified studies did not specifically report the type of HEE .  Cost-effectiveness and cost-consequence analyses  accounted for almost 80 % of the studies . The  three Latin American countries with the highest participation in  HEE  studies were Brazil , Argentina and Mexico .  While we found relatively good st and ards of reporting the study ’s question , population , interventions , comparators and conclusions , the overall reporting was poor , and evidence of unfamiliarity with international guidelines was evident ( i.e. absence of incremental analysis , of discounting  long-term costs and effects  ) . Analysis or description of place-to-place variability was infrequent . Of the  49 trial-based analyses  ,  43 % were single centre , 33 % multinational and 18 % multicentre national .  Main reporting problems included issues related to sample representativeness , data collection and data analysis . Of the 32 model-based studies ( most commonly using epidemiological models ) , main problems included the inadequacy of search strategy , range selection for sensitivity analysis and theoretical justifications . There are a number of issues associated with the reporting and methodology used in  multinational and local HEE  studies relevant for LAC that preclude the assessment of their generalizability and potential transferability . Although the quality of reporting and methodology used in model-based HEEs was somewhat higher than those from trial-based HEEs , economic evaluation methodology was usually weak and less developed than the analysis of clinical data . Improving these aspects in LAC HEE studies is paramount to maximizing their potential benefits such as increasing the generalizability/transferability of their results."

"sObjective A secondary analysis of a systematic review on interventions to improve  osteoporosis ( OP )  investigation and treatment was conducted to examine reported key outcomes :  ( 1 ) the cost of the intervention ; ( 2 ) the proportion of  patients taking OP  medication  beyond 6 months   of  the   intervention ; and ( 3 ) the proportion of patients who re-fractured .  Methods  Fifty-seven articles reporting on 54 studies ( 64 interventions ) from 11 countries were included .   Intervention studies to improve OP management   were eligible if they were conducted in an orthopedic setting and included primary data on ≥20 patients presenting with a hip fracture or any fragility fracture .  To compare outcome data across all interventions regardless of study design , an equated proportion ( EP ) using a denominator based on the intention-to-treat principle was derived . Whether a cost analysis had been conducted , the EP of patients who were taking medication beyond 6 months of the intervention , and the EP of patients who re-fractured during the study period were documented . Results Of the 54 studies , 2 reported a  cost  analysis and demonstrated that the interventions  were at least cost-effective . The EP  for  medication use  beyond 6 months of the intervention ranged from 17 to 56 % for four studies .  The EP for re-fracture  ranged from 0 to 5 % for four studies . Conclusion Most interventions did not report key outcomes . In addition , authors used varying time frames for re-fracture and medication use , making direct comparisons impossible . Authors should consider including  intervention costs , medication  use beyond 6 months of the intervention , and re-fracture data in future fracture secondary prevention programs."
" The best protocol described in this review is the  etching of 9.6 % hydrofluoric acid  for 1 minute , rinsed for 30 seconds , and then air-dried . The  etching of hydrofluoric acid  should be followed by an application of  silane .  Considering the harmful effects of etching with  hydrofluoric acid  , another appropriate suggestion is  mechanical roughening  with s and  blasting  followed by an application of silane."
"yBackground and Objective  Exercise  is a widely accepted treatment known to improve  walking ability  in  persons with peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) ;  however , it has not been confirmed as to whether exercise improves fitness and performance-based function and , consequently , performance of activities of daily living ( ADL ) . This systematic review aims to identify whether any mode of  structured exercise  improves physical fitness or performance-based tests of function and whether improvement in walking ability is related to an improvement in these outcomes . Data Sources and Study Selection Eligible studies included r  and omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) using an  exercise intervention  for the treatment of  intermittent claudication  with fitness ( including the 6-min walk ( 6MW ) , aerobic capacity , shuttle and muscle strength ) tests and performance-based tests of function as the outcomes . Study Appraisal and Methods Assessment of study quality was performed using a modified version of the Physiotherapy Evidence Data base Scale ( PEDro ) . Relative effect  sizes , mean differences ( MDs )  and  95 % confidence intervals  were calculated and adjusted via Hedges ’ bias-corrected for small sample sizes . Regression analyses were performed to establish relationships between walking ability and fitness outcomes . Results Twenty-four RCTs met the inclusion criteria : 19  aerobic training interventions  and 5  progressive resistance training ( PRT ) .   In total 924 participants ( 71 % male ) were studied ; with few participants over 75 years of age and the mean ankle brachial index was mean ± st and ard deviation ( SD ) 0.66 ± 0.06 .  The most common outcome measured  was aerobic capacity  ( 52 % of trials ) , which improved by 8.3 % ± 8.7 % on average . Although there were no significant relationships , up to 16 % of the variance in walking distances can be explained by  changes in walking economy . Muscle strength  was measured in only five trials , improving by 42 % ± 74 % on average . There was a strong significant relationship between  change in plantar flexor muscle strength and change in initial claudication time  ( r = 0.99 ; p = 0.001 )  and absolute claudication time  ( r = 0.75 ; p = 0.05 ) measured on a treadmill across trials measuring this muscle group .  The 6MW distance  was measured in only 14 % of  trials  . Walking  and  PRT significantly  improved 6MW initial claudication distance  ( MD range 52–129 m )  and total walking distance  ( MD range 36–108 m ) in studies that measured this outcome . Only one trial assessed  performance-based tests of function  , and they did not improve significantly . Conclusion Although data are limited , there is a strong significant relationship between  plantar flexor muscle strength and  treadmill walking ability  .  More research is needed to assess improvements in  walking economy  at specific timepoints and whether this translates to improvements in claudication outcomes and measurements pertaining to  muscle strength .  Future trials should focus on interventions that improve lower limb  muscle strength  and assess  muscle strength , power and endurance  across a variety of lower extremity muscle groups in order to underst and these relationships further . The  6MW , muscle strength and performance-based tests of function  such as  chair st and , balance scale , stair climb and gait speed  are understudied in PAD . Future trials should examine the effects of  exercise  on  performance-based tests of function  , which may predict actual  ADL performance  and incident disability."
" Workplace-based physical activity interventions  consisting of at least moderate-intensity activity  improve cardiorespiratory fitness .

" There is currently no firm evidence that  vitamin D supplementation  decreases or increases  cancer occurrence  in  predominantly elderly community-dwelling women  .  Vitamin D₃ supplementation   decreased cancer mortality   and vitamin D supplementation   decreased all-cause mortality  , but these estimates are at risk of type I errors due to the fact that too few participants were examined , and to risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants .  Combined vitamin D₃ and calcium supplements   increased nephrolithiasis  , whereas it remains unclear from the included trials whether vitamin D₃ , calcium , or both were responsible for this effect . We need more trials on  vitamin D supplementation  , assessing the benefits and harms among  younger participants , men , and people with low vitamin D status  , and assessing longer duration of treatments as well as higher dosages of vitamin D. Follow-up of all participants is necessary to reduce attrition bias."
"sThe aim was to evaluate the efficacy of various  types of lasers  used as an adjunct to  chemo-mechanical disinfection of infected root canals  with the outcome measures  '  normal periapical  condition  '  or ' reduction of microbial load ' .  PubMed , CENTRAL and ISI Web of Knowledge literature search es with specific indexing terms and a subsequent h and search were made with stated limits and criteria . Relevant publications were retrieved , followed by interpretation . The quality of each included publication was assessed as high , moderate or low . The initial search process  yielded 234 publications .  All abstract s of these publications were read , and the reference lists of relevant publications were h and - search ed . Ten articles were read in full text and interpreted according to a data extraction form . Five  were  included in the systematic review and were assessed . A meta- analysis was impossible to perform because the included studies were heterogeneous with regard to study design , treatment and outcome measures . Positive effects were reported ; however , no concluding evidence grade could be made because each included study was judged to have low quality , primarily due to lack of a power analysis , blinding and reproducibility . The evidence grade for whether  lasers  can be recommended as an adjunct to chemo-mechanical disinfection of infected root  canals  was insufficient . This does not necessarily imply that  laser  should not be used as an adjunct to root canal treatment but instead underscores the need for future high- quality studies."
"sNutritional  supplements  can influence outcomes for individuals  undergoing major surgery  , particularly in  older persons whose functional reserve is limited .  Accelerating recovery from total hip replacement ( THR ) and total knee replacement ( TKR ) may offer significant benefits . Therefore , we explored the role of  nutritional supplements  in improving recovery following THR and TKR . A systematic review was conducted to source r and omized clinical trials that tested  nutritional supplements  in  cohorts of THR or TKR patients .  Our search yielded nine relevant trials .  Intake of a carbohydrate-containing fluid  is reported to improve  insulin-like growth factor levels ,  reduce  hunger , nausea , and length of stay  , and attenuate the decrease in  whole-body insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose release .   Amino acid supplementation  is reported to reduce  muscle atrophy  and  accelerate return of functional mobility .  One paper reported a suppressive effect of  beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate , L-arginine , and L-glutamine supplementation  on  muscle strength loss  following TKR . There is limited evidence for  nutritional supplementation  in THR and TKR pathways ; however , the low risk profile and potential benefits to adjunctive treatment methods , such as  exercise programs  , suggest  nutritional supplements  may have a role . Optimizing nutritional status pre-operatively may help manage the  surgical stress response  , with a particular benefit for undernourished , frail , or elderly individuals."
"BBackground  Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB )  is considered effective for weight loss and for treatment of many obesity-related metabolic diseases . Ghrelin is an essential orexigenic peptide that plays an indispensable role in controlling body weight and energy homeostasis of  post-operative patients .  This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to investigate changes in the level of fasting total ghrelin following  RYGB .  Methods A systematic literature search of PubMed , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library until April 2018 with keywords “ ghrelin ” and  “ gastric bypass ”  was performed in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines and PRISMA statement . Three review ers independently selected the studies and extracted data . Quality assessment of the included studies was undergone . A r and om effects model was employed to calculate overall effect sizes . Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were subsequently performed . Results  Sixteen studies with 325 patients were included .  We  found ghrelin levels  had an increasing tendency ( SMD = 0.30 ; 95 % CI = 0.04 to 0.57 ) despite moderate heterogeneity ( I2 = 58 % ) . Subsequent subgroup analysis indicated  that ghrelin levels  decreased ( SMD = − 0.49 ; 95 % CI = − 0.98 to 0.00 ) in the short term ( ≤ 3 months ) and increased ( SMD = 0.46 ; 95 % CI = 0.22 to 0.69 ) in the long term ( > 3 months ) after RYGB . Meta-regression showed  that gastric pouch volume , alimentary limb length and biliopancreatic limb length  were not associated with changes in ghrelin levels .  Conclusion Fasting total ghrelin levels  decreased in the short term ( ≤ 3 months ) and increased in the long term ( > 3 months ) after RYGB."

"nThis systematic review and meta- analysis synthesis ed the post-1990 literature examining the effect of   human milk  on morbidity , specifically  necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC )  ,  late onset sepsis ( LOS )  ,  retinopathy of prematurity ( ROP )  ,  bronchopulmonary dysplasia (  BPD ) and neurodevelopment in infants born ≤28 weeks ’ gestation and /or publications with reported infant mean birth weight of ≤1500 g.  Online data bases including Medline , PubMed , CINAHL , Scopus , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were search ed , and comparisons were grouped as follows : exclusive  human milk  ( EHM ) versus exclusive preterm formula ( EPTF ) ,  any human milk ( HM ) versus EPTF , higher versus lower dose HM , and unpasteurised versus pasteurised HM .  Experimental and observational studies were pooled separately in meta-analyses . Risk of bias was assessed for each individual study and the GRADE system used to judge the certainty of the findings .  Forty-nine studies ( with 56 reports ) were included , of which 44 could be included in meta-analyses  .  HM  provided a clear  protective  effect  against NEC  , with an approximate 4 % reduction in incidence  . HM  also provided a  possible reduction in LOS , severe ROP and severe NEC  . Particularly  for NEC  , any  volume of HM  is better than EPTF , and the higher the dose the greater the protection . Evidence regarding pasteurisation is inconclusive , but it appears to have no effect on some outcomes . Improving the intake of mother ’s own milk ( MOM ) and /or  donor HM  results in small  improvements in  morbidity in this population."
"pThe objective of the present systematic review and meta- analysis was to synthesize the available literature data investigating the effects of  low glycaemic index/low glycamic load dietary regimens  on  anthropometric parameters , blood lipid profiles , and indicators of glucose metabolism  in  children and adolescents .  Literature search was performed using the electronic data bases MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of trials with restrictions to r and omized controlled trials , but no limitations concerning language and publication date . Parameters taken into account were :  body weight  ,  body mass index  ,  z-score of body mass index  ,  fat mass  ,  fat-free mass  ,  height  ,  waist  cicrumference ,  hip circumference , waist-to-hip ratio , total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglycerides , diastolic and systolic blood pressure , fasting serum glucose , fasting serum insulin , HOMA-index , glycosylated haemoglobin , and C-reactive protein .  Meta-analyses were performed for each parameter to assess pooled effect in terms of weighted mean differences between the post-intervention ( or differences in means ) of the  low glycaemic index diets  and the respective  high glycaemic index  counterparts . Data analysis was performed using the Review Manager 5.3 . software .  Nine studies enrolling 1.065 children or adolescents met the inclusion criteria .  Compared to diets providing a high gylcaemic index , low glycaemic index protocol s result ed in significantly more pronounced decreases  in serum triglycerides  [ mean differences −15.14 mg/dl , 95 % -CI ( −26.26 , −4.00 ) ]  and HOMA-index  [ mean difference −0.70 , 95 % -CI ( −1.37 , −0.04 ) , fixed-effects model only ] . Other parameters under investigation were not affected by either low or high glycaemic indices . The present systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence of a  beneficial  effect of a  low glycaemic index/load diet  in  children and adolescents being either overweight or obese .  Regarding the limitations of this analysis , further studies adopting a homogenous design are necessary to assure the present findings . Since low glycaemic index/load regimens were not associated with a deterioration of the outcome parameters , these diets should not be categorically excluded when looking for alternatives to change lifestyle habits in this age group."
">Zinc is a mineral that plays a vital role in many biological processes and plays an important role in insulin action and carbohydrate metabolism . It may also have a protective role in the prevention of  atherogenesis .  Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of  Zinc supplementation  on  serum  lipids  in humans  and have demonstrated varying results . We systematic ally evaluated the literature and performed a meta- analysis on the effects of  Zinc supplementation  on  serum lipids .  A five staged comprehensive search of the literature was conducted in the following data bases ; PubMed , Web of Science and SciVerse Scopus for  studies  published before  31st  December 2014 . All  controlled clinical trial in humans  , that included a  Zinc supplement intervention , either alone or in combination with other micronutrients  and evaluated effects on  serum lipids ( total cholesterol [ TC ] , triglycerides [ TG ] , LDL cholesterol [ LDL-c ] and HDL cholesterol [ HDL-c ] ) .  A meta- analysis of selected studies was performed using RevMan v5.3 . The Jaded scale was used to assess the method ological quality of the trials included in the systematic review . A  total of 24 studies were included in Meta analysis , which  included a  total of 33  Zinc interventions  , in a total of 14,515 participants in the Zinc intervention or control group .  The duration of  Zinc supplementation  ranged from 1 month to 7.5 years . The dose of  elemental Zinc  supplemented ranged from 15–240 mg/day  . The pooled mean difference for TC  between Zinc supplemented and placebo groups from r and om effects analysis was −10.92 mg/dl ( 95 % CI : −15.33 , −6.52 ; p < 0.0001 , I2 = 83 % ) ,  while for HDL cholesterol  it was 2.12 mg/dl ( 95 % CI : −0.74 , 4.98 ; p = 0.15 , I2 = 83 % ) .  The pooled mean difference for LDL-c   between  Zinc supplemented and placebo group from r and om effect analysis was −6.87 mg/dl ( 95 % CI : −11.16,-2.58 ; p < 0.001 , I2 = 31  ) and for TG  it was −10.92 mg/dl ( 95 % CI : −18.56 , − 3.28 ; p < 0.01 , I2 = 69 % ) . In  conclusion , Zinc supplementation   has favourable effects on plasma lipid  parameters .  Zinc supplementation   significantly reduced total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol and triglycerides .  Therefore it may have the potential to reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis related morbidity and  mortality ."
"dPurpose of Review The current approach to  diabetes in the elderly  incorporates components from the comprehensive  geriatric  approach . The most up date d guidelines from the American Diabetes Association reflect influence from the consensus made in 2012 with the American Geriatrics Society . Notably , the framework included the evaluation for geriatric syndromes ( falls and urinary incontinence ) , functional and cognitive abilities . The goal for this review is to provide an up date d summary of treatment strategies for  community-dwelling older adults .  We identified the need to exp and our approach by addressing innovative approaches and scientific concepts from  telemedicine , functional medicine  , and  geriatrics .  Recent Findings Findings on cardiovascular protection with  sodium-glucose  co-transporter 2 inhibitors ( SGLT-2i ) and some glucagon-like  peptide 1 receptor agonists  ( GLP-1RA ) support their use for  older patients with diabetes .  However , careful consideration for agent selection must incorporate the presence of geriatric issues , such as geriatric syndromes , or functional and cognitive decline , as they could increase the risk and impact adverse reactions .  Telemedicine interventions  can improve communication and connection between older patients and their providers , and improve glycemic  control  . Functional medicine concepts can offer additional adjuvant strategies to support the therapeutic interventions and management of diabetes in the elderly . Summary A systematic review confirmed the  efficacy and safety  of  metformin  as first-line therapy of type 2 diabetes in the older adult , but multiple reports highlighted the risk for  vitamin  B12 deficiency . R and omized controlled trials showed the  efficacy and safety  of  antihyperglycemic  agents in the elderly , including some with longer duration and lesser risk for  hypoglycemia .  R and omized clinical trials showed  cardiovascular protection  with SGLT-2i  (  empagliflozin ,  canagliflozin  ) and GLP-1RA ( liraglutide , semaglutide ) . The most current guidelines recommend addressing for geriatric syndromes , physical and cognitive function in the elderly , in order to individualize targets and therapeutic strategies . Clinicians managing  diabetes in the elderly  can play a major role for the early detection and evaluation of geriatric issues in their patients .  Telemedicine interventions improve  glycemic control  ,  and  certain functional medicine strategies  could be adjuvant interventions to reduce  inflammation and stress  , but more studies focused on the elderly population are needed."
"dIt is speculated that  lifestyle interventions  known to improve diabetic metabolic state may exert their effects via adipokines . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to evaluate the chronic effects of  physical exercise  on  adiponectin and leptin levels  in  adult prediabetic and diabetic individuals .  PubMed , Embase , Scopus , The Cochrane Library , clinical trials.gov , and WHO Clinical Trials Registry were search ed for r and omized controlled trials . Pooled effects of interventions were assessed as mean difference ( MD ) with r and om effects model . Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test data robustness and subgroup analysis for study heterogeneity .  Twenty-two trials with 2996 individuals were included in the meta- analysis .   Physical exercise   increased levels of adiponectin  ( MD : 0.42 µg/mL ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.23 , 0.60 , p < 0.00001 , n = 19 trials )  and reduced leptin levels  ( MD : −1.89 ng/mL ; 95 % CI , −2.64 , −1.14 , p < 0.00001 , n = 14 trials ) . These results were robust and remained significant after sensitivity analysis .  Study  heterogeneity was generally high . As for  physical exercise  modalities ,  aerobic exercise  , but not other modalities ,  increased adiponectin and reduced leptin levels  . In conclusion ,  physical exercise  and , specifically ,  aerobic exercise  , leads  to higher adiponectin and lower leptin levels   in prediabetic and diabetic adults .  However , cautious interpretation of current findings is warranted."
"sABSTRACT Interest is increasing regarding the potential health effects of  red yeast rice ( RYR )  consumption , which is described as a “ natural statin ” in  China .  This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of  RYR  on  blood pressure ( BP ) , lipid profile , and C-reactive protein ( CRP )  in treating   hypertension  .  Seven electronic data bases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , EMBASE , PubMed , the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) , the Chinese Scientific Journal Data base ( VIP ) , the Chinese Biomedical Literature Data base ( CBM ) , and the Wanfang data base were search ed . To investigate the role of  RYR  for hypertension , r and omized controlled trials for the use of  RYR  either as monotherapy or in combination with  conventional medicine  versus  placebo , no  intervention , or  conventional medicine  for hypertension were identified . A  total of 21 trials containing 4558 patients were analyzed  , the majority of which had low  method ological quality  .  “ RYR plus conventional therapy ”  exhibited significant lowering effects on  serum total cholesterol ( TC ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , and CRP  but exhibited no significant  effect  on  systolic BP , diastolic BP , triglycerides ( TG ) , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C )  compared with  “ placebo plus conventional therapy . ” “ RYR plus conventional therapy ”  showed significant lowering effects on  systolic BP , TC , LDL-C , and CRP but no effect  on  diastolic BP , TG , and HDL-C  compared with  “ placebo plus conventional therapy . ”  No significant difference in  BP and lipid profile  between  “ RYR plus conventional therapy ” and “ statins plus conventional therapy ”  was observed .  “ RYR plus statins ”  appeared to be more  effective  in  lowering BP , TC , TG , and LDL-C  but without a  significant difference  in  HDL-C  compared to  statins .  No  serious adverse events  were reported . The results of this meta- analysis suggested some supportive but limited evidence regarding  RYR  for hypertension . Further rigorously design ed trials are warranted before  RYR  could be recommended to hypertensive patients."
"tThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of  primary care interventions  to improve the detection and treatment  of osteoporosis .  Eight electronic data bases and six gray literature sources were search ed . R and omized controlled trials , controlled clinical trials , quasi-r and omized trials , controlled before – after studies , and interrupted time series written in English or French from 1985 to 2009 were considered . Eligible studies had to include  patients at risk ( women ≥ 65 years , men ≥ 70 years , and men/women ≥ 50 years with at least one major risk factor for osteoporosis ) or at high risk ( men/women using oral glucocorticoids or with previous fragility fractures ) for osteoporosis and fractures .  Outcomes  included bone mineral density ( BMD ) testing , osteoporosis treatment initiation , and fractures  . Data were pooled using a r and om effects model when applicable .  Thirteen studies were included .  The majority were multifaceted and  involved patient educational material , physician notification , and /or physician education .   Absolute differences in the incidence of BMD testing  ranged from 22 % to 51 % for high-risk patients only and from 4 % to 18 % for both at-risk and high-risk patients .  Absolute differences in the incidence of osteoporosis treatment initiation  ranged from 18 % to 29 % for high-risk patients only and from 2 % to 4 % for at-risk and high-risk patients . Pooling the results of six trials showed  an increased incidence of osteoporosis treatment initiation  ( risk difference ( RD ) = 20 % ; 95 % CI : 7–33 % )  and of BMD testing and /or osteoporosis treatment initiation  ( RD = 40 % ; 95 % CI : 32–48 % ) for high-risk patients following intervention . Multifaceted interventions targeting high-risk patients and their primary care providers may improve the management of osteoporosis , but improvements are often clinical ly modest."
"sAIM This paper is a report of a review conducted to provide an overview of the evidence in the literature on  task-oriented training  of  stroke survivors  and its relevance in daily nursing practice . BACKGROUND Stroke is the second leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of adult disability in the Western world . The use of neurodevelopmental treatment in the daily nursing care of stroke survivors does not improve clinical outcomes . Nurses are therefore exploring other forms of  rehabilitation intervention  , including  task-oriented rehabilitation .  Despite the growing number of studies showing evidence on task-oriented interventions , recommendations for daily nursing practice are lacking . DATA SOURCES A range of data bases was search ed to identify papers addressing   task-oriented training  in  stroke rehabilitation   , including Medline , CINAHL , Embase and the Cochrane Library of systematic review s.  Papers published in English between January 1996 and September 2007 were included .  There were  42 papers  in the final data set , including nine systematic review s. REVIEW METHODS The selected r and omized controlled trials and systematic review s were assessed for quality . Important characteristics and outcomes were extracted and summarized . RESULTS Studies of  task-related training  showed benefits for  functional outcome  compared with traditional therapies . Active use of  task-oriented training  with  stroke survivors  will lead to improvements in  functional outcomes and overall health-related quality of life .   Generally ,  task-oriented rehabilitation  proved to be  more effective .  Many interventions are  feasible  for nurses and can be performed in a ward or at home . Nurses can and should play an important role in creating opportunities to practise meaningful functional tasks outside of regular therapy sessions."
"FBACKGROUND Growing evidence suggests that  second-generation cryoballoon ablation ( 2G-CB )  is effective in  patients with persistent atrial fibrillation ( PerAF ) .  The cornerstone of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation is pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) . The purpose of this study was to summarize the available data on the safety and mid-term ( ≥ 12 months ) effectiveness of a  ' PVI-only ' strategy  vs.  a ' PVI-plus ' strategy using 2G-CB  in  patients with PerAF  . METHODS We search ed the PubMed , EMBASE and Cochrane library data bases for studies on  2G-CB  for PerAF . Group analysis was based on the ablation approach :  ' PVI-only ' versus ' PVI-plus '  , the latter of which involved PVI plus other substrate modifications . Studies showing clinical success rates at a follow-up ( FU ) of ≥ 12 months were included  . Complication  rates were also assessed . Data were analyzed by applying a fixed effects model . RESULTS  A total of 879 patients from 5 studies were analyzed .  After a mid-term FU of 27 months ,  the overall success rate   of 2G-CB  for PerAF was 66.1 % . In the ' PVI-plus ' group ,  the success  rate was 73.8 % . In the  '  PVI-only ' group ,  the success rate  was 53.6 % . No heterogeneity was noted among studies ( I2 = 0.0 % ,  P = 0.82 ) .  Complications occurred in 5.2 % of patients ( P =  0.93 )  ,  and the rate of phrenic nerve ( PN )  injury was 2.8 % ( P =  0.14 ) . Vascular assess  complications were the most frequent at 1.6 % ( P =  0.33 ) . No death or myocardial  infa rct ion was reported .   ' PVI-plus ' involving 2G-CB  seems to be  safe and effective  for treating PerAF."

">In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the  risk of  hip fracture   with  milk consumption  were only observed  among American adults ,  but not  among Sc and inavian adults  , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries . The reduction in the  risk of hip fracture  was also observed with  yogurt consumption  , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health . Although dairy products contain bone-beneficial nutrients , the association between dairy consumption and the risk of hip fracture remains equivocal . Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated   risk of hip fracture   in association with   milk consumption  was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .  A systematic review and meta- analysis of prospect i ve cohort studies was performed to critically evaluate the association , or lack thereof , between  dairy consumption ( milk , yogurt , and cheese )  and the risk of  hip fracture .  A r and om effects model was used to generate the  summary relative risks ( RRs )  with their 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for the associations of interest . In the meta- analysis of the highest versus lowest category of consumption , higher consumption of  yogurt  ( RR 0.78 , 95 % CI 0.68 , 0.90 ) , but not  milk  ( RR 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.73 , 1.02 ) or  cheese  ( RR 0.85 , 95 % CI 0.66 , 1.08 ) , was associated with a  lower risk of hip fracture .  For milk , the  reduced risk of fracture  with higher  milk  consumption was observed in the USA ( RR 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.65 , 0.87 ) , but not in Sc and inavian countries ( RR 1.00 , 95 % CI 0.85 , 1.17 ) . These findings were further supported by the fact that American studies ( RR 0.93 , 95 % CI 0.88 , 0.98 ; per 1 glass/day ) , but not Sc and inavian studies ( RR 1.01 , 95 % CI 0.95 , 1.07 ; per 1 glass/day ) , demonstrated a linear association  between milk consumption and the risk of hip fracture .  The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the  risk of hip fracture  may not be elevated among people who consume  milk , yogurt  , and  cheese  , and that a greater consumption of milk or  yogurt  may even be associated with a lower  risk of hip fracture  depending on the factors that may differ across the  population of interest ."
"dOpinion StatementThere are 34 studies in  almost 2 million participants  that have reported on the association between   proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy  and  risk of fracture .   There is substantial variation between the results of each study but systematic review s of the data suggest overall there is an association between  PPI   therapy  and  risk of fracture .  The magnitude of the association is modest and is most likely due to confounding factors as  patients prescribed  PPI therapy   tend to be more frail with more risk factors for fractures than those not given these drugs . There is no clear dose – response relationship and there is no association between PPI therapy and  risk of fracture  in those at highest risk . Finally , there is no clear mechanism through which  PPI  therapy increases the  risk of fracture  , as recent r and omized trials show no impact of PPI therapy on calcium absorption and there is no association between PPI therapy and  risk of osteoporosis .  We therefore feel there is insufficient evidence to change  PPI  prescribing habits based on  risk of fracture .  Similarly , we do not recommend  bone mineral density investigations  for  patients taking  PPI therapy   other than would be normally indicated . There is no evidence to support prescription of  calcium  and /or  vitamin D  in patients simply because they are taking PPI therapy . As with all medications , we only recommend prescribing  PPI therapy  when there is a clear indication that benefit will outweigh risk and at the lowest effective dose . Patients should be regularly assessed as to whether acid suppression is still required."
"xSerotonergic hallucinogens produce alterations of  perceptions , mood , and cognition  , and have  anxiolytic , antidepressant , and antiaddictive properties .  These drugs act as agonists of frontocortical 5-HT2A receptors , but the neural basis of their effects are not well understood . Thus , we conducted a systematic review of neuroimaging studies analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens in  man . Studies  published in  the PubMed , Lilacs  ,  and SciELO data bases until 12 April 2016  were included using the following keywords :  "" ayahuasca "" , "" DMT "" , "" psilocybin "" , "" LSD "" , "" mescaline ""  crossed one by one with the terms  "" mri "" , "" fmri "" , "" pet "" , "" spect "" , "" imaging "" and "" neuroimaging "" .   Of 279 studies identified , 25 were included .   Acute effects included excitation of frontolateral/frontomedial cortex , medial temporal lobe , and occipital cortex , and inhibition of the default mode network .  Long-term use was associated with  thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex , thickening of the anterior cingulate cortex , and decreased neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding .  Despite the high method ological heterogeneity and the small sample sizes , the results suggest that hallucinogens increase  introspection and positive mood  by modulating brain activity in the fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital cortex."
"dBackground : It is now well-established that sedentarity has a negative impact on the physiological functioning and health of humans , whereas very little is known about the psychological repercussions , especially in  cognitive functioning .  Yet , study ing the cognitive effects of the sedentary lifestyle is particularly relevant in the short term for productivity and in the long term for cognitive health ( accelerated aging ) . This systematic review therefore aims to make an inventory of the potential cognitive effects of sedentarity at the workplace . Methods : Pubmed , PsycINFO , Cochrane , Web of Science , and Scopus were search ed for  English- language peer- review ed articles published between January 1 , 2000 and December 31 , 2017  to identify studies including  sedentary  behavior   and objective measures from cognitive domains ( cognitive inhibition , cognitive flexibility , working memory , etc . ) . To carry out this systematic review , the 3 keywords  "" Sedentary "" and "" Cognition "" and "" Work "" ( and their derivatives )  had to appear in the title or in the summary of the paper . Results : Of the  13 papers that met the inclusion criteria  , 9 were short-term interventions , 3 medium-term interventions , and 1 long-term intervention . Nine of them reported non-significant  results  . Two studies study reported  deterioration in cognitive performance .  Two reported an  improvement  in  performance in cognitive tasks  with one study with overweight adults and the only one study with a long-term intervention . However , these studies intend to reduce  sedentary behavior  , but do not allow answering the question of the potential  cognitive effects  of the sedentary lifestyle . Conclusion : These data suggest that sedentary behavior is not associated with changes in  cognitive performance  in interventions that intend to reduce sedentary behavior . Then , and given the trend toward increased time in sedentary behavior , long-term prospect i ve studies of high method ological quality are recommended to clarify the relationships between sedentary behavior and the  cognitive functioning .  Our systematic review identifies also the need for retrospective , longitudinal , or epidemiologic studies . It also recognizes the need to st and ardize methodology for collecting , defining , and reporting sedentary behavior and the need to st and ardize the cognitive tests used . The relationship between  sedentary behavior  and  cognitive functioning  remaining uncertain , further studies are warranted for which 8 recommendations are proposed."
" No convincing evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic medications are superior to typical medications for the treatment of  adolescents with psychosis .  However , atypical antipsychotic medications may be more acceptable to young people because fewer  symptomatic adverse effects  are seen in the short term . Little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic medication over another , but side effect profiles are different for different medications . Treatment with  olanzapine , risperidone  and  clozapine  is often associated with  weight gain .   Aripiprazole  is not associated with  increased prolactin or with dyslipidaemia .   Adolescents  may respond better to st and ard-dose as opposed to lower-dose risperidone , but for  aripiprazole  and  ziprasidone  , lower doses may be equally  effective .  Future trials should ensure uniform ways of reporting."

"COBJECTIVE To present an evidence -based review of the perioperative management of the  radical cystectomy ( RC ) patient  in the context of a care re design initiative . METHODS A comprehensive review of the key factors associated with   perioperative management  of the RC patient  was completed . PubMed , Medline , and the Cochrane data bases were queried via a computerized search . Specific topics were review ed within the scope of the three major phases of perioperative management : preoperative , intraoperative , and postoperative . Preference was given to evidence from prospect i ve r and omized trials , meta-analyses , and systematic review s. RESULTS Preoperative considerations to improve care in the RC patient should include multi-disciplinary medical optimization , patient education , and formal coordination of care . Efforts to mitigate the risk of  malnutrition  and reduce  postoperative gastrointestinal complications  may include  carbohydrate loading , protein nutrition supplementation  , and  avoiding bowel preparation  . Intraoperatively , a fluid and opioid sparing protocol may reduce  fluid shifts  and avoid  complications from paralytic ileus .  Finally , enhanced recovery protocol s including novel medications , early feeding , and multi-modal analgesia approaches are associated with earlier  postoperative convalescence .   RC is a complex and morbid procedure that may benefit from care re design . Evidence based quality improvement is integral to this process . We hope that this review will help guide further improvement initiatives for RC."
" The present systematic review has identified a need for further research on the  validity  of fitness tests in  preschool children  , as well as on their relationship with health . Due to this limited information , the PREFIT battery hereby proposed is based on the output of the current systematic review in  preschool children  , together with existing evidence in older children and adolescents . While we wait for more evidence to be accumulated in  preschool children  , the PREFIT battery hereby proposed is a useful tool for assessing  physical fitness  in children aged 3–5 years."

"SBackground This review examines evidence for an association between   computer work  and carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) .  Methods A systematic review of studies of   computer  work and CTS  was performed . Supplementary , longitudinal studies of low force , repetitive work and CTS , and studies of possible pathophysiological mechanisms were evaluated . Results  Eight epidemiological studies of the association between  computer  work and CTS were identified .  All eight studies had one or more limitation including imprecise exposure and outcome assessment , low statistical power or potentially serious biases . In three of the studies an exposure-response association was observed but because of possible misclassification no firm conclusions could be drawn . Three of the studies found risks below 1 . Also longitudinal studies of repetitive  low-force non-computer work  ( n = 3 ) were review ed but these studies did not add evidence to an association . Measurements of  carpal tunnel pressure ( CTP )  under conditions typically observed among  computer users  showed  pressure  values below levels considered harmful . However , during actual mouse use one study showed an increase of  CTP  to potentially harmful levels . The long term effects of prolonged or repeatedly increased  pressures  at these levels are not known , however . Conclusion There is insufficient epidemiological evidence that  computer  work causes CTS."
" Energy control and food source appear to mediate the effect  of fructose‐containing sugars  on glycaemic control . Although most food sources of these sugars ( especially fruit ) do not have a harmful effect in energy matched substitutions with other macronutrients , several food  sources of fructose‐containing sugars ( especially sugars‐sweetened beverages )  adding excess  energy  to diets have  harmful effects .  However , certainty in these estimates is low , and more high quality r and omised controlled trials are needed . Study registration Clinical trials.gov ( NCT02716870 )."
"(UNLABELLED SUBJECT OF THE EVIDENCE -BASED ANALYSIS : The purpose of this evidence based analysis report is to examine the  safety and effectiveness  of point-of-care ( POC )  international normalized ratio ( INR )  monitoring devices for  patients on  long-term oral anticoagulation therapy ( OAT ) .   CLINICAL NEED TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Long-term  OAT  is typically required by  patients with mechanical heart valves , chronic atrial fibrillation , venous thromboembolism , myocardial infa rct ion , stroke , and /or peripheral arterial occlusion .  It is estimated that approximately 1 % of the population receives  anticoagulation  treatment and , by applying this value to Ontario , there are an estimated  132,000 patients on OAT in the province  , a figure that is expected to increase with the aging population .  Patients on  OAT   are regularly monitored and their medications adjusted to ensure that their  INR scores  remain in the therapeutic range . This can be challenging due to the narrow therapeutic window of warfarin and variation in individual responses . Optimal  INR scores  depend on the underlying indication for treatment and patient level characteristics , but for most patients the therapeutic range is an  INR score  of between 2.0 and 3.0 . The current st and ard of care in Ontario for patients on long-term OAT is laboratory-based INR determination with management carried out by primary care physicians or anticoagulation clinics ( ACCs ) . Patients also regularly visit a hospital or  community-based  facility to provide  a venous blood sample s  (  venipuncture  ) that are then sent to a  laboratory  for INR analysis . Experts , however , have commented that there may be under-utilization of  OAT  due to patient factors , physician factors , or regional practice variations and that sub-optimal patient management may also occur . There is currently no  population -based Ontario  data to permit the assessment of patient care , but recent systematic review s have estimated that less that 50 % of patients receive  OAT  on a routine basis and that patients are in the  therapeutic range  only 64 % of the time . OVERVIEW OF POC INR DEVICES  POC INR devices  offer an alternative to laboratory-based testing and venipuncture , enabling  INR determination  from a fingerstick sample of whole blood . Independent evaluations have shown POC devices to have an acceptable level of precision . They permit  INR results  to be determined immediately , allowing for more rapid medication adjustments . POC devices can be used in a variety of setting s including physician offices , ACCs , long-term care facilities , pharmacies , or by the patients themselves through  self-testing  ( PST ) or  self-management  ( PSM ) techniques . With PST , patients measure their INR values and then contact their physician for instructions on dose adjustment , whereas with PSM , patients adjust the medication themselves based on pre-set algorithms . These models are not suitable for all patients and require the identification and education of suitable c and i date s. Potential advantages of  POC devices  include improved  convenience to patients  , better  treatment compliance  and  satisfaction  , more frequent  monitoring  and fewer  thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications .  Potential disadvantages of the device include the tendency to underestimate high INR values and overestimate low INR values , low thromboplastin sensitivity , inability to calculate a mean normal PT , and errors in INR determination in  patients with antiphospholipid antibodies  with certain instruments . Although  treatment satisfaction and quality of life ( QoL )  may improve with  POC INR monitoring  , some patients may experience increased anxiety or preoccupation with their disease with these strategies . EVIDENCE -BASED ANALYSIS METHODS RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 . EffectivenessDoes  POC INR monitoring  improve clinical outcomes in various setting s compared to st and ard laboratory-based testing?Does POC INR monitoring impact  patient satisfaction , QoL , compliance , acceptability , convenience  compared to st and ard laboratory-based INR determination ? Setting s include  primary care  setting s with use of POC  INR  devices by general practitioners or nurses , ACCs , pharmacies , long-term care homes , and use by the patient either for PST or PSM . 2 .  Cost-effectivenessWhat  is the  cost-effectiveness  of  POC INR monitoring  devices in various setting s compared to st and ard laboratory-based INR determination ?

Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected from the search results . Reference lists of selected articles were also checked for relevant studies . SUMMARY OF FINDINGS  Five existing review s and 22 articles describing 17 unique RCTs met the inclusion criteria .  Three RCTs examined  POC INR monitoring devices with PST strategies  , 11 RCTs examined  PSM strategies  , one RCT included both  PST and PSM strategies  and two RCTs examined the  use of POC INR monitoring devices by health care professionals .   ANTICOAGULATION CONTROL Anticoagulation control  is measured by the percentage of time INR is within the therapeutic range or by the percentage of INR values in the therapeutic range . Due to the differing method ologies and reporting structures used , it was deemed inappropriate to combine the data and estimate whether the difference between groups would be significant . Instead , the results of individual studies were weighted by the number of person-years of observation and then pooled to calculate a summary measure . Across most studies , patients in the intervention  groups  tended to have a higher  percentage of time and values in the therapeutic target range  in comparison to control patients . When the percentage of time in the  therapeutic  range was pooled across studies and weighted by the number of person-years of observation , the difference between the intervention and control groups was 4.2 % for PSM , 7.2 % for PST and 6.1 % for POC use by health care practitioners . Overall , intervention patients were in the  target range  69 % of the time and control patients were in the  therapeutic target range  64 % of the time leading to an overall difference between groups of roughly 5 % .  MAJOR COMPLICATIONS AND DEATHS  There was no statistically significant  difference  in the  number of major hemorrhagic events  between  patients managed with POC INR monitoring devices and patients managed with st and  ard  laboratory testing  ( OR = 0.74 ; 95 % CI : 0.52- 1.04 ) . This  difference  was  non-significant  for all POC strategies ( PSM , PST , health care practitioner ) .  Patients managed with POC INR monitoring devices  had significantly  fewer thromboembolic events  than  usual care patients  ( OR = 0.52 ; 95 % CI : 0.37 - 0.74 ) . When divided by POC strategy , PSM result ed in significantly  fewer thromboembolic events  than usual care ( OR = 0.46 . ; 95 % CI : 0.29 - 0.72 ) . The observed difference in  thromboembolic events  for PSM remained significant when the analysis was limited to major  thromboembolic events  ( OR = 0.40 ; 95 % CI : 0.17 - 0.93 ) , but was non-significant when the analysis was limited to minor thromboembolic events ( OR = 0.73 ; 95 % CI : 0.08 - 7.01 ) . PST and  GP/Nurse  strategies did not result in significant differences in  thromboembolic events  , however there were only a limited number of studies examining these interventions . No statistically significant difference was observed in  the number of deaths  between  POC  intervention and  usual care control  groups ( OR = 0.67 ; 95 % CI : 0.41 - 1.10 ) . This difference was non-significant for all POC strategies . Only one study reported on  survival with 10-year survival rate  of 76.1 % in the  usual care control  group compared to 84.5 % in the PSM group ( P=0.05 ) .

Results from a pre- analysis patient and caregiver focus group conducted in Ontario also indicated  improved patient QoL  with POC monitoring . (."
"sIntroduction  Durability  is a key requirement for the broad acceptance of  bariatric surgery .  We report on  durability  at and beyond 10 years with a systematic review and meta- analysis of all reports providing data at 10 or more years and a  single-centre study of laparoscopic adjustable gastric b and ing ( LAGB )  with 20 years of follow-up . Methods Systematic review with meta- analysis was performed on  all eligble reports containing 10 or more years of follow-up data on weight loss after  bariatric surgery .   In addition , a prospect i ve cohort study  of LAGB patients  measuring weight loss and reoperation at up to 20 years is presented . Results Systematic review identified  57 data sets of which 33 were eligible for meta- analysis .   Weighted means of the percentage of excess weight loss ( % EWL )  were calculated for all papers included in the systematic review . Eighteen reports of  gastric bypass  showed a weighted mean of 56.7%EWL , 17 reports of LAGB showed 45.9%EWL , 9 reports of  biliopancreatic bypass  + /−  duodenal switch  showed 74.1%EWL and 2 reports of  sleeve gastrectomy  showed 58.3%EWL . Meta-analyses of eligible studies demonstrated comparable results .  Reoperations  were common in all groups . At a  single centre , 8378 LAGB patients were followed  for up to 20 years with an overall follow-up rate of 54 % .  No surgical deaths  occurred  . Weight loss  at 20 years ( N = 35 ) was 30.1 kg , 48.9%EWL and 22.2 % total weight loss ( % TWL )  . Reoperation rate  was initially high but reduced markedly with improved b and and surgical and aftercare techniques . Conclusion All current procedures are associated with  substantial and durable weight loss .  More long-term data are needed for  one-anastomosis gastric bypass  and  sleeve gastrectomy   . Reoperation  is likely to remain common across all procedures."
"tThis review examines the effect of a  dual task  on the  gait parameters  of  older adults with a mean gait speed of 1.0 m/s or greater , and the effect of type and complexity of task .  A systematic review of Web of Science , PubMed , SCOPUS , Embase , and PsycINFO was performed in July 2016 .  Twenty-three studies ( 28 data sets )  were review ed and pooled for meta- analysis . The effect size on seven gait parameters was measured as the raw mean difference between single- and dual-task performance .  Gait speed  significantly reduced with the addition of a  dual task  , with increasing complexity showing greater decrements .  Cadence , stride time , and measures of gait variability  were all negatively affected under the dual-task condition . In  older adults  , the addition of a  dual task  significantly reduces  gait speed and cadence  , with possible implication s for the assessment of  older people  , as the addition of a dual  task  may expose deficits not observed under single-task assessment."

"sPurpose The aim of this study was to systematic ally review the literature on  antibiotic prophylaxis  in  gynaecologic surgeries  to prevent  inflammatory complications after gynaecological operations .  The study was carried out as a systematic review . Methods  Only r and omised controlled trials of women undergoing gynaecological surgery were included .  The Medline and the Cochrane library data bases were search ed from 1966 to 2016 . The trials must have investigated an  antibiotic  intervention to prevent an inflammatory complication after gynaecological surgery .  Trials were excluded if they were not r and omised , uncontrolled or included obstetrical surgery .  Results  Prophylactic antibiotics   prevent inflammatory complications  after gynaecological surgery .  Prophylactic antibiotics  are  more effective  in surgery requiring access to the peritoneal cavity or the vagina .  Cefotetan  appears to be more capable in preventing the  overall inflammatory complication rate  than  cefoxitin  or  cefazolin .  No benefit has been shown for the combination of antibiotics as prophylaxis . No difference has been shown between the  long-term and short-term use of antibiotics .  There is no need for the primary use of an anaerobic antibacterial agent . Conclusion Antibiotics help to prevent postoperative inflammatory complications after major gynecologic surgeries."
" Current guidelines and clinical practice for the use of antipsychotic drugs in  women with non-affective disorders during pregnancy and postpartum  are not based on evidence from r and omised controlled trials . Although ethical concerns have to date precluded the use of r and omised controlled trials to address this research topic , the continued use of antipsychotic drugs in this group of women in itself poses significant clinical and ethical problems . Evidence is required from large pragmatic trials that reflect routine clinical practice , examine a broad range of outcomes and accurately quantify risks and benefits to both mothers and their offspring , so that comparison between different treatment options can be made."

" Antihypertensive treatment reduces the  risk of mortality and cardiovascular morbidity  in  people with diabetes mellitus and a systolic blood pressure  more than 140 mm Hg . If  systolic blood pressure  is less than 140 mm Hg , however , further treatment is associated with an increased risk of  cardiovascular death  , with no observed benefit."
"sBackground The aim of this study was to review the effects of  developmental care in neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU )  setting on  mental and motor development  of  preterm infants .  Method We search ed PubMed , EMBASE , CINAHL , Scopus , Web of Science and Cochrane library until October 8th 2017 , and included r and omized controlled trials that assessed effects of  developmental care in NICU  on  mental and motor development   of preterm infants at 12 and 24 months of age  , using the Bayley scale of infant development in this systematic review . In addition , data were pooled by r and om effects model and St and ardized Mean Difference ( SMD ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) , calculated for meta- analysis . Results  Twenty one studies were eligible to be included in this systematic review ;  however , only  thirteen studies  had data suitable for meta- analysis . According to statistical analysis ,  developmental care  in NICU  improved mental developmental index ( MDI )  ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] 0.55 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.23–0.87 ; p < 0.05 ) ,  and psychomotor developmental index ( PDI )  ( SMD 0.33 , [ CI ] 95 % CI 0.08–0.57 ; p < 0.05 ) of BSID at 12 months of age and PDI at 24 months of age ( SMD 0.15 , 95 % CI -0.02–0.32 ; p < 0.1 ) of preterm infants . However , the benefit was not detected at 24 months of age on  MDI  ( SMD 0.15 , 95 % CI -0.05–0.35 ; p = 0.15 ) . Conclusion Current evidence suggests that  developmental care  in only NICU setting could have significant effect  on mental and motor development  of preterm infants , especially at 12 months of age . However , because of clinical heterogeneity , more studies are needed to evaluate the effects of  developmental NICU  care in the development of preterm infants."
" : The review is limited to  children younger than 18 years  and results are specific to health conditions described , limiting generalizability of findings to other population s. Evidence for the measurement  properties  of  fatigue instruments  varied according to the population in which instruments were used and informant . Further evidence is required for assessment of  fatigue  in younger children , and children with particular health conditions."
"nAIM To evaluate the effect of  silymarin  on the  serum levels of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( γGT )  in  patients with liver diseases .  METHODS A systematic review with meta- analysis of ramdomized and controlled clinical trials was performed , evaluating the effects of  sylimarin  in  patients with hepatic diseases , published by January 31 , 2016  . Clinical trials were sought on the basis of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library , PubMed / Medline , Scopus , Web of Science , Lilacs and Clinical Trials . The trials with  adult and elderly patients of both sexes , with Liver Diseases who took  oral silymarin supplementation , as extract or isolated , as well as Silymarin combined with other nutrients  , were included .  The trials should provide information about the intervention , such as dosages and detailing of the product used , besides the mean and st and ard deviation of serum  levels of ALT , AST  and γGT of the baseline and at the end of the intervention . RESULTS  An amount of 10904 publications were identified . From those , only 17 were included in the systematic review and 6 in the meta- analysis , according to the used selection criteria .  In this meta- analysis , the results indicated a reduction of 0.26 IU/mL ( 95%CI : -0.46 - 0.07 , P = 0.007 ) at  the level of ALT  and 0.53 IU/mL ( 95%CI : -0.74 - 0.32 , P = 0.000 ) at  the serum levels of AST  after using  the  silymarin , both , statistically significant , but with no clinical relevance . There was no significant  change in the γGT levels  . Subgroup analyzes were also performed for the biochemical markers in relation to the type of intervention ,  whether silymarin  isolated or associated with other nutrients and the time of intervention ( whether ≥ 6 mo or < 6 mo ) . Significant differences were not found . The evaluated studies presented a high degree of heterogeneity and low method ological quality in the carried out analysis .   Silymarin  minimally reduced , but without clinical relevance ,  the serum levels of ALT and AST  . It is necessary to carry out studies with more appropriate method ological design."
"eCancer  patients  often experience multiple distressing symptoms which are challenging to manage . It would therefore be helpful to find a treatment that alleviates more than one symptom , to avoid polypharmacy :  mirtazapine  has been used in several studies for this purpose . The objective of this study was to assess the  effectiveness and safety  of  mirtazapine  in alleviating  one or more frequently encountered cancer-related symptoms .  Systematic review of clinical trials  in English or French .  Eight data bases were search ed . Included studies assessed the effectiveness of  mirtazapine  in alleviating one or more frequently encountered  cancer-related  symptoms . Comparator and vali date d assessment tools were required . Studies were independently appraised by two investigators before data synthesis . The search yielded  1898 references  , from which we identified 12 relevant articles evaluating highly heterogeneous outcomes . These were two r and omised-controlled ( RCTs ) , three non-r and omised controlled , and seven non-r and omised non-controlled trials . In total ,  392 participants were included and 185 were in RCTs .  No study assessed the  effectiveness of  mirtazapine  in alleviating symptoms  at the same time , but some considered more than one symptom . Overall , the data was of poor quality , limited by small sample size and bias . However ,  mirtazapine  showed  effectiveness  in treating  depression , anxiety , sleep disorders , emesis and neuropathic pain .  Across all studies ,  mirtazapine  is  safe  to use , with  drowsiness and dizziness  the most common side-effects . Study design and small sample sizes limit the ability to interpret results . Trials to assess the impact of  mirtazapine  or other medicines in alleviating multiple symptoms would be valuable."
" Only one study could be included and most data were heavily skewed , almost impossible to interpret and oflow quality . There were also some limitations in the study design with unclear description of allocation concealment and high risk of bias for selective reporting , so no firm conclusions can be made . This review shows how trials in this group of people are possible - albeit difficult . Further relevant trials are needed to evaluate use of  haloperidol  in treatment of  long-term/persistent aggression  in people living with psychosis."

"sThe primary objective of this study was to analyze the most up-to- date evidence regarding whether and how  blood sugar regulation  influences cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention by carrying out an umbrella review . Three separate , systematic literature search es identified  2,343  papers in total . Overall ,  44 studies were included  for data extraction and  analysis  . The included systematic review s and meta-analyses published between January 1 , 2016 , and December 31 , 2017 , were of good to very good quality ( median Overview Quality Assessment Question naire score = 17 ) . Identified evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) prevention services should consider  regulation of  blood  glucose  as a key target for intervention . Furthermore , the recommendations for effective intervention and service development/training described here for prevention of CVD should be adopted into evidence -based practice guidelines . Multidisciplinary teams should be formed to deliver multicomponent interventions in community-based setting s. There may be substantial opportunities for integrating CVD and diabetes prevention services."
"dMusculoskeletal disorders in aging and pain are closely connected because of multiple mechanisms leading to loss of mobility and autonomy . Pain is predictive of diability and worsening frailty and the strength of this relationship increases with the severity of pain . This study presents a systematic review of r and omized controlled trials , cross sectional studies , and observational studies based on treatment of  pain in adults with musculoskeletal disorders  using  nutritional non-pharmacological ( nutrients and antioxidants ) interventions .  The review found the efficiency of the following topics : ( a ) accession of the patient to a  dietary counselling  ( e.g. , daily recommended amount of  protein-equivalent  to at least of 1  g  of  protein  per kilogram of body weight )  ;  ( b )  intake of glutamic acid-rich such as soy , egg , and cod and tryptophan-rich foods such as milk and peanuts-or taking quick-acting , free-form supplements ; (  c )  supplementation of vitamin D and magnesium  , if lacking ; ( d ) weekly  consumption of fish or supplements of omega-3 fatty acids ;  and ( e )  availability of botanicals , in particular curcumin and gingerol .  These  non-pharmacological interventions  can help the pain therapist to create a  personalized medicine  ( precision medicine ) , acting with the maximum  efficacy and safety  , and also reducing the  dosage of analgesic drugs  needed."
"0OBJECTIVE : A retrospective review of   appendectomies  performed at the University of Kansas Medical Center between January 1 , 1989 , and January 1 , 1994  , was conducted . In addition , the literature evaluating effectiveness of  incidental appendectomy  in preventing future operation and morbidity from appendicitis was review ed . The results of the two review s were analyzed to formulate guidelines for the appropriateness of performing  incidental appendectomy  in association with other operative procedures . METHOD : A retrospective review of results  of  appendectomies  performed in 460 patients at the University of Kansas Medical Center with analysis of operative findings , pathology of the removed appendix and operative complications  was performed . These results were compared with those of a systematic review of the literature utilizing a Medline search relating to the subject of incidental appendix removal . RESULTS :  Two hundred sixty-one  incidental appendectomies  were performed  in  this study of 460 patients ( 60 % ) .  The procedure was most commonly performed with total  abdominal hysterectomy  ( 56 % ) , followed by  oophorectomy  ( 15 % ) and  exploratory laparotomy  ( 11 % ) .  Morbidity  was minimal at all ages .  Microscopic pathology  was found in 25 % of the cases .  : The data from the current survey and literature review support incidental removal of the appendix in the  young patient ( < 35 years old ) .  In  patients 35 - 50 years old  the literature is controversial , and the patient 's clinical condition and judgment of the operating surgeon should determine whether  incidental appendectomy  should be performed . However , routine  incidental appendectomy  can not be justified in patients greater than age 50."
"sThis study aim ed to perform a systematic review of studies that address the influence of  physical activity  on the  quality of life  and  functional independence  of  adult individuals with spinal cord injury .  The review was performed using data obtained from the MEDLINE , CINAHL , SciELO , LILACS , SPORTD iscus , Web of Science , Academic Search Premier , and PEDro data bases using the following keywords :  quality of life ; functional independence ; autonomy  ; independence ; physical activity ; activities of  daily  living  ; physical exercise  ; tetraplegia ; paraplegia ; spinal cord injury ; physical disabilities ; and wheelchair .  Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria .  Although there was a lack of consensus among the selected studies , the majority of them presented a strong correlation between physical activity and  variables of quality of life and /or functional independence .  Thus , physical activity appears to have an important influence on  social relationships , functional independence , psychological factors , and physical aspects  , which can enhance  quality of life and independence  in the performance of daily activities."

The relation of dose to therapeutic benefit needs further exploration.
" Overall the quality of evidence is limited , poor and date d. Where drugs that have been better evaluated are available , it may be best to avoid use of  chlorpromazine .  Where  chlorpromazine  is used for acute aggression or where choices are limited , relevant trials are possible and urgently needed."
" Monotherapy with  either fibrates or statins  suggested a significantly greater effect of fibrates in  lowering plasma Fib concentrations  . According to these findings , mechanisms associated with fibrinogen metabolism might be responsible for the distinct effects  of statins and fibrates  in reducing cardiovascular endpoints."
" We found inconsistent evidence that the use of an  arm support or  an  alternative mouse  may or may not reduce the  incidence of neck or shoulder MSDs .  For other physical ergonomic interventions there is no evidence of an effect . For organisational interventions , in the form of supplementary breaks , there is very low- quality evidence of an effect on  upper limb discomfort .  For training and multifaceted interventions there is no evidence of an effect on  upper limb pain or discomfort .  Further high- quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions among office workers."
"sPatients  with ulcerative colitis , a type of inflammatory bowel disease  , report negative impacts of disease symptoms on work-related outcomes , including  absenteeism  and  presenteeism .  As a way to better underst and the impact of this disease and its treatment on work-related outcomes , the current review examines the use of the  Work  Productivity and Activity Impairment Question  naire ( WPAI )  , a patient-reported outcomes measure of absenteeism , presenteeism , and impairment in other activities , in studies of  patients with ulcerative colitis .  This review assesses the measurement properties of the  WPAI  in this patient population : its reliability , construct validity , ability to detect change , and responsiveness to effective treatments . Relevant data were extracted from 13 sources ( journal articles and conference posters ) identified following a systematic review of the published and gray literature . The evidence supports the  WPAI  as having test-retest reliability ( reproducibility ) over time ; convergent validity , as indicated by moderate correlations with measures of  quality of life  and moderate-to-strong correlations with measures of disease activity ; known-groups  validity  , as indicated by differences in  WPAI scores  between patients with active and inactive disease ; ability ( sensitivity ) to detect change , as indicated by substantial improvement in scores for patients who achieve remission , accompanied by substantial worsening of scores for patients who relapse ; and , responsiveness to treatment , with improvements in scores following treatments that reduce disease activity . Limitations included a lack of available evidence from r and omized-controlled trials that could speak more directly to the WPAI ’s responsiveness to treatment . In conclusion , we recommend the use of the  WPAI  for measuring work outcomes in both observational studies and interventional trials that include patients with ulcerative colitis."
"sHealth  risk behaviours ( HRB )  across the lifespan have been associated with higher cumulative physiological burden as measured by allostatic load ( AL ) . This study examines the contribution of HRB and their effects on multisystem biological risk associated with morbidity and early  mortality  . We systematic ally review ed the literature to assess the links between HRB and AL .  Twenty-six eligible human studies were included in  our assessment of the current literature investigating the association of different HRB that included overeating/obesity , alcohol , smoking , drug use , physical inactivity and sleep impairments in relation to AL . We found that 50 % of obesity and substance abuse , 75 % of sleep and 62.5 % of combined HRB studies showed a significant association  with AL  .  Lifestyle coping behaviours  therefore have a significant contribution to AL . This study is among the first to explore multiple domains of HRB in relation to AL . Further research should focus on evaluating  lifestyle factors that adapt HRB  as a strategy to cope with chronic stress to help decrease  AL  and result ing long-term negative health consequences."
"7Insufficient amounts of physical activity is a risk factor for ( recurrent )  stroke . People with a stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA )  have a high risk of recurrent stroke and have lower levels of physical activity than their healthy peers . Though several review s have looked at the effects of  lifestyle interventions  on a number of risk factors of recurrent stroke , the effectiveness of these interventions to increase the amounts of physical activity performed by  people with stroke or TIA  are still unclear . Therefore , the research question of this study was : what is the effect of  lifestyle interventions  on the level of  physical activity  performed by  people with stroke or TIA  ? A systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-analyses ( PRISMA ) statement . Pubmed , Embase and Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) , were search ed up to August 2018 . R and  omised  controlled trials that compared  lifestyle interventions  , aim ed to increase the amount of physical activity completed by  participants with a stroke or TIA  , with  controls  were included . The  Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) score  was used to assess the quality of the articles , and the  Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluations ( GRADE )  method for the best evidence synthesis .  Eleven trials ( n = 2403 ) met the inclusion criteria .  The  quality  of the trials was mostly high , with 8 ( 73 % ) of trials scoring ≥6 on the PEDro scale . The overall best evidence syntheses showed moderate quality evidence that lifestyle interventions do not lead to  significant improvements in the physical activity level  of  people with stroke or TIA .  There is low quality evidence that  lifestyle interventions  that specifically target physical activity are effective at  improving the levels of physical activity  of  people with stroke or TIA  . Based on the results of this review ,  general lifestyle interventions  on their own seem insufficient in  improving physical activity levels  after stroke or TIA .  Lifestyle interventions  that specifically encourage  increasing physical activity  may be more effective . Further properly powered trials using objective physical activity measures are needed to determine the effectiveness of such interventions . PROSPERO , CRD42018094437."
"eOver the past decade ,  minimally invasive surgery  has gained popularity as a means of optimising early postoperative rehabilitation and increasing patient satisfaction and cosmesis following   total  hip arthroplasty ( THA ) .  However , this surgical exposure has also been associated with increased risk of  iatrogenic nerve injury  and  implant mal-positioning  due to limited visibility compared to conventionally larger surgical incisions . The purpose of this meta- analysis was to compare the outcomes of these two surgical exposures . A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature was conducted to include all  r and omised and non-r and omised  controlled trials comparing the clinical and radiological outcomes of  minimally invasive and conventional THA procedures  .  In total , 28 studies met the eligibility criteria and included 2,849 hips , i.e. 1,428  minimally invasive  compared to 1,421  conventional THAs .   The meta- analysis of the current evidence base showed that  minimally invasive THA  is associated with a significantly  increased risk of transient lateral femoral cutaneous nerve palsy  ( p = 0.006 ) with no significantly better outcome."

"yBACKGROUND   Pain management   is integral to the management of  hip fracture .  PURPOSE To review the benefits and harms of  pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions  for managing  pain   after hip fracture .  DATA SOURCES  25 electronic  data  bases ( January 1990 to December 2010 )  , gray literature , trial registries , and reference lists , with no language restrictions . STUDY SELECTION Multiple review ers independently and in duplicate screened  9357 citations  to identify r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) ; nonr and omized , controlled trials ( non- RCTs ) ; and cohort studies of pain management techniques in  older adults after acute hip fracture .  DATA EXTRACTION Independent , duplicate data extraction and quality assessment were conducted , with discrepancies resolved by consensus or a third review er . Data extracted included study characteristics , inclusion and exclusion criteria , participant characteristics , interventions , and outcomes . DATA SYNTHESIS  83 unique studies ( 64 RCTs , 5 non- RCTs , and 14 cohort studies )  were included that addressed nerve blockade ( n = 32 ) ,  spinal anesthesia  ( n = 30 ) ,  systemic analgesia  ( n = 3 ) ,  traction  ( n = 11 ) ,  multimodal pain management  ( n = 2 ) ,  neurostimulation  ( n = 2 ) ,  rehabilitation  ( n = 1 ) , and  complementary and alternative medicine  ( n = 2 ) . Overall , moderate evidence suggests that nerve blockades are effective for  relieving acute pain and reducing delirium .  Low-level evidence suggests that preoperative traction does not reduce  acute pain .  Evidence was insufficient on the benefits and harms of most interventions , including  spinal anesthesia , systemic analgesia ,  multimodal pain management  ,  acupressure  ,  relaxation  therapy , transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation , and physical therapy regimens  , in managing acute pain . LIMITATIONS No studies evaluated outcomes of  chronic pain  or exclusively examined  participants from nursing homes or with cognitive impairment .  Systemic analgesics (  narcotics ,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs  ) were understudied during the search period .  Nerve blockade seems to be effective in reducing  acute pain  after  hip fracture  . Sparse data preclude firm conclusions about the relative benefits or harms of many other pain management interventions for  patients with hip fracture .

"DBackground :  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD )  has become prevalent in recent decades , especially in developed countries , and approaches for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD are not clear . The aim of this research was to analyze and summarize r and omized controlled trials that investigated the effects of  probiotics  on NAFLD . Methods : Seven data bases ( PubMed , Embase , the Web of Science , the Cochrane Library , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , Wan Fang Data , and VIP Data base ) were search ed . Then , eligible studies were identified . Finally , proper data extraction , synthesis and analysis were performed by trained research ers . Results :  Anthropometric parameters  : with use of  probiotics  weight was reduced by 2.31 kg , and body mass index ( BMI ) was reduced by 1.08 kg/m2 . Liver function : probiotic treatment  reduced the alanine aminotransferase level  by 7.22 U/l ,  the aspartate aminotransferase level  by 7.22 U/l ,  the alkaline phosphatase level  by 25.87 U/l ,  and the glutamyl transpeptidase level  by −5.76 U/l  . Lipid profiles : total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and triglycerides  were significantly decreased after probiotic treatment . Their overall effects ( shown as st and ard mean difference ) were −0.73 , −0.54 , and −0.36 ,  respectively  .  Plasma glucose :   probiotics   reduced the plasma glucose level by 4.45  mg/dl  and the  insulin  level  by 0.63 . Cytokines  :  probiotic treatment  decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha  by 0.62  and  leptin by  1.14 . Degree of liver fat infiltration ( DFI )  : the related risk of probiotics for restoring DFI was 2.47 ( 95 % confidence interval , 1.61–3.81 , p < 0.001 ) . Conclusion :  Probiotic treatment or supplementation  is a promising therapeutic method for NAFLD."

"sField  walking tests  are commonly employed to evaluate  exercise capacity  , assess  prognosis  and evaluate  treatment response  in  chronic respiratory diseases .  In recent years , there has been a wealth of new literature pertinent to the conduct of the  6-min walk test ( 6MWT )  , and a growing evidence base describing the incremental and  endurance shuttle walk tests  ( ISWT and ESWT , respectively ) . The aim of this document is to describe the st and ard operating procedures for the  6MWT , ISWT  and  ESWT  , which can be consistently employed by clinicians and research ers . The Technical St and ard was developed by a multidisciplinary and international group of clinicians and research ers with expertise in the application of field  walking  tests  .  The procedures are underpinned by a concurrent systematic review of literature relevant to measurement properties and test conduct in  adults with chronic respiratory disease .  Current data confirm that the  6MWT , ISWT and ESWT  are  valid , reliable and responsive  to change with some interventions . However , results are sensitive to small changes in methodology . It is important that two tests are conducted for the 6MWT and ISWT . This Technical St and ard for field walking tests reflects current evidence regarding procedures that should be used to achieve robust results."
"sCONTEXT  Prostate cancer patients , especially those on and rogen  deprivation therapy  ( ADT )  , experience many symptoms that make it difficult to maintain their independence and quality of life . Because ADT acts by means of reducing testosterone production , exercise may offset many of the ADT side effects and those of the cancer itself . OBJECTIVES This systematic review of the literature evaluates whether  exercise  could reduce  symptoms  and improve  quality of life  for  prostate cancer patients .  METHODS Using relevant data bases and key words ,  12 training studies were found  meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria . RESULTS Grade A level evidence was observed for the benefits of  exercise  in improving  muscular endurance , aerobic endurance , and overall quality of life  , as well as  reducing fatigue  in prostate cancer patients . Grade B evidence also suggested that  exercise  may improve  prostate cancer patients ' muscle mass , muscular strength , functional performance ( walking and sit to st and speed ) , as well as health-related , social and physical quality of life .  These effects appeared greater for  group-rather  than  home-based-exercise  , especially if these programs included  resistance training .   It is recommended that most  prostate cancer patients  be encouraged to exercise regularly by their clinicians and significant others . Where possible , this exercise should be group-based and include some  resistance training .  Future research in this area should directly compare group- and  home-based  , as well as  resistance , aerobic  , and  combined resistance and aerobic training  to better eluci date the most effective forms of exercise for this population and what factors affect initiation and adherence to such programs."
"sThere is substantial interest in the therapeutic potential of  cannabidiol ( CBD )  , a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid found in plants of the genus Cannabis . The goal of the current systematic review was to characterize the existing literature on this topic and to evaluate the credibility of  CBD  as a c and i date pharmacotherapy for  alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) .  Using a comprehensive search strategy ,  303 unique potential articles were identified and 12 ultimately met criteria for inclusion ( 8 using rodent models , 3 using healthy adult volunteers , and 1 using cell culture ) .  In both rodent and cell culture models ,  CBD  was found to exert a neuroprotective  effect  against adverse alcohol consequences on the hippocampus . In rodent models ,  CBD  was found to attenuate  alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity  , specifically , alcohol-induced steatosis . Finally , findings from pre clinical rodent models also indicate that  CBD  attenuates  cue-elicited and stress-elicited alcohol seeking , alcohol self-administration , withdrawal-induced convulsions , and impulsive discounting of delayed rewards .  In human studies ,  CBD  was  well tolerated  and did  not interact with the subjective effects of alcohol .  Collectively , given its favorable effects on  alcohol-related harms and addiction phenotypes  in pre clinical models ,  CBD  appears to have promise as a c and i date AUD pharmacotherapy . This is further bolstered by the absence of abuse liability and its general tolerability . A clear limitation to the literature is the paucity of human investigations . Human pre clinical and clinical studies are needed to determine whether these positive effects in model systems substantively translate into clinical ly relevant outcomes."

"sObjectives : To summarise quantitatively the available evidence relating to pretraumatic , peritraumatic and posttraumatic characteristics that may increase or decrease the risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD )  following spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .  Study design : Systematic review . Methods :  Seventeen studies were identified from the PubMed ,  PsycInfo  , Embase , Scopus , CINAHL , Web  of Science and PILOTS  data  bases .  Effect  size  estimates  ( r ) with associated  95  %  confidence intervals  (  CIs  ) ,  P-values  and  fail-safe  Ns were calculated . Results : Individual studies reported medium-to-large associations between factors that occurred before ( psychiatric history r=0.48 ( 95 % CI , 0.23–0.79 ) P=0.01 ) or at the time of injury ( tetraplegia r=−0.36 ( 95 % CI , −0.50 to −0.19 ) P<0.01 ) . Postinjury factors had the strongest pooled effects  : depressed mood  ( rw=0.64 , ( 95 % CI , 0.54–0.72 ) )  , negative appraisal  s ( rw=0.63 ( 95 % CI , 0.52–0.72 )  ) , distress  ( rw=0.57 ( 95 % CI , 0.50–0.62 )  ) , anxiety  ( rw=0.56 ( 95 % CI , 0.49–0.61 )  ) and pain severity  ( rw=0.35 ( 95 % CI , 0.27–0.43 ) ) were consistently related to  worsening PTSD  symptoms ( P<0.01 )  . Level of injury  significantly correlated  with current PTSD severity  for veteran population s ( QB (1)=18.25 , P<0.001 ) , although this was based on limited data . Conclusion : Combinations of peri- and post-injury factors appear to be influential in the development of PTSD among  persons with SCI .  Further studies are needed to extrapolate these findings to the broader spinal  cord-injured population  . More longitudinal research , driven by multicausal models of causation such as the diathesis-stress model , is also needed to determine the temporality of PTSD risk factors."
"TBackground  Total hip or knee arthroplasty  is an elective procedure that is usually accompanied by substantial blood loss , which may lead to acute anemia . As a result , almost half of  total joint arthroplasty patients receive  allogeneic blood transfusions ( ABT ) .   Many studies have shown that  post-operative auto-transfusion ( PAT )  significantly reduces the need for   ABT   , but other studies have question ed the efficacy of this method . Methods The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information ; see Checklist S1 . To evaluate the  efficacy  of  PAT  , we conducted a Cochrane systematic review that combined all available data from r and omized controlled trials . Data from the  six  included trials were pooled for analysis . We then calculated relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences with 95 % CIs for continuous outcomes . Findings and Conclusion To our knowledge , this is the first meta- analysis to compare the clinical results between  PAT  and a  control  in  joint replacement patients .  This meta- analysis has proven that the use of a  PAT  reinfusion system reduced significantly  the dem and for ABT , the number of patients who require ABT and the cost of hospitalization  after total knee and hip arthroplasty . This study , together with other previously published data , suggests that  PAT drains  are beneficial . Larger , sufficiently powered studies are necessary to evaluate the presumed reduction in the  incidence of infection  as well as  DVT  after joint arthroplasty with the use of PAT."

"0OBJECTIVE To present the essential guidelines for  non-pharmacological management  of  patients with psychomotor agitation in Brazil .  METHODS These guidelines were developed based on a systematic review of articles  published from 1997 to 2017  , retrieved from MEDLINE ( PubMed ) , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review , and SciELO . Other relevant articles identified by search ing the reference lists of included studies were also used to develop these guidelines . The search strategy used structured questions formulated using the PICO model , as recommended by the Guidelines Project of the Brazilian Medical Association . Recommendations were summarized according to their level of evidence , which was determined using the Oxford Centre for Evidence -based Medicine system and critical appraisal tools . RESULTS  We initially selected 1,731 abstract s among 5,362 articles . The final sample included 104 articles that fulfilled all the inclusion criteria .  The management of  agitated patients  should always start with the least  coercive  approach . The initial  non-pharmacological  measures include a  verbal strategy and referral of the patient  to the appropriate setting , preferably a facility design ed for the care of psychiatric patients with controlled noise , lighting , and safety aspects . Verbal de-escalation techniques have been shown to decrease agitation and reduce the potential for  associated violence  in the emergency setting . The possibility of underlying medical etiologies must be considered first and foremost . Particular attention should be paid to the  patient 's appearance and behavior , physical signs , and mental state .  If  agitation  is severe , rapid  tranquilization  with medications is recommended . Finally , if verbal measures fail to contain the patient , physical restraint should be performed as the ultimate measure for patient protection , and always be accompanied by  rapid tranquilization .  Healthcare teams must be thoroughly trained to use these techniques and overcome difficulties if the verbal approach fails . It is important that healthcare professionals be trained in  non-pharmacological management  of  patients with psychomotor agitation  as part of the requirements for a degree and graduate degree .  The  non-pharmacological  management of  agitated patients  should follow the hierarchy of less invasive to more invasive and coercive measures , starting with referral of the patient to an appropriate environment , management by a trained team , use of verbal techniques , performance of physical and mental assessment , use of medications , and , if unavoidable , use of the mechanical restraint .

" Short-term ( 4–12 weeks )  supplementation with vitamin D  is associated with  lower fasting glucose levels  in ESRD with no change in  fasting  insulin levels . However , the findings from this study are limited by the studies that were used in the meta- analysis , which were mostly small , used multiple different vitamin D compounds and dosing regimens , and had large heterogeneity , and funnel plots showed that there was a dearth of studies with null or negative finding . Therefore , larger RCTs need to be performed to answer this important clinical question."
"sOBJECTIVE This study aim ed to verify whether the  saddle seat  provides lower  ergonomic risk  than  conventional seats  in dentistry . METHODS This review followed the PRISMA statement and a protocol was created and registered in PROSPERO ( CRD42017074918 ) . Six electronic data bases were search ed as primary study sources . The "" grey literature "" was included to prevent selection and publication biases . The risk of bias among the studies included was assessed with the  Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for Systematic Review  s. Meta- analysis was performed to estimate the  effect  of  seat type  on the  ergonomic risk score  in dentistry . The heterogeneity among studies was assessed using I2 statistics . RESULTS The search result ed  in 3147 records , from which two were considered eligible for this review .  Both studies were conducted with a  total of 150 second-year dental students who were starting their laboratory activities using phantom heads .   Saddle seats  were associated with a significantly  lower ergonomic risk  than  conventional seats  [ right side ( mean difference = -3.18 ; 95 % CI = -4.96 , -1.40 ; p < 0.001 ) and left side ( mean difference = -3.12 ; 95 % CI = -4.56 , -1.68 ; p < 0.001 ) ] , indicating posture improvement .  The two eligible studies for this review provide moderate evidence that  saddle seats  provided  lower ergonomic risk  than  conventional seats  in the examined population of dental students."
"eThis systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to evaluate the  survival rate  of   ceramic and resin inlays , onlays , and overlays   and to identify the complication types associated with the main clinical outcomes . Two review ers search ed PubMed , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  for articles published between 1983 through April 2015  , conforming to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines for  systematic review  s. Clinical studies meeting the following criteria were included : 1 )  studies related to  resin and ceramic inlays  ,  onlays  ,  and  overlays  ;  2 ) prospect  i  ve , retrospective , or r  and  omized controlled trials  conducted  in humans ; 3 ) studies with a dropout rate of less than 30 % ; and 4 ) studies with a follow-up longer than 5 y. Of 1,389 articles , 14 met the inclusion criteria .  The meta-regression indicated that the type of ceramic material ( feldspathic  porcelain  vs.  glass-ceramic  ) , study design ( retrospective vs. prospect i ve ) , follow-up time ( 5 vs. 10 y ) , and study setting ( university vs. private clinic ) did not affect the survival rate .  Estimated survival rates  for  glass-ceramics  and  feldspathic  porcelain were between 92 % and 95 % at 5 y ( n = 5,811 restorations ) and were 91 % at 10 y ( n = 2,154 restorations ) .  Failures  were related to  fractures/chipping  ( 4 % ) , followed by  endodontic complications  ( 3 % ) ,  secondary caries  ( 1 % ) ,  debonding  ( 1 % ) , and  severe marginal staining  ( 0 % ) .

"sThe objective of this study was to perform a systematic review on training outcomes influencing  physical fitness , activity of daily living performance , and quality -of-life  in  institutionalized older people .  We review ed  27 studies on older people ( age , ≥70 yrs ) in long-term care facilities and nursing homes .  Our ultimate goal was to propose criteria for an evidence -based exercise protocol aim ed at improving  physical fitness , activity of daily living performance , and quality -of-life  of  frail institutionalized older people .  The interventions , described in the review ed studies that showed strong or very strong effect sizes were used to form an exercise prescription . The conclusion is that there is firm evidence for training effects  on physical fitness , functional performance , activity of daily living performance , and quality -of-life .  The  training should contain a combination of progressive resistance training , balance training , and functional training .  The proposed intensity is moderate to high , assessed on a 0 - 10 scale for muscle strengthening activities .

"tAbstract The introduction of  new technologies for diagnosis  and  screening  programs led to an increasing rate of early detection of  colorectal cancer .  This , associated with the evolution of  endoscopic techniques of local excision  , led to the assessment of new strategies to reduce morbidity related to treatment , especially for early rectal cancer ( ERC ) . Nevertheless , the definition of ERC and its staging and treatment algorithm are still under debate . The Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery developed practice guidelines to provide recommendations on the  diagnosis , staging and treatment of ERC .  A systematic review on the topic was performed by a multidisciplinary group of experts selected based on their clinical and scientific expertise in  endoscopy , endoscopic ultrasound , magnetic resonance and surgery  , with the aid of an external international audit."
"eSTUDY QUESTION Does   fertility treatment   influence  cognitive ability  in  school aged children  , and does the impact vary with the type of treatment ? SUMMARY ANSWER The available high- quality evidence indicates that specific treatments may give rise to different effects on  cognitive development  , with certain treatments , including  ICSI  , associated with  cognitive impairment .  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Previous review s of the literature concerning  cognitive outcomes  among  children conceived with medical assistance  have concluded that study findings are generally ' reassuring ' , but limited attention has been paid to the quality of this research . In addition , no review has separately assessed the range of treatment modalities available , which vary in invasiveness , and thus , potentially , in their effects on developmental outcomes . STUDY DESIGN , SIZE , DURATION A systematic review was undertaken . We search ed PubMed , PsycINFO and the Educational Re sources Information Centre data base to identify  English- language studies published up until 21 November 2016 .  PARTICIPANTS / MATERIAL S , SETTING , METHODS Two authors independently review ed identified articles , extracted data and assessed study quality .  Studies were eligible if they assessed  cognitive development  from age 4 years or more , among children conceived with  fertility treatment  compared with either children conceived naturally or children born from a different type  of fertility treatment .   Where available , data were extracted and reported separately according to the various components of treatment ( e.g. mode of fertilization , embryo freezing , etc . ) . Risk of bias was assessed using the  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale  , with a score ≥7/9 indicative of high quality . MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The search identified  861 articles , of which 35 were included .  Of these ,  seven were rated high quality .  Most studies ( n = 22 ) were subject to selection bias , due to the exclusion of children at increased risk of cognitive impairment . Among high- quality studies , there was no difference  in cognitive outcomes  among children conceived with conventional IVF and those conceived naturally . Findings among high- quality studies of children conceived with ICSI were inconsistent : when compared with children conceived naturally , one study reported  lower intelligence quotient  ( IQ ; 5 - 7 points , on average ) among ICSI children whereas the remaining two high- quality studies reported no difference between groups . Furthermore , among the three high- quality studies comparing children conceived with ICSI compared with conventional IVF , one reported a significant  increase in the risk of mental retardation  , one reported a  small difference in IQ  ( 3 points lower , on average ) and one no difference at all . There were scant studies examining exposure to embryo freezing , or less invasive treatments such as ovulation induction without IVF/ICSI . LIMITATION , REASONS FOR CAUTION Most existing studies had method ological limitations including selection bias and /or failure to address confounding by family background . In addition , a meta- analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in the assessment of  cognitive  outcomes . These factors impeded our ability to synthesize the evidence and draw reliable conclusions . WIDER IMPLICATION S OF THE FINDINGS The conflicting findings among studies of  children conceived with  ICSI   require clarification , in light of the increasing use of this technique for reasons other than male-factor infertility . Further population -based studies are needed that utilize contemporary data to examine specific aspects of treatment and combinations of techniques ( e.g.  ICSI  with frozen embryo cycles ) . Importantly , studies should include the complete group of children exposed to treatment .

"nBackground Subacromial  shoulder  pain is a common clinical presentation with much diagnostic uncertainty . Some of this uncertainty relates to the involvement of the cervical spine as a source or contribution to subacromial shoulder pain . Currently , there is no accepted method of screening of the cervical spine in the presence of subacromial shoulder pain , which risks patients receiving misguided and /or ineffective interventions . Objective To evaluate approaches used to screen the cervical spine in  patients with subacromial shoulder pain .  Design Systematic review of r and omized controlled trials . Methods Electronic search es of PEDro and MEDLINE to December 2016 were conducted . R and omized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of interventions within the current scope of physiotherapy comprising of  adult patients complaining of subacromial shoulder pain  were included . Data relating to the method of  cervical spine screening  were extracted and synthesized categorically . Results  One hundred and two studies were included .  Twenty-six ( 25.5 % ) were categorized as “ No method of screening undertaken or reported , ” 49 ( 48.0 % ) were categorized as “ Localized cervical spine symptoms and /or radiculopathy/radicular pain , ” nine ( 8.8 % ) were categorized as “  Cervical examination  , ” two ( 2.0 % ) were categorized as “  Manual  testing , ” two ( 2.0 % ) were categorized as “ History of  cervical surgery  , ” and 14 ( 13.7 % ) were categorized as using “ Combined approaches . ” Conclusion Examination of the cervical spine in  patients with subacromial shoulder pain  is variable in r and omized controlled trials . In many instances , no or minimal attempts to screen were undertaken or reported . This has potential research and management implication s and further research is indicated to facilitate development of this aspect of examination."

 These results suggest that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no differences in  efficacy  between  SSRIs  and  placebo  in the treatment of  depression in PD .  Due to the limited number of studies and the small sample sizes a type II error ( false negative ) can not be excluded . The comparison between  SSRIs  and  TCAs  is based on only three studies and further trials with more pragmatic design are needed.
"sAim / objective The objective of this study was to provide a meta- analysis examining the effects of  football heading .  Design Meta-analytical review on  football  heading effects on neurocognitive performance , cognition and symptom reports . Data sources Combinations of the key terms were entered into the following electronic data base search engines : Cochrane Libraries , PyscARTICLE , PyscINFO , PubMed , ProQuest , SPORTD iscus and Web of Science on 7 July 2016 . Eligibility criteria for selecting studies The following inclusion criteria were used to determine eligibility for  studies : ( 1 ) the study examined and reported on soccer athletes ; ( 2 ) the population 's age , sex and sport position was described ; ( 3 ) cognitive function , symptoms  ,  balance or other outcomes were quantitatively measured ; ( 4 ) football heading exposure was quantitatively measured between at least two groups and ( 5 ) the study was written in the English language after December 1979 .

"nBackground and aims  The Nordic diet ( ND )  , is supposed to be associated with a reduced  cardiovascular risk ;  however , clinical trials have led to inconsistent results regarding the effect of this diet on  cardio-metabolic markers .  Using systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , this study aim ed to investigate the effect of the  ND  on  circulating levels of total , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , and triglyceride ( TG )  , as well as  blood pressure  in  human adults .  Methods PubMed , Scopus , ISI Web of Science , and Google Scholar were search ed up to February 2018 for relevant articles . R and om effects model was used to estimate the overall effects . Results  Five RCTs consisting of 513 participants were included  in the present review . The meta- analysis of five eligible studies showed that  ND  significantly reduces  the total  [ weighted mean difference ( WMD ) = − 0.38 mmol/l , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) − 0.76 , − 0.01 , P =  0.044  ]  and LDL cholesterol  ( WMD = − 0.30 mmol/l , 95 % CI − 0.54 , − 0.06 , P = 0.013 ) levels compared with the control groups ; however , none was seen  for HDL cholesterol and TG levels .  The meta- analysis of four eligible RCTs revealed that  the ND  significantly  reduces the systolic  ( WMD = − 3.97 mmHg , 95 % CI − 6.40 , − 1.54 , P =  0.001 ) and diastolic blood pressure  ( WMD = − 2.08 mmHg , 95 % CI − 3.43 , − 0.72 , P = 0.003 ) . Conclusion The  Nordic dietary pattern   improves blood pressure  and  also some of blood lipid markers  and it should be considered as a healthy dietary pattern."
"SBackground Research has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of  weight management , dietary and physical activity interventions  in  military  setting s. However , a recent and comprehensive overview is lacking . The aim of this systematic review is to examine the evidence and describe key components of effective interventions in terms of  improving body composition , dietary behaviors , and physical activity  among  active-duty military personnel .  Methods PubMed , PsycInfo , and CINAHL were search ed on the 17th of November 2017 to identify interventions that promoted diet and /or physical activity among  active-duty military personnel .  Studies were included if they assessed outcomes related to  anthropometric measurements , dietary behaviors , or fitness/physical activity levels .  There were no restrictions regarding publication date , follow-up duration , and sex . After screening ,  a total of 136 studies were eligible .  Of these studies ,  38 included an   educational and /or behavioral change  component   ,  and 98 had only physical or fitness training as part of basic military training .  Only studies that included an educational  and  /or  behavioral change component  were assessed for quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool and included in the qualitative synthesis of the results . Results Based on consistent evidence from studies that were rated as moderate or strong , there is good evidence that military weight management interventions are effective in improving  body composition  for duration s of up to 12 months . Effective interventions are more likely to be high intensity ( have a greater number of sessions ) , are more often delivered by specialists , and use theoretical base/behavioral change techniques and a st and ardized guideline . Dietary interventions can potentially reduce  total fat and saturated fat intake .   Dietary interventions  that target the kitchen staff and /or increase the availability of  healthy  food are more likely to be effective in the short term . The results regarding military physical fitness interventions were inconclusive . Conclusion Despite limitations such as the diversity and heterogeneity of the included interventions , outcome measurements , and follow-up duration , this systematic review found good evidence that weight management interventions are effective , especially in terms of  weight loss .  More studies are needed to acquire solid evidence for effectiveness for duration s longer than 12 months and to identify key components of the  effective dietary and physical activity educational and /or behavioral change interventions  , especially in countries outside Europe and the US."
"eBackground  Postoperative delirium  is a common preventable complication experienced by  older adults undergoing elective surgery .  In this systematic review and meta- analysis , we identified prognostic factors associated with the risk of  postoperative  delirium   among  older adults undergoing elective surgery .  Methods Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and AgeLine were search ed for  articles published between inception and April 21 , 2016 .  A total of  5692 titles and abstract s  were screened in duplicate for possible inclusion . Studies using any method for diagnosing delirium were eligible . Two review ers independently completed all data extraction and quality assessment s using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and the  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale  ( NOS ) for cohort studies . R and om effects meta- analysis models were used to derive pooled effect estimates . Results  Forty-one studies ( 9384 patients )  reported  delirium-related prognostic factors  . Among our included studies , the  pooled incidence of postoperative delirium  was 18.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 14.3–23.3 % , number needed to follow [ NNF ] = 6 ) . Geriatric syndromes were important predictors of delirium , namely  history of delirium  ( odds ratio [ OR ] 6.4 , 95 % CI 2.2–17.9 ) ,  frailty  ( OR 4.1 , 95 % CI 1.4–11.7 ) ,  cognitive impairment  ( OR 2.7 , 95 % CI 1.9–3.8 ) ,  impairment in activities of daily living  ( ADLs ; OR 2.1 , 95 % CI 1.6–2.6 ) , and  impairment in instrumental activities of daily living  ( IADLs ; OR 1.9 , 95 % CI 1.3–2.8 ) . Potentially modifiable prognostic factors such as psychotropic  medication  use ( OR 2.3 , 95 % CI 1.4–3.6 ) and  smoking  status ( OR 1.8 95 % CI 1.3–2.4 ) were also identified .  Caregiver  support was associated with lower odds  of postoperative delirium  ( OR 0.69 , 95 % CI 0.52–0.91 ) . Discussion Though caution must be used in interpreting meta-analyses of non-r and omized studies due to the potential influence of unmeasured confounding , we identified potentially modifiable prognostic factors including frailty and psychotropic medication use that should be targeted to optimize care."
"yIt is often assumed that  patients with pain-related disability due to low back pain ( LBP )  will have reduced physical activity levels , but recent studies have provided results that challenge this assumption . The aim of our systematic review was to examine the relationship between   physical activity   and  disability  in LBP . The literature search included  6 electronic data bases and  the  reference list of relevant systematic  review s  and studies to May 2010 .  To be included , studies had to measure both  disability  ( eg , with the Rol and Morris Disability Question naire ) and  physical  activity   ( eg , by  accelerometry )  in  patients with non-specific LBP .  Two independent review ers screened search results and extracted data , and authors were contacted for additional data . Correlation coefficients were pooled using the r and om-effects model .  The search identified 3213 records and 18 studies were eligible for inclusion .  The pooled results showed a weak relationship  between physical activity and disability  in acute or subacute ( < 3months ) LBP ( r=-0.08 , 95 % confidence interval=-0.17 to 0.002 ) , and a moderate and negative relationship in chronic ( > 3months ) LBP ( r=-0.33 , 95 % confidence interval=-0.51 to -0.15 ) . That is , persons with acute or subacute LBP appear to vary in the  levels of physical activity independent  of  their pain-related disability .   Persons with chronic LBP  with high levels of  disability  are also likely to have low  levels of physical activity .   Persons with  acute  or  subacute back pain appear to vary in the  levels of physical activity independent of disability .   Persons with chronic back pain  with high levels of  disability  will likely have low levels of physical activity."

"sMany public health interventions provide benefits that extend beyond their direct recipients and impact people in close physical or social proximity who did not directly receive the intervention themselves . A classic example of this phenomenon is the herd protection provided by many vaccines . If these ' spillover effects ' ( i.e. ' herd effects ' ) are present in the same direction as the effects on the intended recipients , studies that only estimate direct effects on recipients will likely underestimate the full public health benefits of the intervention . Causal inference assumptions for spillover parameters have been articulated in the vaccine literature , but many studies measuring spillovers of other types of public health interventions have not drawn upon that literature . In conjunction with a systematic review we conducted of spillovers of public health interventions delivered in  low- and middle-income countries  , we classified the most widely used spillover parameters reported in the empirical literature into a st and ard notation . General classes of spillover parameters include :  cluster-level spillovers ; spillovers conditional on treatment or outcome density , distance or the number of treated social network links ;  and  vaccine efficacy parameters related to spillovers .  We draw on high quality empirical examples to illustrate each of these parameters . We describe study design s to estimate spillovers and assumptions required to make causal inferences about spillovers . We aim to advance and encourage methods for spillover estimation and reporting by st and ardizing spillover parameter nomenclature and articulating the causal inference assumptions required to estimate spillovers."

"sBACKGROUND Currently , there is no evidence -based definition for concussion that is being uniformly applied in clinical and research setting s. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of the highest- quality literature about concussion and to assemble evidence about the prevalence and associations of key indicators of concussion . The goal was to establish an evidence -based foundation from which to derive , in future work , a definition , diagnostic criteria , and prognostic indicators for concussion . METHODS Key questions were developed , and an electronic literature search from  1980 to 2012  was conducted to acquire evidence about the prevalence of and associations among signs , symptoms , and neurologic and cognitive deficits in  sample s of individuals exposed to potential concussive events .  Included studies were assessed for potential for bias and confound and rated as high , medium , or low potential for bias and confound . Those rated as high were excluded from the analysis . Studies were further triaged on the basis of whether the definition of a case of concussion was exclusive or inclusive ; only those with wide , inclusive case definitions were used in the analysis . Finally , only studies reporting data collected at fixed time points were used . For a study to be included in the conclusions , it was required that the presence of any particular sign , symptom , or deficit be reported in at least 2 independent sample s. RESULTS From  5437 abstract s , 1362 full-text publications were review ed  , of  which 231 studies were included in the  final library  .  Twenty-six met all criteria required to be used in the analysis , and of those , 11  independent  sample s from 8 publications directly contributed data to conclusions . Prevalent and consistent indicators of concussion are ( 1 )  observed and documented disorientation or confusion immediately after the event  , ( 2 )  impaired balance within 1 day after injury ,  ( 3 )  slower reaction time within 2 days after injury  , and  /or  ( 4 )  impaired verbal learning and memory  within 2 days after injury .  The results of this systematic review identify the consistent and prevalent indicators of concussion and their associations , derived from the strongest evidence in the published literature . The product is an evidence -based foundation from which to develop diagnostic criteria and prognostic indicators."
"nAim The purpose of this work is to give practical guidelines for radiotherapy of  locally advanced , inflammatory and metastatic breast cancer at first presentation .  Methods A comprehensive survey of the literature using the search phrases  “ locally advanced breast cancer ”  ,  “ inflammatory breast cancer ”  ,  “ breast cancer and synchronous metastases ” , “ de novo stage IV and breast cancer ” ,  and  “ metastatic breast cancer ”  and  “ at first presentation  ” restricted to “ clinical trials ” , “ r and omized trials ” , “ meta- analysis ” , “ systematic review ” , and “ guideline ” was performed and supplemented by using references of the respective publications . Based on the German interdisciplinary S3 guidelines , up date d in 2012 , this publication addresses indications , sequence to other therapies , target volumes , dose , and fractionation of  radiotherapy .  Results International and national guidelines are in agreement that locally advanced , at least if regarded primarily unresectable  and inflammatory breast  cancer should receive  neoadjuvant systemic therapy first  ,  followed by surgery and radiotherapy .  If surgery is not amenable after systemic therapy ,  radiotherapy  is the treatment of choice followed by  surgery  , if possible .  Surgery  and  radiotherapy  should be administered independent of response to neoadjuvant systemic treatment . In  patients with a de novo diagnosis of breast cancer with synchronous distant metastases  ,  surgery  and  radiotherapy  result in considerably better  locoregional tumor control .  An improvement in  survival  has not been consistently proven , but may exist in subgroups of patients .  Conclusion Radiotherapy  is an important part in the treatment of locally advanced and  inflammatory  breast cancer that should be given to all patients regardless to the intensity and effect of neoadjuvant systemic treatment and the extent of surgery .  Locoregional radiotherapy  in patients with primarily distant metastatic disease should be prescribed on an individual basis .

"lThe purpose of this quantitative systematic review was to appraise the evidence on the   caries-preventive effect  of  glass ionomer cement ( GIC )  in relation  to   resin-based fissure sealants .  Nine English and two Portuguese data bases were search ed ( 15 January 2008 ) . R and omized clinical  trials and systematic review s were considered for inclusion . Trial exclusion criteria were  : drop-out rates > 33 % ; no r and omization ; baseline differences in groups not statistically adjusted ; and no clinical ly important outcomes were presented .  Two authors review ed the articles independently . The outcome measure for the  caries preventive effect was caries absence on sealed teeth .  Of  the 112 identified articles , 25 were selected for review .  Of these , 14 were excluded and 11 accepted ( 8 trials ; 3 systematic review s ) . The accepted review s provided no evidence of superiority of either sealant material . Six trials were included for meta- analysis . The  pooled odds ratio  was 0.96 , 95 % CI 0.62 - 1.49 , indicating no difference in the  caries-preventive effect  of  GIC and resin-based fissure sealant material .  This systematic review with meta- analysis found no evidence that either material was  superior  to the other in  the prevention of dental caries .  Thus , both material s appear equally suitable for clinical application as a fissure sealant material."

However , larger-scale , more method ologically robust , community-based studies with longer follow-up times are needed to establish whether such techniques can have a long-term impact on eating patterns .

")The aim of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of  body fat distribution  before and after  partial and complete weight restoration  in  individuals with anorexia nervosa .  Literature search es , study selection , method development and quality appraisal were performed independently by two authors , and data was synthesized using a narrative approach .  Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria and were consequently analyzed .  The review had five main findings . First , during  anorexia nervosa adolescent females  lose more  central body fat  , while adult females more peripheral fat  .  Second , partial weight restoration leads to greater  fat mass deposition  in the trunk region than other body regions in adolescent females . Third , after short-term weight restoration , whether partial or complete , adults show a  central adiposity phenotype  with respect to healthy age-matched controls . Fourth , central fat distribution is associated with increased  insulin  resistance , but does not adversely affect  eating disorder psychopathology  or cause  psychological distress  in female adults . Fifth , the  abnormal central fat distribution  seems to normalize after long-term maintenance of complete weight restoration , indicating that preferential central distribution of body fat is a transitory phenomenon . However , a discrepancy in the findings has been noted , especially between adolescents and adults ; besides age and gender , these appear to be related to differences in the methodology and time of body composition assessment s.

"eINTRODUCTION Obesity is a top public health priority but interventions to reverse the condition have had limited success . About one-in-three  obese adults  are free of metabolic risk factor clustering and are considered ' healthy ' , and much attention has focused on the implication s of this state for obesity management . Areas covered : We search ed for individual studies , systematic review s , and meta-analyses which examined correlates and outcomes of metabolically healthy obesity . We discuss the key roles of fat distribution and physical activity in determining healthy vs. unhealthy obesity and report a greatly increased risk of  incident type 2 diabetes  associated with healthy obesity vs. healthy normal weight , among other outcomes . We argue that despite inconsistencies in the definition , patterns across studies clearly show that healthy obesity is a state of intermediate disease risk . Expert commentary : Given the current state of population -level evidence , we conclude that obesity and metabolic dysfunction are inseparable and that  healthy obesity  is best viewed only as a state of relative health but not of absolute health . We recommend that   weight loss through energy restriction   be a st and -alone target in addition to increased physical activity for minimising risk of future disease."
