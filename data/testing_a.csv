"tINTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND An individual  patient data meta  analysis was performed to determine clinical outcomes , and to propose a risk stratification system , related to the comprehensive treatment of  patients with oligometastatic NSCLC .  MATERIAL S AND METHODS After a systematic review of the literature , data were obtained on  757 NSCLC patients with 1 to 5 synchronous or metachronous metastases treated with  surgical metastectomy , stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery , or radical external-beam radiotherapy , and curative treatment  of the primary lung cancer , from hospitals worldwide .  Factors predictive of  overall survival ( OS )  and  progression-free survival  were evaluated using Cox regression . Risk groups were defined using recursive partitioning analysis ( RPA ) . Analyses were conducted on training and validating sets ( two-thirds and one-third of patients , respectively ) . RESULTS  Median OS  was 26 months , 1-year OS 70.2 % , and 5-year OS 29.4 % . Surgery was the most commonly used treatment for the primary tumor ( 635 patients [ 83.9 % ] ) and metastases ( 339 patients [ 62.3 % ] ) . Factors predictive of  OS  were :  synchronous versus metachronous metastases  ( P < .001 ) , N-stage ( P = .002 ) , and  adenocarcinoma histology  ( P = .036 ) ; the model remained predictive in the validation set ( c-statistic = 0.682 ) . In RPA , 3 risk groups were identified : low-risk , metachronous metastases ( 5-year OS , 47.8 % ) ; intermediate risk , synchronous metastases and N0 disease ( 5-year OS , 36.2 % ) ; and high risk , synchronous metastases and N1/N2 disease ( 5-year OS , 13.8 % ) .  Significant  OS differences  were observed in  oligometastatic patients  stratified according to type of metastatic presentation , and N status .  Long-term survival  is common in selected patients with metachronous oligometastases . We propose this risk classification scheme be used in guiding selection of patients for clinical trials of ablative treatment."
"eAdjuvant  chemotherapy  is associated with increased overall survival in  non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC )  , but is associated with high- grade  toxicity  . The effect of  cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy  on non-lung cancer-related mortality is not well investigated . We conducted a systematic review and a study -level meta- analysis of published r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) in order to determine the overall risk of non-lung cancer-related mortality associated with  adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy  in NSCLC . PubMed was search ed to identify relevant studies . Eligible publications included prospect i  ve  RCTs in which  cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy plus local therapy  was  compared with local therapy alone  in NSCLC .  Summary incidence rates , relative risks ( RRs ) , and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs )  were calculated using fixed- or r and om-effects models . Primary endpoint was  non-lung cancer-related mortality risk ( due to cardiovascular , respiratory or second malignancy deaths for example )  , and secondary endpoints were  chemotherapy-related , second primary tumor-related , cardiovascular-related , and unknown cause mortalities .   A total of 6,430 patients with NSCLC from 16 RCTs were included in the analysis .  Compared with  no chemotherapy  , the use of  cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy  was associated with an increased  risk of non-lung cancer-related death  , with an RR of 1.30 ( 95 % CI 1.1–1.53 ; P = 0.002 ; incidence , 9.3 vs. 7.2 % ; absolute difference 2 %  ) . Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy  was also associated with a  greater risk of chemotherapy-related mortality  ( RR 2.16 , 95 % CI 1.15–4.06 ; P = 0.02 ) . Second  primary tumor-related mortality and cardiovascular-related mortality  were similar . In this meta- analysis of RCTs in NSCLC  , cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy  was associated with a 30 % increase in  non-lung cancer-related mortality  compared with local therapy alone."
"sBackground  Low rectal cancer  is conventionally managed with  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) followed by radical surgery ( RS ) .  In  patients who refuse a stoma or are unfit for RS  , an alternative approach may be the use of  pre-op CRT and local excision ( LE )  where tumours are responsive . The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether differences exist in  local recurrence ( LR ) , overall survival ( OS ) and disease-free ( DFS ) survival  between  patients treated with  CRT + LE  and  CRT + RS  .  Methods A literature search was performed using MEDLINE / PubMed /Ovid data bases and Google Scholar between  1946 and 2013 .  Studies comparing outcome following  LE and RS  post-CRT were included . A pooled analysis was carried out using the Mantel-Haenszel statistical ( r and om effects ) model to identify differences in  LR , OS and DFS  between CRT  +  LE and CRT + RS . Results  Eight  studies were suitable for pooled analyses of  LR  whereas five and four studies were analysed for  OS and DFS  , respectively . When  RS  was used as the reference group ,  LR rate  was higher in the LE group . However , this was non-significant ( odds ratio ( OR ) 1.29 , confidence interval ( CI ) 0.72–2.31 , p = 0.40 ) . Similarly , no difference was observed  in 10-year OS  ( OR 0.96 , CI 0.38–2.43 , p = 0.93 ) or  5-year DFS  ( OR 1.04 , CI 0.61–1.76 , p = 0.89 ) . There was evidence of publication bias in studies used for  DFS  . Subgroup analysis of above outcomes in T3/any N stage cancers showed no difference in LE versus RS . Conclusion In the current evidence synthesis , there was no statistical difference in the  LR , OS and DFS rates  observed between  patients treated with  LE  and RS for rectal cancer post-CRT  .  LE  post-CRT may represent a viable alternative to  RS  for some patients wishing to avoid RS . However , further r and omised studies are required to confirm these results."
" There is low- to moderate- quality evidence that  RTT   improves upper and lower limb function ;  improvements were sustained up to six months post treatment . Further research should focus on the type and amount of training , including ways of measuring the  number of  repetitions actually performed by participants . The definition of  RTT  will need revisiting prior to further up date s of this review in order to ensure it remains clinical ly meaningful and distinguishable from other interventions."
"dThis paper summarises Effective Health Care , volume 6 , number 2,1 which is based on a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to promote the initiation of  breast feeding.2  Breast feeding is a key public health issue . Health benefits associated with breast feeding include protection against  gastroenteritis , respiratory infection , otitis media , urinary tract infections  , and  diabetes mellitus  for the infant3 and premenopausal  breast  ,  ovarian  , and  endometrial cancers  for the mother.4 These health benefits may be countered by some concern over pathogen transmission through breast feeding , for example , in the case of HIV.5 Despite national initiatives , successive surveys have shown that the incidence and prevalence of breast feeding in the UK have remained static since 1980 . In 1995  62 % of women started to breast feed in Engl and and Wales , 48 % in Scotl and , and 41 % in Northern Irel and .6  ( Figures st and ardised for  mother 's age and age finished full time education  . ) Furthermore ,  breast feeding rates  in the  UK  have been found to be strongly associated with social class ; 90 % of  women  from  social  class I started to breast feed in 1995 compared with only 50 % of women from social class V.7 Policies to increase the  prevalence of breast feeding  have been recommended in a recent Department of Health action report on reducing  health inequalities7  ( arising from the White Paper Saving lives : our healthier nation 8) This bulletin is based mainly on interventions which have been evaluated using  r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs )  or  non- RCTs  . Reference is made to findings from before/after studies where there is limited or no evidence from RCTs and /or non- RCTs . Details of all the studies together with the methods used are available in the full report.2 The studies were difficult to synthesis e because they vary according to the population s studied."
"tThere is a gap in knowledge of  women 's  perceptions of   e-health  treatment  . This review aims to investigate  women 's  expectations and experiences regarding  e-health .  A search was conducted in MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL and PsycInfo in March 2016 .  We included articles published between 2000 and March 2016 , reporting on  e-health interventions .   The  initial search yielded 2987 articles . Eventually  ,  16 articles reporting on 16 studies were included .  Barriers to   e-health  treatment  were lower for women than barriers to face-to-face treatment , such as  feelings of shame and time constraints .  Women were able to develop an  online therapeutic relationship  . As reduced  feelings of obligation  and  lack of motivation  were women 's greatest challenges in completing  e-health  treatment , they expressed a wish for more support during  e-health treatment  , preferably blended care  . e-Health  lowers the threshold for women to seek healthcare . Combining  e-health interventions  with  face-to-face  sessions may enhance women 's  motivation  to complete treatment."
"gOur misconception that  renal cancer  is a single disease entity that should be managed the same surgically and medically has hampered our progress in the management of  non – clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( nccRCC )  . The majority of our advances in the management of renal cancer have been in the realm of clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) . We have made relatively few strides in the non – clear cell subtypes . Once metastatic , nccRCC is characterised by resistance to traditional systemic therapies and poor survival [ 1–3 ] . The European Association of Urology ( EAU ) Renal Cell Carcinoma Guideline Panel conducted a systematic review of the data available on the systemic treatment of advanced nccRCC [ 4 ] . The panel concluded that there was little evidence that nccRCCs are less responsive to  mammalian target of rapamycin  inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor – targeted therapy than ccRCC , and made a weak recommendation that sunitib may be marginally better than everolimus for the systemic treatment of advanced nccRCC [ 4 ] . As a follow-on from this , in this month ’s issue of European Urology , Giles et al [ 5 ] make a compelling “ call to action ” for increased collaboration and research into nccRCC . They preferentially use the term  rare kidney cancer  ( RKC ) , which they deem more inclusive than nccRCC . The authors highlight three key shortcomings of the current lines of investigation into RKCs and make recommendations for improvement . First , Giles et al [ 5 ] highlight that the current approach of considering all RKCs to be one disease is flawed . RKCs encompass over a dozen histological entities that vary widely in their  prognosis and response to treatments  [ 6 ] . The strategy of continuing to consider them one disease is likely to lead us in to the same pitfalls as considering."
" It is unclear from the evidence review ed whether any of the interventions  ( oral magnesium , oral calcium , oral vitamin B or oral vitamin C )  provide an effective treatment for  leg cramps .  This is primarily due to outcomes being measured and reported in different , incomparable ways , and design limitations compromising the quality of the evidence ( the level of evidence was grade d low or very low ) . This was mainly due to poor study design and trials being too small to address the question satisfactorily .  Adverse outcomes  were not reported , other than side effects for magnesium versus placebo/no treatment . It is therefore not possible to assess the safety of these interventions .The inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of outcomes , meant that data could not be pooled , meta-analyses could not be carried out , and comparisons between studies are difficult . The review only identified trials of  oral interventions ( magnesium , calcium , vitamin B or vitamin C )  to treat   leg  cramps in pregnancy .  None of the trials considered non-drug therapies , for example ,  muscle stretching , massage , relaxation , heat therapy  , and  dorsiflexion of the foot .  This limits the completeness and applicability of the evidence .St and ardised measures for assessing the  frequency , intensity and duration of leg cramps  to be used in large well-conducted r and omised controlled trials are needed to answer this question . Trials of non-drug therapies are also needed."
" These data confirm the limited effectiveness of currently available  palliative chemotherapy regimens  for  RMSCCHN patients .  Novel therapeutics offering improvements in  quality and quantity of life  are urgently needed for these patients . Based on these results , the study of such agents as first-line therapy in  RMSCCHN patients  is entirely justifiable."
"sBackground The majority of the global population can not afford existing asthma pharmacotherapy .  Physical training  as an airway anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma could potentially be a non-invasive , easily available , affordable , and healthy treatment modality . However , effects of  physical training  on airway inflammation in asthma are currently inconclusive . The main objective of this review is to summarize the effects of  physical training  on airway inflammation in asthmatics . Methods A peer review ed search was applied to Medline , Embase , Web of Science , Cochrane , and DARE data bases . We included  all observational epidemiological research studies and RCTs . Studies  evaluating at least one marker of  airway inflammation in asthmatics after a period of  physical training   were selected . Data extraction was performed in a blinded fashion . We decided a priori to avoid pooling of the data in anticipation of heterogeneity of the studies , specifically heterogeneity of airway inflammatory markers studied as outcome measures . Results  From the initial 2635 studies ; 23 studies ( 16 RCTs and 7 prospect i ve cohort studies ) were included .  Study sizes were generally small ( median sample size =  30  ) . There was a reduction in  C-reactive protein , malondialdehyde , nitric oxide , sputum cell counts and IgE  in  asthmatics  with  physical training .  Mixed results were observed after training for fractional excretion of  nitric  oxide and bronchial  hyperresponsiveness .  The data was not pooled owing to significant heterogeneity between studies , and a funnel plot tests for publication bias were not performed because there were less than 10 studies for almost all outcome measures .  Physical training  intervention type , duration , intensity , frequency , primary outcome measures , methods of assessing outcome measures , and study design s were heterogeneous . Conclusion Due to reporting issues , lack of information and heterogeneity there was no definite conclusion ; however , some findings suggest  physical training  may reduce airway inflammation in asthmatics."
" Further r and omized , controlled trials comparing endpoints and investigating longer-term benefits of combining  TNF inhibitors  with rehabilitation in different AS subgroups are needed."
"sBACKGROUND Prognosis for  patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas ( STS )  is dismal , with median overall survival ( OS ) of 8 - 12 months . The role of  second-line therapy  has been inconsistently investigated over the last 20 years . This systematic review and meta- analysis was performed to assess the  efficacy  of  salvage treatment  in  pretreated adult type STS , gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) excluded .  MATERIAL AND METHODS PubMed , Web of Science , SCOPUS , EMBASE , CINAHL , and The Cochrane Library were search ed for r and omized phase II/phase III trials exploring  second- or beyond therapy lines  in  pretreated metastatic STS .  Two independent investigators extracted data ; the quality of eligible studies was resolved by consensus .  Hazard ratio ( HR ) of death and progression ( OS and progression-free survival [ PFS ] )  and  odds ratio ( OR ) for response rate ( RR )  were pooled in a fixed- or r and om-effects model according to heterogeneity . Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane 's risk of bias tool , and publication bias with funnel plots . RESULTS Overall ,  10 r and omized trials were selected .  The  pooled HR for death  was 0.81 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.73 - 0.9 ) . Second-line therapy reduced  the risk of progression  by 49 % ( HR = 0.51 , 95 % CI 0.34 - 0.76 ) . This translated into an absolute benefit in  OS and PFS  by 3.3 and 1.6 months , respectively . Finally , RR with new agents or chemotherapy doublets translated from 4.3 % to 7.6 % ( OR = 1.78 , 95 % CI 1.22 - 2.50 ) .  Better  survival  is achieved in  patients treated  with   salvage therapies  ( chemotherapy  , as  single  or  multiple agents  or  targeted biological agents )  . A 3-months gain in OS and an almost double RR is observed . Second lines also attained a reduction by 50 % the risk of progression . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE There is some evidence that salvage therapies after first-line failure are able to improve outcome in metastatic soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) .  Trabectedin , gemcitabine-based therapy , and pazopanib  are currently approved drugs used after conventional upfront treatment . This meta- analysis review s the benefit of new agents used in r and omized trials in comparison with no active treatments or older agents for recurrent/progressed STS . The results show that modern drugs confer a statistically significant 3-month benefit in terms of  overall survival  , and an increase in response rate . Despite a limited improvement in outcome , currently approved second-line therapy should be offered to patients with good performance status."
"AThis systematic review with a meta- analysis aim ed to summarize the current evidence of the effectiveness of  mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) treatment  for  knee osteoarthritis ( OA )  and to examine whether rehabilitation is an effect modifier of the effect estimate of  MSC treatment .  A  literature  search yielded  659 studies , of which 35 studies met the inclusion criteria ( n = 2385 patients ; mean age : 36.0–74.5 years ) .  The meta- analysis results suggested that  MSC treatment  through intra-articular injection or  arthroscopic implantation   significantly improved knee pain  ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] : −1.45 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : −1.94 , −0.96 ) ,  self-reported physical function  ( SMD : 1.50 , 95 % CI : 1.09 , 1.92 )  , and cartilage quality  ( SMD : −1.99 ; 95 % CI : −3.51 , −0.47 ) . However ,  the  MSC  treatment  efficacy  on cartilage  volume was limited ( SMD : 0.49 ; 95 % CI : −0.19 ,  1.16 ) . Minor adverse events ( knee pain or swelling )  were reported with a wide-ranging prevalence of 2–60 % ; however ,  no severe adverse events  occurred . The evidence for these outcomes was “ very low ” to “ low ” according to the Grade s of Recommendation , Assessment , Development and Evaluation system because of the poor study design , high risk of bias , large heterogeneity , and wide 95 % CI of the effects estimate . Performing rehabilitation was significantly associated  with better SMD for self-reported physical function  ( regression coefficient : 0.881 , 95 % CI : 0.049 , 1.712 ; P = 0.039 ) . We suggest that more high quality r and omized controlled trials with consideration of the potential rehabilitation-driven clinical benefit would be needed to facilitate the foundation of  effective MSC  treatment and  regenerative rehabilitation  for patients with knee OA."
" The future l and scape of  social media  use for patient self-care is promising . However , current use is nascent . Our extensive search yielded only 7 studies , all of which included diabetes , indicating the most interest and dem and for peer-to-peer interaction on diabetes self-care . Future research is needed to establish  efficacy and safety  in recommending social media use among peers for diabetes self-care and other conditions."
"sThe  efficacy  of  biologic or conventional systemic therapies  for psoriasis has been shown in r and omized controlled trials . Effectiveness , however , has been studied in daily practice cohorts , and no aggregation of effectiveness data is available . This systematic review search ed PubMed and EMBASE and summarized the real-world evidence on effectiveness of  biologics ( adalimumab , etanercept , infliximab and ustekinumab ) and conventional systemic therapies ( acitretin , cyclosporine , fumarates and methotrexate )  for the treatment of  plaque psoriasis in adults . Thirty-two studies were included .  Few data were available on  infliximab , ustekinumab and conventional systemics .  Results show that  biologics and conventional systemics  were  effective  in real-life  treatment of psoriasis  , with large ranges in the percentage of patients reaching 75 %  improvement in psoriasis area and severity index score  compared with baseline , especially for etanercept and adalimumab treatment .  Combination therapies of biologics with conventional systemics  , and  dose adjustments of biologics  were frequently applied strategies and may explain the large range in improvements between cohorts."
"sBACKGROUND The robust evidence base for the effectiveness of  alcohol screening and brief interventions ( ASBIs )  in primary health care ( PHC ) suggests that a widespread expansion of  ASBI  in non-medical setting s could be beneficial . Social service and criminal justice setting s work frequently with  persons with alcohol use disorders ,  and  workplace setting s  can be an appropriate setting for the implementation of alcohol prevention programs , as a considerable part of their social interactions takes place in this context . METHODS Up date of two systematic review s on  ASBI  effectiveness in workplaces , social service , and criminal justice setting s. Review to identify implementation barriers and facilitators and future research needs of  ASBI  in non-medical setting s. RESULTS We found a limited number of r and omized controlled trials in non-medical setting s with an equivocal evidence of  effectiveness of ASBI  . In terms of barriers and facilitators to implementation , the heterogeneity of non-medical setting s makes it challenging to draw overarching conclusions . In the workplace , employee concerns with regard to the  consequences of self-disclosure  appear to be key . For social services , the complexity of certain client needs suggest that a stepped and carefully tailored approach is likely to be required . DISCUSSION Compared to PHC , the review ed setting s are far more heterogeneous in terms of client groups , external conditions , and the focus on substance use disorders . Thus , future research should try to systematize these differences , and consider their implication s for the  deliverability , acceptance , and potential effectiveness  of ASBI for different target groups , organizational frameworks , and professionals."
"%Gastric  cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis  has an extremely poor prognosis , which may be improved with  cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) combined with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) .  We systematic ally review ed the literature regarding the efficacy of  CRS + HIPEC  in these patients . Electronic data bases were search ed from 2000 to 2010 . Following  CRS + HIPEC  ,  overall median survival  was 7.9 months and improved to 15 months for patients with completeness of cytoreduction scores of 0/1 , however with a  30-day mortality rate  of 4.8 %."
"rA diagnosis of  childhood cancer  is a life-changing event for the entire family .  Parents  must not only deal with the cancer diagnosis but also acquire new knowledge and skills to care safely for their child at home . Best practice s for delivery of  patient/family education  after a new diagnosis of  childhood cancer  are currently unknown . The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing body of evidence to determine the current state of knowledge regarding the delivery of education to  newly diagnosed pediatric oncology patients and families . Eighty-three articles  regarding  educational  methods , content , influencing factors   , and   interventions   for  newly diagnosed pediatric patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses  were systematic ally identified , summarized , and appraised according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation criteria . Based on the evidence , 10 recommendations for practice were identified . These recommendations address  delivery methods , content , influencing factors , and educational interventions for parents and siblings .  Transferring these recommendations into practice may enhance the  quality of education  delivered by health care providers and received by  patients and families  following a new diagnosis of childhood cancer."
"sChronic heart failure ( CHF ) is a public health problem which affects > 2 % of the adult population , with high morbidity , mortality , and financial cost . Sleep apnea , prevalent in > 50 % of patients with CHF , can aggravate vital prognosis due to worsening of heart failure . It is considered that a decrease in the apnea-hypopnea  load  may improve outcomes for those patients .  Nocturnal non invasive ventilation  can be proposed to treat sleep apnea in this situation , there being few alternatives . The present review concerns the use of   nocturnal oxygen therapy  ( NOT )  in  patients suffering from both CHF and sleep apnea .  The interest of NOT in this situation lies in its ability to reduce the  central apnea-hypopnea index  and to improve  nocturnal oximetry disorders  related to sleep apnea . Impact on  cardiac contractility , patient tolerance , side effects , and costs of NOT  are also approached as well as the underlying mechanisms of NOT . In addition , the results of the SERVE-HF trial have shown an increased  death rate  in  patients with CHF and central sleep apnea  and who were treated with  adaptive servo-ventilation  versus  control  patients . This may lead to renewed interest in NOT in those patients."
"sThe role of  N-acetylcysteine ( NAC )  in the treatment of  chronic bronchitis  is unclear . Since a number of studies have been published on this topic , a systematic review of published studies seems justified . A systematic search ( Medline , Embase , Cochrane Library , bibliographies , no language restriction ) for published r and omized trials comparing oral  NAC with placebo  in  patients with chronic bronchitis  was performed . Dichotomous data on prevention of  exacerbation  ,  improvement  of  symptoms  and  adverse effects  were extracted from original reports . The  relative benefit and number-needed-to-treat  were calculated for both individual trials and combined data .  Thirty-nine trials were retrieved ; eleven ( 2,011 analysed patients ) , published 1976 - 1994  , were regarded as relevant and valid according to preset criteria . In nine studies , 351 of 723 ( 48.5 % ) patients receiving  NAC  had no  exacerbation  compared with 229 of 733 ( 31.2 % ) patients receiving  placebo  ( relative benefit 1.56 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.37 - 1.77 ) , number-needed-to-treat 5.8 ( 95 % CI 4.5 - 8.1 ) . There was no evidence of any effect of study period ( 12 - 24 weeks ) or cumulative dose of  NAC  on efficacy . In five trials , 286 of 466 ( 61.4 % ) patients receiving  NAC  reported  improvement of their symptoms  compared with 160 of 462 ( 34.6 % ) patients receiving  placebo  ( relative benefit 1.78 ( 95 % CI 1.54 - 2.05 ) ,  number-needed-to-treat  3.7 ( 95 % CI 3.0 - 4.9 ) ) . With  NAC  , 68 of 666 ( 10.2 % ) patients reported  gastrointestinal adverse effects  compared with 73 of 671 ( 10.9 % ) taking  placebo .  With  NAC  , 79 of 1,207 ( 6.5 % ) patients withdrew from the study due to  adverse effects  , compared with 87 of 1,234 ( 7.1 % ) receiving  placebo .  In conclusion , with treatment periods of approximately 12 - 24 weeks , oral  N-acetylcysteine  reduces  the risk of exacerbations  and  improves symptoms  in  patients with chronic bronchitis  compared with  placebo  , without increasing the  risk of adverse effects .  Whether this benefit is sufficient to justify the routine and long-term use of  N-acetylcysteine  in all  patients with chronic bronchitis  should be addressed in further studies and cost-effectiveness analyses."
" PCV is effective in preventing  IPD  , X-ray defined pneumonia , and clinical pneumonia among  HIV-1 negative and HIV-1 positive children under two years .  The impact was greater for VT-IPD than for all serotypes-IPD , and for X-ray defined pneumonia than for clinical pneumonia . An 11 % reduction with a 95 % CI of -1 % to 21 % and a P = 0.08 is compatible with reduction in all-cause mortality."
 There is an urgent need for a more rigorous approach to the development of “ warm-up ” routines if the potential value of  preoperative simulation  is to be understood and realised . We propose that such interventions need to be grounded in theory and empirical evidence on human motor performance.
" Significant variations in  LRR  occur across breast cancer subtypes , with lowest rates in luminal cancers and highest rates in triple-negative breast cancers . Low levels of  LRR  highlight advances in breast cancer management in the contemporary era."
"dThe ongoing development of robotics on the one h and and , on the other h and , the foreseen relative growth in number of  elderly individuals suffering from dementia  , raises the question of which contribution robotics could have to rationalize and maintain , or even improve the quality of care . The objective of this review was to assess the published effects and effectiveness of  robot interventions  aim ing at social assistance in  elderly care .  We search ed , using Medical Subject Headings terms and free words , in the CINAHL , MEDLINE , Cochrane , BIOMED , PUBMED , PsycINFO , and EMBASE data bases . Also the IEEE Digital Library was search ed . No limitations were applied for the date of publication .  Only articles written in English were taken into account  . Collected publications went through a selection process . In the first step , publications were collected from major data bases using a search query . In the second step , 3 review ers independently selected publications on their title , using predefined selection criteria . In the third step , publications were judged based on their abstract s by the same review ers , using the same selection criteria . In the fourth step , one review er made the final selection of publications based on complete content .  Finally  ,  41 publications were included in the review , describing 17 studies involving 4 robot systems .  Most studies reported  positive effects  of companion-type robots on  (socio)psychological ( eg , mood , loneliness , and social connections and communication ) and physiological ( eg , stress reduction ) parameters .  The  method ological  quality of the studies was , mostly , low . Although positive effects were reported , the scientific value of the evidence was limited . The positive results described , however , prompt further effectiveness research in this field."
"yINTRODUCTION We aim ed to assess the  efficacy and safety  of delivering  intraperitoneal chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery for peritoneal  metastases coupled with  curative treatment  of  colorectal liver metastases .  Areas covered : A comprehensive literature search using PubMed was conducted to screen for eligible records . Studies evaluating  colorectal surgery  and  intraperitoneal chemotherapy  combined with  curative treatment  of liver metastases were included . We excluded duplicate publications .  Sixty-seven full-text papers  were assessed and six papers were finally included . The  overall survival  in the included studies ranged from 6 - 49 months .  Five-year survival  ranged from 18%-28 % ,  three-year survival  ranged from 22%-42 % and  two-year survival  ranged from 34%-78 % .  Survival  was lower in  patients with liver metastases and peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC )  than those with PC alone in the majority of studies . Expert commentary : This review poses questions rather than presenting answers . The heterogeneity of  survival  data suggests the possible benefit of this aggressive treatment approach in  selected patients .  St and ardization of the technique used for  intraperitoneal chemotherapy  instillation , agent used as well as the  systemic chemotherapy  and  targeted therapy  type and duration through prospect i ve controlled trials is required to provide an evidence of a higher strength to support or prohibit this treatment strategy."
"DWe aim ed to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of  infliximab biosimilar , CT-P13  , for  patients with inflammatory bowel disease .  We search ed PubMed , Scopus , Ovid , and Web of Science for relevant clinical trials discussing  CT-P31  administration for  IBD patients either naïve to  biological therapy  or switched from  IFX therapy .   Data of the  rates of clinical response , clinical remission , and adverse events  were extracted and pooled in a r and om effect model meta- analysis using CMA version 2 .  Thirty-two studies with a total of 3464 IBD patients treated with  CT-P13  were identified .  The  pooled rates of clinical response  among Crohn ’s disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) at 8–14 weeks were 0.81 ( 95 % CI = 0.72 to 0.87 ) and 0.68 ( 95 % CI = 0.63 to 0.72 ) , respectively , and at 48–63 weeks were 0.69 ( 95 % CI = 0.48 to 0.85 ) and 0.54 ( 95 % CI = 0.45 to 0.63 ) respectively . After switching from  IFX to CT-P13  , the  pooled rates of sustained clinical response  among CD and UC at 30–32 weeks were 0.84 ( 95 % CI = 0.57 to 0.96 ) and 0.96 ( 95 % CI = 0.58 to 0.99 ) , respectively , and at 48–63 weeks were 0.51 ( 95 % CI = 0.22 to 0.79 ) and 0.83 ( 95 % CI = 0.19 to 0.99 )  respectively  .  Moreover , adverse events  were reported ( CD = 0.10 , 95 % CI 0.04 to 0.22 ; UC = 0.18 , 95 % CI 0.05 to 0.15 ) .  CT-P13  is  effective and well  tolerated in short and long-term periods . Switching  to CT-P13  is recommended for the management of IBD."
 The overall findings indicate that IVL often has negative effects on patients '  quality of life and mental health  and that such effects tend to remain over time . Specific factors and variables associated with the  adjustment  to  IVL  need to be clarified through further in-depth and longitudinal research.
"sPreterm infants are obviously born lighter and shorter , with smaller head circumferences than normal birth weight term born neonates . They also have a different  body composition .  Compromised growth is associated with adverse health outcomes . Both growth retardation and accelerated growth are suggested to cause metabolic , cardiovascular , and renal complications . Review s regarding growth and body composition in  preterm infants  often do not differentiate between birth weight and gestational age . The purpose of this systematic review is to assemble growth data , specific in  extremely low birth weight children .  Different data bases were search ed for studies regarding growth and body composition in  former extremely low birth weight infants until adulthood .  We compared height , weight , head circumference , body mass index , fat mass , lean mass , fat distribution , and body water to matched normal birth weight controls and the World  Health Organization  growth  charts  . Studies consistently reported that former extremely  low birth weight neonates  experience a period of  accelerated postnatal growth  , but they achieve lower  anthropometric parameters  than normal birth weight children . There is no consensus about differences in body composition and how to measure this . Conclusion : Although  extremely low birth weight infants  exhibit a period of catch-up  growth  , their growth remains retarded later in life . Further research is needed to investigate body composition and the associated risk of cardiovascular diseases or metabolic syndrome . What is Known : •  Extremely low birth weight infants  have lower  anthropometric parameters  and a  different body composition  at birth and term-corrected age than normal birth weight infants . • Former extremely low birth weight infants also have a higher risk on  adverse cardiovascular health outcomes  in later life . What is New : • After hospital discharge , extremely low birth weight neonates remain smaller and probably also  lighter  , with  smaller head circumferences  at each corrected age throughout childhood and adolescence when compared to normal birth weight infants or the World Health Organization growth charts . It is not clear whether extremely low birth weight infants reach a lower or similar  body mass index score  as normal birth weight infants . • There is a lack of ( long-term ) information on body composition in extremely low birth weight infants . What is Known : • Extremely  low birth  weight infants have lower  anthropometric parameters  and a  different body composition  at birth and term-corrected age than normal birth weight infants . • Former extremely low birth weight infants also have a higher risk on  adverse cardiovascular health outcomes  in later life . What is New : • After hospital discharge , extremely low birth weight neonates remain smaller and probably also lighter , with smaller  head circumferences  at each corrected age throughout childhood and adolescence when compared to normal birth weight infants or the World Health Organization growth charts .

":In the early 1970s all  colorectal cancer patients with metastases  received  intravenous 5-fl uorouracil ( 5FU ) chemotherapy  which often continued despite tumor progression . Some patients also received  chemotherapy  after radical resection as it was thought that the treatment at least could slow down the progress of the cancer . This practice was terminated at our hospital in 1976 , supported by the paper of Moertel who question ed the role of  5FU  , stating that it was a nontreatment and also emphasized its side  effects  [ 1 ] . Despite his skepticism , Moertel continued his search for combinations which could infl uence the  course  of  colorectal  cancers . In 1989 and 1990 , two seminal papers reported that  5FU  combined with the antihelmintic drug  levamisol  for one year improved  disease-free survival ( DFS ) and cancer-specifi c survival ( CSS )  [ 2,3 ] . After the National Institute of Health Consensus Statement , this regimen rapidly was accepted in USA and most countries worldwide [ 4 ] . However , in the  Sc and inavian countries  the new treatment was met with initial skepticism by the surgeons who had learned that  5FU  had limited success in colorectal cancer . To introduce the treatment , separate studies were therefore launched in Sweden ,  Norway  and  Denmark  , mostly using the original Moertel regimen [ 5,6 ] . Later  5FU combined with calciumfolinate ( leukovorin ) ( FLv )  replaced the Moertel regimen as this could be administered for six months instead of one year with similar effi cacy [ 7 ] . Based on these studies and a convincing number of other confi rmatory studies ,  adjuvant  treatment was then accepted as st and ard therapy for colon cancer in all Nordic countries as in other countries . In the current issue of Acta Oncologica , B ö ckelman et al. present an up date d review on the  prognosis for colon cancer stage II and III  [ 8 ] . The review is one in a series of papers from an Acta Oncologica initiative to promote young scientists in  the Nordic countries  , ‘ young scientist ’ s workshop ’ held during the Acta Oncologica 50 year celebration in 2013 [ 9,10 ] . During the workshop , groups of young scientist started working with systematic review s in challenging , edge cutting and clinical ly relevant topics . Another review from the workshop , dealing with the  predictive role of mutations in signaling pathways downstream of EGFR to EGFR inhibition  in metastatic  colorectal cancer  was recently published [ 11 ] . From totally 2600 published papers they report on 15 559 colon  cancer patients with stage II and 18 425 patients with stage III , of which 84 % were treated between 2000 and 2008 .  This is important information refl ecting the current status of treatment of colon cancer , in contrast to a continuous improvement in treatment of rectal cancer including more extensive surgery  termed total mesorectal excision , staging with MRI  ,  multidisciplinary team  and use of  preoperative radiochemotherapy  [ 12 – 14 ] . Recently a similar focus on careful systematic  surgery  for colon cancer with  central lymph node dissection ( D3 resection )  and  total mesocolic excision  has been accepted and is introduced in clinical practice [ 15 – 18 ] . Colon cancer surgery is becoming more limited to gastrointestinal surgeons specially trained in colorectal surgery [ 19 ] . Also the pathology assessment of the operation specimens has improved [ 20,21 ] . While diagnosis of one or two lymph node metastases was considered suffi Acta Oncologica , 2015 ; 54 :."

"yContact  with nature  has been proposed as a solution to achieve  physiological relaxation and stress recovery  , and a number of scientific verification outcomes have been shown . Compared with studies of the other senses , studies investigating the visual effects of  nature  have been at the forefront of this research field . A variety of physiological indicators adopted for use in indoor experiments have shown the benefits of viewing  nature  . In this systematic review , we examined current  peer- review ed  articles regarding the physiological effects of  visual stimulation from  elements  or representations of nature  in an  indoor setting  . The articles were analyzed for their stimulation method , physiological measures applied , groups of participants , and outcomes .  Thirty-seven articles presenting evidence of  the  physiological effects of viewing nature were selected .  The majority of the studies that used  display stimuli  , such as  photos , 3D images , virtual reality ,  and  videos of natural l  and scapes , confirmed that viewing natural scenery led to more  relaxed body responses  than viewing the control . Studies that used  real nature stimuli  reported that visual contact with flowers , green plants , and wooden material s had  positive effects on cerebral and autonomic nervous activities  compared with the control . Accumulation of scientific evidence of the  physiological relaxation  associated with  viewing elements of nature  would be useful for preventive medicine , specifically nature therapy."

"sPurpose Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder . In-laboratory ,  overnight type I polysomnography ( PSG )  is the current “ gold st and ard ” for diagnosing OSA .  Home sleep apnea testing ( HSAT )  using  portable monitors  ( PMs ) is an alternative testing method offering better comfort and lower costs . We aim ed to systematic ally review the evidence on diagnostic ability of  type IV PMs  compared to  PSG  in diagnosing OSA . Methods  Participants : patients ≥16 years old with symptoms suggestive of OSA;intervention  :  type IV PMs  ( devices with < 2 respiratory channels ) ; comparator : in-laboratory PSG ; outcomes : diagnostic accuracy measures ; studies : cross-sectional , prospect i ve observational/experimental/quasi-experimental studies ; information sources : MEDLINE and Cochrane Library from January 1 , 2010 to May 10 , 2016 . All stages of review were conducted independently by two investigators . Results We screened  6054 abstract s and 117 full-text articles to  select 24 full-text articles for final review . These 24 studies  enrolled a total of 2068 patients with suspected OSA  and evaluated 10 different PMs with one to six channels . Only seven ( 29 % ) studies tested PMs in the home setting .  The mean difference ( bias ) between  PSG-measured  and PM-measured apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI )  ranged from − 14.8 to 10.6 events/h . At AHI ≥ 5 events/h ,  the sensitivity  of type IV PMs ranged from 67.5–100 % and specificity ranged from 25 to 100 % . Conclusion While current evidence is not very strong for the st and -alone use of level IV PMs in clinical practice , they can potentially widen access to diagnosis and treatment of OSA . Policy recommendations regarding  HSAT  use should also consider the health and broader social implication s of false positive and false negative diagnoses."
" We did not find a difference in the  risk of death or serious adverse events  in either adults or children . However , trial authors reported no asthma  deaths  among  27,951 adults or 8453 children r and omised to regular  salmeterol and ICS or ICS  alone  over an average of six months . Therefore , the  risk of dying  from asthma on either treatment was very low , but we remain uncertain about whether the risk of  dying  from asthma is altered by adding salmeterol to ICS  .  Inclusion of new trials has increased the precision of the estimates for  non-fatal SAEs  of any cause . We can now say that the worst-case estimate is that at least  152 adults and 139 children  must be treated with  combination salmeterol and ICS  for six months for one additional person to be admitted to the hospital ( compared to treatment with  ICS  alone ) . These possible risks still have to be weighed against the benefits experienced by people who take combination treatment . However more than 90 % of prescribed treatment was taken in the new trials , so the effects observed may be different from those seen with salmeterol in combination with  ICS  in daily practice."

"HOBJECTIVE This study aims to systematic ally evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of  core decompression combined transplantation of autologous bone marrow stem cells ( CDBMSCs )  for treatment of  avascular necrosis of the femoral head ( ANFH ) .  METHODS R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) regarding effectiveness of  core decompression combined transplantation of autologous bone marrow stem cells  for treating ANFH were search ed in 8 comprehensive data bases prior to September 2016 . The data analysis was performed by using the RevMan version 5.3 . RESULTS A total of  11 studies with 507 participants were included .  Results showed that  CDBMSCs  group was more effective than  CD  group in  increasing Harris hip score , decreasing necrotic area of femoral head , collapse of femoral head , and conversion to total hip replacement incidence  . In the subgroup analysis , the results did not change in different intervention measure substantially . In addition ,  the  safety of  CDBMSCs  for ANFH is reliable .  Based on the systematic review , our findings suggest  that core decompression combined transplantation of autologous bone marrow stem cells  appeared to be more efficacious in the treatment at early stages of ANFH."

" Individual reports of  exercise interventions  often have low sample sizes and insufficient power to detect clinical ly meaningful hepatic benefits . By pooling current research , we show clear evidence for a benefit of  exercise therapy  on  liver fat  but not  ALT levels .

" As we did not identify any r and omised trials for inclusion in this review , we are unable to comment on implication s for practice at this stage . Although evidence from animals studies has supported a fetal neuroprotective role for  melatonin  when administered to the mother during pregnancy , no trials assessing  melatonin  for fetal neuroprotection in  pregnant women  have been completed to date . However , there is currently one ongoing r and omised controlled trial ( with an estimated enrolment target  of 60 pregnant women  ) which examines the dose of  melatonin  , administered to  women at risk of imminent very preterm birth ( less than 28 weeks ' gestation )  required to reduce  brain damage  in the white matter of the babies that were born very preterm . Further high- quality research is needed and research efforts should directed towards trials comparing  melatonin  with either no intervention  ( no treatment or placebo )  , or with alternative agents aim ed at providing  fetal neuroprotection  ( such as  magnesium sulphate  for the very preterm infant ) . Such trials should evaluate  maternal and infant short- and longer-term outcomes ( including neurosensory disabilities such as cerebral palsy )  , and consider the costs of care."

"  Adult patients with ALI receiving  RMs   experienced a significant increase in  oxygenation  , with few serious adverse events . Transient hypotension and desaturation during  RMs  is common but is self-limited without serious short-term sequelae . Given the uncertain benefit of transient oxygenation improvements in patients with ALI and the lack of information on their influence on clinical outcomes , the routine use of  RMs  can not be recommended or discouraged at this time .  RMs  should be considered for use on an individualized basis in patients with ALI who have life-threatening hypoxemia."

"sBackground About one third of deaths in  children less than 5 years of age  are due to underlying undernutrition . According to an estimate , 19.4 % of  children < 5 years of age  in developing  countries  were  underweight ( weight-for-age Z score < -2 )  and  about 29.9 % were stunted in the year 2011 ( height-for-age Z score < -2 )  . It is well recognized that the period of 6 - 24 months of age is one of the most critical time for the growth of the infant . Methods We included  r and omized , non-r and omized  trials and programs on the effect of  complementary feeding ( CF ) ( fortified or unfortified , but not micronutrients alone )  and   education  on  CF  on children less than 2 years of age in low and middle income countries ( LMIC ) .  Studies that delivered intervention for at least 6 months were included ; however , studies in which intervention was given for supplementary and therapeutic purpose s were excluded . Recommendations are made for input to the  Lives  Saved  Tool  ( LiST ) model by following st and ardized guidelines developed by Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group ( CHERG ) . Results We  included 16 studies in this review .  Amongst these , 9 studies provided  education on complementary feeding  , 6  provided complementary feeding ( with our without education )  and 1 provided both as separate arms . Overall , education on CF alone  significantly improved HAZ  ( SMD : 0.23 ; 95 % CI : 0.09 , 0.36 )  , WAZ  ( SMD 0.16 , 95 % CI : 0.05 , 0.27 ) , and  significantly reduced the rates of stunting  ( RR 0.71 ; 95 % CI : 0.56 , 0.91 ) . While no significant impact were observed for  height and weight gain .  Based on the subgroup analysis ; ten studies from food secure population s indicated education on CF had a significant  impact on height gain , HAZ scores , and weight gain  , however ,  stunting reduced non-significantly  .  In food insecure population  , CF education alone significantly  improved HAZ scores , WAZ scores  and  significantly reduced the rates of stunting  , while CF provision with or without education  improved HAZ and WAZ scores significantly  . Conclusion  Complementary feeding  interventions have a potential to improve the nutritional status of  children in developing countries .  However , large scale high quality r and omized controlled trials are required to assess the actual impact of this intervention on growth and morbidity in  children 6 - 24 months of age .  Education should be combined with provision of complementary foods that are affordable , particularly for children in food insecure countries."
" This comprehensive review demonstrates that  social media  is being used for a variety of conditions and purpose s in child health .

 The results of this meta- analysis support the use of  5-FU based postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy  for  patients undergoing apparently radical surgery for non-metastatic rectal carcinoma .  Available data do not allow us to define whether the efficacy of this treatment is highest in one specific TNM stage . The implementation of  modern anti-cancer agents  in the adjuvant setting is warranted to improve the results shown by this meta- analysis . R and omized trials of  adjuvant chemotherapy  for  patients receiving preoperative  neoadjuvant therapy   are also needed in order to define the role of  postoperative chemotherapy  in the multimodal treatment of resectable rectal cancer.
" The findings of the up date d review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that  aerobic exercise  can be regarded as beneficial for  individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy , specifically those with solid tumours .

 The current assessment tools do not capture all the critical elements of HBP self-care . The few instruments that attempted to measure the multiple behavioral dimensions of HBP self-care failed to report adequate levels of psychometric properties of those domains because of their incompleteness . Challenges remain in translating the  HBP self-care  guidelines into effective intervention and relevant assessment tools . Developing a valid and reliable instrument that captures the multidimensional nature of HBP self-care is urgently needed.
"sA systematic review of the literature regarding the effectiveness of various methods of information given to  patients with cancer receiving  chemotherapy education   revealed that  psycho-educational interventions  minimized the intensity and impact of  treatment-related fatigue  on daily life in the short term for  patients undergoing chemotherapy .  Studies that investigated efficacy of interactive multimedia devices revealed no statistical improvement in  information recall , quantity of self-care activities , and fatigue levels  between groups . Three of the multimedia studies focused on  anxiety and depression  trends before and during treatment , with mixed results . Several studies revealed no significant difference in either  anxiety or depression .  Others concluded that patients who viewed  video information in conjunction with st and ard care  were less  anxious and depressed .  Combined , these studies revealed that multimedia devices did not improve  recall of information  and that  psycho-educational interventions  were able to improve the  impact of treatment-related side effects , namely fatigue  , in the short term . This suggests that the educational needs of  patients with cancer  require a complex series of factors that impact the individual 's ability to underst and how and when to initiate recommended self-care strategies."

"2INTRODUCTION Despite recommendations that  pregnant women  increase their  docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )  intake to support fetal brain development , a recent systematic review found a lack of high- quality data to support the long-term effects of  DHA  supplementation on  children 's neurodevelopment .  METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will assess  child neurodevelopment at 7 years of age  in follow-up of a multicentre double-blind r and omised controlled trial of  DHA supplementation  in pregnancy .  In 2010 - 2012 , n=2399 Australian women with a singleton pregnancy < 21 weeks ' gestation  were r and omised to receive 3  capsules daily containing a total dose of 800 mg DHA/day or a vegetable oil placebo  until birth .  N=726 children from Adelaide ( all n=97 born preterm , r and om sample of n=630 born at term ) were selected for neurodevelopmental follow-up  and  n=638 ( preterm n=85 ) are still enrolled at 7 years of age  . At the 7-year follow-up , a psychologist will assess the primary outcome ,  IQ  ,  with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence , Second Edition .  Specific measures of  executive functioning ( Fruit Stroop and the Rey Complex Figure ) , attention ( Test of Everyday Attention for Children ) , memory and learning ( Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test ) , language ( Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals , Fourth Edition ) and basic educational skills ( Wide Range Achievement Test , Fourth Edition )  will also be administered . Caregivers will be asked to complete question naires  measuring behaviour and executive functioning .  Families , clinicians and research personnel are blinded to group assignment with the exception of families who requested unblinding prior to the follow-up . All analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principal . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION All procedures will be approved by the relevant institutional ethics committees prior to start of the study . The results of this study will be disseminated in peer- review ed journal publications and academic presentations . TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS ACTRN12605000569606 and ACTRN12614000770662."
"gWe systematic ally review ed and compared the  efficacy and safety  of once daily  ( OD ) mesalamine  to  conventional dosing  for induction and maintenance of  remission  in  ulcerative colitis ( UC ) .  A literature search to January 2012 identified all applicable r and  omized  trials . Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool . The GRADE criteria were used to assess the overall quality of the evidence . Studies were subgrouped by formulation for meta- analysis .  Eleven studies that evaluated 4070 patients were identified .  The risk of bias was low for most factors , although five studies were single-blind and one was open-label . No difference was observed between the dosing strategies in the  proportion of patients with clinical remission  ( relative risk [ RR ] 0.95 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.82 - 1.10 ) ,  clinical improvement  ( RR 0.87 95 % CI 0.68 - 1.10 ) , or  relapse  at 6 ( RR 1.10 ; 95 % CI 0.83 - 1.46 ) or 12 months ( RR 0.92 ; 95 % CI 0.83 - 1.03 ) . Subgroup analyses showed no important differences in  efficacy  . No significant difference was demonstrated in  rates of medication adherence or adverse events  between  OD  and  conventional dosing . OD mesalamine  appears to be  as effective and safe  as  conventional dosing  for both the treatment of mild to moderately active UC and for maintenance of remission in quiescent UC . The failure to demonstrate a  superior rate of adherence  to  OD  dosing may be due to the high rate of adherence observed in the clinical trials environment . Future research should assess the value of  OD  dosing in community setting."
"  Acupuncture  probably has little or no effect in reducing  pain  or improving  function  relative to sham  acupuncture  in  people with hip osteoarthritis .  Due to the small sample size in the studies , the confidence intervals include both the possibility of moderate benefits and the possibility of no effect of  acupuncture .  One unblinded trial found that  acupuncture  as an addition to routine primary physician care was associated with benefits  on pain and function .  However , these reported benefits are likely due at least partially to RCT participants ' greater expectations of benefit from  acupuncture  . Possible side effects associated with  acupuncture  treatment were minor."

"dBackground The objective was to perform a systematic review in order to describe the relationship between  asthma and sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) in children  , especially regarding the impact of treatment and management . Methods We performed an electronic search in MEDLINE , EMBASE , and LILACS data base . Study inclusion criteria were the following :  1 ) studies that examined the relationship between asthma/wheezing and SDB/obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ; and 2 ) studies conducted in children < 18 years of age .  Primary outcomes were the  prevalence of asthma and SDB  , the  tests used for diagnosis  , and the  influence of their treatment and management  . Results  One thous and and twenty studies were identified , among which 32 were selected ( n=143,343 children ; 51 % males ; age [ mean ± st and ard deviation ] 8.4±2.5 years ) .  Most studies ( n=26 ) diagnosed SDB using question naires or clinical history . Nine studies performed a sleep study for diagnosing OSA . The diagnosis of asthma was based on clinical history ( n=16 ) , previous medical diagnosis ( n=4 ) , question naires ( n=12 ) , and spirometry ( n=5 ) .  Children with asthma  were more likely to  develop habitual snoring and OSA  , and children with SDB were more likely to  develop asthma  . Moreover , asthma was associated with  more severe OSA  , and the presence of SDB was associated  with severe asthma  . Treatment of SDB  with adenotonsillectomy  was associated  with significant asthma  improvement . Conclusion The relationship between asthma and SDB appears to be bidirectional ,  and adenotonsillectomy  appears to  improve asthma  control . Future trials on how asthma treatment could impact  on SDB  are needed."
"yBACKGROUND Esophageal  cancer  remains a major public health issue worldwide . In clinical practice ,  chemo(radio)therapy  is an important approach to  patients with esophageal cancer .  Only the part of patients who respond to  chemo(radio)therapy  achieve better long-term outcome . In this case , predictive biomarkers for response of  esophageal cancer patients treated with  chemo(radio)therapy   are of importance . Meta- analysis of P53 for predicting esophageal cancer response has been reported before and is not included in our study . We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize and evaluate the biomarkers for predicting response to  chemo(radio)therapy .  METHOD PubMed , Web of Science  and the Ovid data bases  were search ed to identify  eligible studies published in English before March 2017 .  The  risk ratio ( or relative risk , RR )  was retrieved in articles regarding biomarkers for predicting  response of esophageal cancer patients treated with  neoadjuvant therapy or chemo(radio)therapy .   Fixed and r and om effects models were used to undertake the meta- analysis as appropriate . RESULT  Forty-six articles reporting 56 biomarkers correlated with the response were finally included  . Meta-analyses were carried out when there was more than one study related to the reported biomarker . Results indicated that  low expression of ( or IHC-negative ) COX2 , miR-200c , ERCC1 and TS  was individually associated with prediction  of response .  The  RR  was 1.64 ( n = 202 , 95 % CI 1.22 - 2.19 , P < 0.001 ) , 1.96 ( n = 162 , 95 % CI 1.36 - 2.83 , P < 0.001 ) , 2.55 ( n = 206 , 95 % CI 1.80 - 3.62 , P < 0.001 ) and 1.69 ( n = 144 , 95 % CI 1.10 - 2.61 , P = 0.02 ) , respectively .  High expression of ( or IHC-positive ) CDC25B and p16  was individually related to prediction  of response  . The  RR  was 0.62 ( n = 159 , 95 % CI 0.43 - 0.89 , P = 0.01 ) and 0.62 ( n = 142 , 95 % CI 0.43 - 0.91 , P = 0.01 ) , respectively .  Low expression of ( or IHC-negative ) COX2 , miR-200c , ERCC1 and TS , or high expression of ( or IHC-positive ) CDC25B and p16 are potential biomarkers for predicting the response  of esophageal cancer patients treated with  chemo(radio)therapy."

"sPURPOSE This study aim ed to systematic ally review studies that investigated the effects of  normal saline instillation before  endotracheal  suctioning  and to determine the views of  nurses  concerning this procedure . METHODS This study was carried out in 2 stages as a systematic review and a descriptive study . In the first stage , the Medline and CINAHL data bases were search ed . The second stage of the study consisted of a  survey of 65 intensive care nurses .  RESULTS The systematic review identified 7 studies . Nearly all of the studies had a self-controlled clinical trial design .  Normal saline instillation  before  endotracheal suctioning  was demonstrated to decrease  patient oxygenation  in most studies ( P < .05 ) . However , the impact of  normal saline  on  hemodynamics and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia  remain unclear . Most nurses ( 87.7 % ) apply  normal saline instillation .   Although the effects of  normal saline instillation  on  hemodynamics and pneumonia  incidence remain controversial , this procedure significantly decreases the  oxygenation .  Therefore , the use of this procedure is not recommended . However ,  normal saline instillation  is used frequently by  nurses  to manage thick and tenacious secretions in clinical practice . Additional studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of applications that may be alternatives to  normal saline instillation  in the management of these secretions."
"/Background  Oropharyngeal dysphagia  or  swallowing difficulties  are common in acute  care and critical care  , affecting 47 % of hospitalised  frail elderly  , 50 % of  acute stroke patients  and approximately 62 % of  critically ill patients who have been intubated and mechanically ventilated for prolonged periods  . Complications of dysphagia include aspiration leading to chest infection and pneumonia , malnutrition , increased length of hospital stay and re-admission to hospital . To date , most  dysphagia  interventions in acute care have been tested with  acute stroke population s.  While intervention studies in critical care have been emerging since 2015 , they are limited and so there is much to learn about the type , the delivery and the intensity of treatments in this setting to inform future clinical trials . The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the evidence regarding the relationship between dysphagia interventions and clinical ly important patient outcomes in acute and critical care setting s. Methods We will search MEDLINE , EMBASE , CENTRAL , Web of Science , CINAHL and clinical trial registries from inception to the present . We will include studies conducted with  adults in acute care setting s such as acute hospital wards or units or intensive care units and critical care setting s.  Studies will be restricted to r and omised controlled trials and quasi-r and omised controlled trials comparing a  new dysphagia intervention with usual care or another intervention .  The main outcomes that will be collected include  length of time taken to return to oral intake , change in incidence of aspiration and pneumonia , nutritional status , length of hospital stay and quality of life .  Key intervention components such as  delivery , intensity , acceptability , fidelity and adverse events  associated with such interventions will be collected to inform future clinical trials . Two independent review ers will assess articles for eligibility , data extraction and quality appraisal . A meta- analysis will be conducted as appropriate . Discussion No systematic review has attempted to summarise the evidence for oropharyngeal dysphagia interventions in acute and critical care . Results of the proposed systematic review will inform practice and the design of future clinical trials .

"yAIM To evaluate the current state-of-the-art of  gastric electrical stimulation  to treat  obesity .  METHODS Systematic review s of all studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of different types of  gastric electrical stimulation ( GES )  on  obesity .  RESULTS  Thirty-one studies consisting of a total of 33 different trials  were included in the systematic review for data analysis .  Weight loss  was achieved in most studies , especially during the first 12 mo , but only very few studies had a follow-up period longer than 1 year . Among those that had a longer follow-up period , many were from the  Transcend ( ® ) ( Implantable Gastric Stimulation )  device group and maintained  significant weight loss  . Other significant results included  changes in appetite/satiety , gastric emptying rate , blood pressure and neurohormone levels or biochemical markers such as ghrelin or HbA1c  respectively .   GES  holds great promises to be an effective obesity treatment . However , stronger evidence is required through more studies with a st and ardized way of carrying out trials and reporting outcomes , to determine the long-term effect of  GES  on obesity."
"kObstructive  sleep apnea  is a prevalent disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality , particularly due to cardiovascular disease . An emerging cardiovascular risk factor , arterial stiffness , may also be involved in the cardiovascular complications of  obstructive sleep apnea .  The purpose of this review was to summarize the current literature regarding the effect of  obstructive sleep apnea on  arterial stiffness .   We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed , Embase and the Cochrane Library . We identified  24 studies that met search criteria investigating the effect of obstructive sleep apnea on arterial  stiffness .  Arterial stiffness  was found to be increased in  obstructive sleep apnea patients  compared with controls or increased in severe compared with mild sleep apnea . In some studies , a positive correlation was identified between the  degree of arterial stiffness and sleep apnea severity .  In the two r and omized , controlled trials and the two nonr and omized trials identified , treatment of   obstructive sleep  apnea  with  continuous positive airway pressure  led to significant decreases in  arterial stiffness .  Obstructive sleep apnea appears to have an independent effect on  arterial stiffness  , which may be one of the mechanisms accounting for sleep apnea-associated cardiovascular risk."

"eQUESTIONS Does  chemotherapy-that  is ,  gemcitabine , gemcitabine plus docetaxel , doxorubicin , or trabectedin-improve  clinical  outcomes  in  women with inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent , or metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma ( lms )  ? Is there a difference in the tumour response rate to chemotherapy between  recurrent pelvic disease and extrapelvic metastases in the target patients  ? METHODS This guideline was developed by Cancer Care  Ontario 's Program  in Evidence  -Based Care  , the  Sarcoma Disease Site Group ( dsg ) , and the Gynecologic Cancer dsg .  The core methodology was the systematic review . The medline and embase data bases ( 2004 to June 2011 ) , the Cochrane Library , main guideline Web sites , and relevant annual meeting abstract s ( 2005 - 2010 ) were search ed . Internal and external review s were conducted , with final approval by the dsgs and the Program in Evidence -Based Care . CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Based on currently available evidence from the medical literature ( four single-arm phase ii studies , one arm of a r and omized controlled trial , and one abstract ) ,  doxorubicin alone , gemcitabine alone  ,  or gemcitabine plus docetaxel  may be treatment options in first- or second-line therapy ( or both ) for  women with inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent , or metastatic uterine lms .   Hematologic toxicity  is common and should be monitored , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor should be considered when gemcitabine plus docetaxel is used . Other  toxicities  ,  such as neurotoxicity , pulmonary toxicity , and cardiovascular toxicity  should be monitored . No recommendation is made for or against the use of  trabectedin  in the targeted patients . No data were available concerning differences in response in recurrent  pelvic  disease or extrapelvic metastases , or concerning quality of life."

"sThe aims of the present study were to review the validity of  dietary methods  used to measure the usual  long chain ( LC ) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 PUFA )  intake of a population and to assess the usefulness of different biomarkers of n-3 PUFA in  healthy humans .  Two systematic literature search es were conducted until May 2011 to up date previous systematic review s. The first literature search aim ed to find studies validating the methodology used for measuring the  dietary intake of n-3 PUFA .  The second search aim ed to find human intervention studies in which n-3 PUFA status changed after 2 weeks of  n-3 PUFA supplementation .   Sixteen studies were identified for inclusion in the first review .   Correlation coefficients between fatty acids in subcutaneous fat or blood lipids  and dietary intake  of n-3 PUFA  from different question naires were similar . Subcutaneous fat has been reported as the best reference method for some authors , and these studies showed moderate correlation coefficients with no dietary intake method being superior to any other . As for the evaluation of biomarkers  of docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA  ,  22  : 6 n-3 ) and  eicosapentaenoic acid  ( EPA ,  20  : 5n-3 ) status in response to supplementation , the new search reaffirmed and reinforced the evidence supporting that  plasma phospholipid DHA , erythrocyte DHA , and platelet DHA  were all effective and robust  biomarkers of  DHA status . Our findings only confirmed earlier studies and did not provide evidence for reaching new conclusions."

 The present findings are in line with the pharmacological recommendations for stepwise management of asthma given in the most recent evidence -based clinical practice guidelines for the disease . The identified reporting quality of the available health economic evidence is useful for identifying aspects where there is room for improvement in future asthma cost-effectiveness studies.
"sBACKGROUND Osteonecrosis  of the femoral head ( ONFH )  is associated with regional loss of cells within bone , often result ing in pain and mechanical collapse . Our purpose was to analyze the  cell-therapies  used in clinical trials for the treatment of ONFH with regard to ( 1 ) cell- sources , ( 2 ) collection techniques , ( 3 )  cell-processing  , ( 4 ) qualitative and quantitative characterizations , and ( 5 ) delivery methods . METHODS A systematic review of the current literature on the use of  cell therapies  for the treatment of ONFH was performed . Studies with a level-of- evidence III or higher were evaluated .  A total of 1483 articles were screened .  Eleven  studies  met the criteria to be included in this review . RESULTS Ten studies used  bone-marrow  , and 1 study used  blood  as the cell- source . Nine studies used freshly isolated  tissue-derived nucleated cells  from bone-marrow , mixed bone marrow-derived nucleated cells , 1 study used  mixed blood-derived nucleated cells  , and 1 study used  culture-exp and ed cells  derived from  bone marrow  aspirate . Cell dose varied from 2-million to 3-billion cells . Qualitative cell characterization of injected cells using surface markers was done by 5 studies using CD34 . Two studies assayed the  cell- population  using a colony-forming-unit assay .  There is a lack of st and ardization with respect to the quantitative and qualitative characterization of methods for cell-harvest , cell-processing , and cell-transplantation/delivery .  Cell-therapy  holds promise as a means of restoring local cell population s that are made deficient because of injury or disease . However , the orthopedic community and patients will benefit greatly by a greater investment in blinded , r and omized , controlled trials and clinical effectiveness trials that embrace rigorous st and ards."

"eA  7-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine ( PCV7 )  was licensed in the United States of America in 2000 , but no comprehensive postmarketing review of safety has been carried out . We conducted a systematic review of the safety of  PCV7  and  other pneumococcal conjugate vaccines .  A total of  42 studies were included in the review .  Reactogenicity data from some r and omized trials suggest that  PCV7  may result in more  local reactions  and  fever  than certain comparison vaccines . However , the reactions were mild and self-limited , and  PCV7  did not carry an increased risk of  severe injection-site reactions  or  high fever .  Some , although not all , of the r and omized trials in  children  found that  mild local and systemic reactions  associated with  PCV7  may increase with the number of doses , at least over the three-dose primary series . In addition ,  PCV7  and other  pneumococcal conjugate vaccines  were found to have  tolerable reactogenicity  in Native American and African population s and in medically high-risk groups for which pneumococcal vaccination is recommended . Two of the largest studies of  PCVs  , one involving  PCV7  and the other ,  PCV9  , found a statistically significant increased  risk of hospitalization for reactive airway disease , including asthma .  Another large trial of  PCV9  , however , did not find an  increased risk of asthma .  In conclusion , this review of the evidence did not identify any major  safety problems  with  PCV7  or any other pneumococcal conjugate  vaccine  , with the possible exception of  reactive airway disease  , which may bear further scrutiny as additional data become available."

"kThis systematic review synthesized and analyzed clinical findings related to the effectiveness of  innovative technological feedback  for tackling  functional  gait recovery .   An electronic search of PUBMED , PEDro , WOS , CINAHL , and DIALNET was conducted from January 2011 to December 2016 . The main inclusion criteria were :  patients with modified or abnormal gait ; application of  technology-based feedback   to deal with  functional recovery of gait ;  any comparison between different kinds of feedback applied by means of technology , or any comparison between  technological and non-technological feedback  ; and  r  and  omized controlled  trials  . Twenty papers were included . The population s were neurological patients ( 75 % ) , orthopedic and healthy subjects . All participants were adults , bar one .  Four studies used  exoskeletons ,  6  load platforms  and 5  pressure sensors .  The breakdown of the type of feedback used was as follows : 60 % visual , 40 % acoustic and 15 % haptic . 55 % used  terminal feedback  versus 65 %  simultaneous feedback . Prescriptive feedback  was used in 60 % of cases , while 50 % used  descriptive feedback  . 62.5 % and 58.33 % of the trials showed a significant  effect  in  improving step length and speed  ,  respectively  .  Efficacy in improving other gait parameters such as balance or range of movement  is observed in more than 75 % of the studies with significant outcomes .  Treatments based on  feedback using innovative technology  in patients with abnormal gait are mostly effective in  improving gait parameters  and therefore useful for the functional recovery of patients . The most frequently highlighted types of feedback were immediate  visual  feedback followed by terminal and immediate acoustic feedback."

"yObjective The role of  additional chemotherapy  in the treatment of  high-risk prostate cancer ( PCa )  remains a controversy . This meta- analysis aim ed to investigate the effect of  additional chemotherapy  on high-risk PCa . Methods R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) about  additional chemotherapy  for  high-risk PCa  were search ed in PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . We extracted HRs  of overall survival ( OS ) and  progression-free survival  ( PFS )  for each trial and performed the meta- analysis using Review Manager 5.3 . Results  Eight RCTs involving 4,007 patients were included .  Data from four trials , which could collect OS , showed that  additional chemotherapy  could not significantly improve the OS in patients  with high-risk PCa  ( HR : 0.93 ; 95 % CI : 0.79 - 1.09 ; P=0.37 ) . However , the pooled analysis suggested significantly  longer PFS  in high-risk PCa patients treated with  additional chemotherapy  ( HR : 0.81 ; 95 % CI : 0.74 - 0.90 ; P<0.0001 ) . The meta- analysis showed  additional chemotherapy to and rogen-deprivation  therapy  improved PFS  ( HR : 0.82 ; 95 % CI : 0.74 - 0.91 ; P=0.0002 ) . Greater  improvement in PFS  was found in high-risk PCa patients treated with  additional docetaxel-based chemotherapy  ( HR : 0.73 ; 95 % CI : 0.64 - 0.83 ; P<0.00001 ) . No  prolonged PFS  was observed in high-risk PCa patients with  non-docetaxel-based chemotherapy  ( HR : 0.97 ; 95 % CI : 0.83 - 1.14 ; P=0.74 ) . Conclusion  Additional chemotherapy  ,  especially docetaxel-based chemotherapy  , could significantly improve  the PFS  in high-risk PCa patients . More evidence about the effect of  additional chemotherapy  on OS is needed . Further investigations in PCa should also focus on the suitable population for chemotherapy as well as optimal use of chemotherapy."
"dABSTRACT Background .  Motor imagery ( MI )  consists of the mental simulation of repetitive movements with the intention of promoting the learning of a motor skill . It seems to be an additional useful tool for  motor-based therapy  to potentiate the rehabilitation of the upper limb function of  post-stroke individuals .  Objective . To investigate whether  MI combined with motor-based therapy  is effective in recovering motor deficits of upper limbs from  post-stroke individuals .  Method . A systematic review of the literature was performed in the PEDro , LILACS , Cochrane , SCOPUS , Medline / PubMed and SciELO data bases . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating the efficacy of  MI associated with motor-based therapy  compared with  isolated motor-based therapy  were included . The included outcomes were  gross motor function and functional activities of the upper limb of post-stroke individuals .  The  physiotherapy evidence data base scale  was applied for evaluation of method ological quality . Results .  Four RCTs  were included  , with a total of 104 participants  , with method ological quality varying from moderate to high . There was a statistically significant  improvement  in  upper limb motor function  in all studies .  Gross motor function  was higher in  MI associated with motor-based therapy  compared to controls , but only in one study there was superiority in the results of functional activities of the upper limb . Conclusion . There is evidence showing that  MI associated with motor-based therapy  is an effective tool in improving the  motor function  of upper limbs of  post-stroke individuals .  However , more studies are needed to establish criteria for frequency and duration of intervention , and what better type of  MI  should be used."
"nThe role of  macrolides  for treatment of  children with acute asthma or wheezing exacerbations  is unclear . The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the  effectiveness  of  macrolides  in  children with recurrent wheezing presenting with acute asthma or wheezing exacerbation .  We conducted an electronic search in MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , LILACS , CENTRAL , and Clinical Trials.gov . R and omized controlled trials of  macrolides ( any macrolide )  compared with  placebo or st and ard treatment  in  children up to 18 years with recurrent wheezing/asthma presenting with an acute exacerbation .  Primary outcomes were  need for hospitalization and /or time of acute asthma/wheezing symptoms resolution ;  secondary outcomes  were duration of stay in the emergency department (ED)/clinic , severity of symptoms of the index episode , use of additional systemic corticosteroids or short active β-2 agonists , changes in lung function measures , ED visit/hospitalization during first week after index episode , time to next exacerbation , or adverse effects ( AEs )  .  Only three studies met the inclusion criteria ( n = 334 children , 410 treated episodes ) ; two studies included recurrent wheezers and the third included asthmatic children .  There was no difference  in hospitalization  between groups , but children treated with macrolides had a significantly  lower time to symptoms resolution  than controls , although the magnitude of benefit remains to be quantified due to no normal distribution data presented . There was no  difference in time to next episode of exacerbation  ( HR 0.96 ; 95 % CI 0.71–1.28 ; I2 = 0 % ; p = 0.77 ) . In one study ,  children receiving  macrolides   had a significant  decrease in the severity of symptoms  , decrease use of salbutamol , and another  study showed improved lung function  . No study  evaluated antibiotic  resistance development . Limited evidence support that a  macrolide  trial could be considered in children with acute asthma or recurrent wheezing exacerbation."
"nBackground The recommendations for the treatment of  moderate persistent asthma  in the Global Initiative for Asthma ( GINA ) guidelines for paediatric asthma are mainly based on scientific evidence extrapolated from studies in adults or on consensus . Furthermore , clinical decision-making would benefit from formal ranking of treatments in terms of effectiveness . Our objective is to assess all r and omized trial-based evidence specifically pertaining to  5 - 18 year olds with moderate persistent asthma .  Rank the different drug  treatments  of GINA guideline steps 3&4 in terms of effectiveness . Methods Systematic  review  with  network meta- analysis  . After a comprehensive search in Central , Medline , Embase , CINAHL and the WHO search portal two review ers  selected RCTs performed in 4,129 children from 5 - 18 year old , with moderate persistent asthma comparing any GINA step 3&4 medication options .  Further quality was assessed according the Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool and data -extracted included papers and built a network of the trials . Attempt at ranking treatments with formal statistical methods employing direct and indirect ( e.g. through placebo ) connections between all treatments . Results  8,175 references were screened ; 23 r and omized trials ( RCT ) , comparing head-to-head ( n=17 ) or against  placebo  ( n=10 ) , met the inclusion criteria .  Except for  theophylline  as add-on therapy in step 4 , a closed network allowed all comparisons to be made , either directly or indirectly . Huge variation in , and incomplete reporting of , outcome measurements across RCTs precluded assessment of relative efficacies . Conclusion Evidence -based ranking  of effectiveness  of drug treatments in GINA steps 3&4 is not possible yet . Existing initiatives for harmonization of outcome measurements in asthma trials need urgent implementation."

" Information-dissemination is now an acceptable use of social media by  young adults  . Using  social  media effectively for social support , either via private groups or public pages , requires careful evaluation as its effectiveness is yet to be demonstrated in experimental design s. Concerns about public social media use may be a contributing factor to poor engagement with social media in research intervention studies aim ed at influencing weight . Future research should consider how to best engage with  young adults using social media  , how to more effectively use social media to support  young adults  and to facilitate social and peer-to-peer support in making healthier choices."
"dObstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) has many serious consequences , and one of these may be the exacerbation of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Reports on the effect of  continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP )  on  glucose metabolism  in  people with T2DM and OSA  are conflicting . Therefore , the purpose of this review was to examine the effect of  CPAP  treatment on  glucose metabolism  by synthesizing findings from r and omized controlled trials . The PRISMA review protocol was developed and registered in PROSPERO . A systematic search of PubMed , CINAHL , Embase , Web of Science , PsycInfo , and Cochrane was conducted from inception to March 2017 . The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the study quality . Review Manager ( v5.2 ) was used for the meta-analyses , and the st and ardized mean difference was calculated .  Six studies consisting of 496 participants were included in this review .  The meta-analyses indicated  that  CPAP treatment did not have significant  impact on glucose metabolism measured by A1C  ( mean difference = 0.05 , 95 % CI − 0.14 to 0.24 ,  P  =  0.61 ) , fasting insulin level  ( mean difference = − 2.34 , 95 % CI − 8.19 to 3.51 , P =  0.43  )  , and fasting glucose  ( mean difference = − 0.05 , 95 % CI − 0.52 to 0.42 , P = 0.84 ) . As  expected , CPAP  treatment can  improve daytime sleepiness  ( mean difference = − 2.68 , 95 % CI − 3.91 to − 1.54 , P < 0.001 ) . Findings of this meta- analysis do not substantiate a  positive  effect of CPAP  on glucose metabolism  in  people with T2DM and coexisting OSA .  Future large-scale clinical trials with a longer treatment duration and better CPAP compliance are warranted."
"yCrohn  's disease  is associated with substantially impaired  health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) .  Even in the absence of active disease ,  patients with Crohn 's disease  report lower  HRQoL , poorer function , and greater concerns  , than those without disease . Achievement of disease remission in Crohn 's disease , whether by pharmacological or surgical means , is associated with improved  HRQoL  , although the durability of the improvement seen after intestinal resection is uncertain because of the high rate of  postoperative disease recurrence .  This review focuses on the available literature on  HRQoL  in  patients with Crohn 's disease  with an emphasis on the effects of intestinal resection and immunomodulatory therapy."
" Very low- quality evidence from five trials suggests a possible reduction in  GDM  risk for  women  receiving dietary advice versus st and ard care   , and low- quality evidence from four trials suggests no clear difference for  women  receiving low- versus moderate- to high-GI dietary advice . A possible reduction  in pregnancy-induced hypertension  for women receiving dietary advice was observed and no clear differences were seen for other reported primary outcomes . There were few outcome data for secondary outcomes .For outcomes assessed using GRADE , evidence was considered to be low to very low quality , with downgrading based on study limitations ( risk of bias ) , imprecision , and inconsistency . More high- quality evidence is needed to determine the effects  of  dietary advice interventions in pregnancy . Future trials should be design ed to monitor adherence , women 's views and preferences , and powered to evaluate effects on short- and long-term outcomes ; there is a need for such trials to collect and report on core outcomes for GDM research . We have identified five ongoing studies and four are awaiting classification . We will consider these in the next review up date."
"rPostpartum  weight retention  can predict future weight gain and long-term obesity . Moreover , failure to lose weight gained during pregnancy can lead to increased body mass index for subsequent pregnancies , increasing the risk of adverse maternal and foetal pregnancy outcomes . This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of  lifestyle interventions  aim ed at reducing  postpartum weight retention .   Seven electronic data bases  were search ed for  intervention studies and trials enrolling women with singleton pregnancies and published in English from January 1990 to October 2012 .  Studies were included when  postpartum weight  was a main outcome and when  diet and /or exercise and /or weight monitoring  were intervention components . No limitations were placed on age , body mass index or parity .  Eleven studies were identified as eligible for inclusion in this review , of which 10 were r and omized controlled trials .  Seven studies were successful in decreasing  postpartum weight retention  , six of which included both  dietary and physical activity components  , incorporated via a range of methods and delivered by a variety of health practitioners . Few studies utilized modern technologies as alternatives to traditional face-to-face support and  cost-effectiveness  was not assessed in any of the studies . These results suggest that  postpartum weight loss  is achievable , which may form an important component of  obesity  prevention in mothers  ;  however , the optimal setting , delivery , intervention length and recruitment approach remains unclear."

Each health care setting should have a transparent policy about nutritional screening , which may vary according to the ' care gap ' , available re sources , and specific population s of patients , in which the prevalence of malnutrition may vary widely."
" Because of very low- quality evidence , there is uncertainty in the effectiveness of any pharmacological intervention versus no intervention in people with alcoholic hepatitis or severe alcoholic hepatitis . Based on low- quality evidence ,  propylthiouracil  may decrease  mortality  in people with other alcohol-related liver diseases . However , these results must be confirmed by adequately powered trials with low risk of bias before  propylthiouracil  can be considered effective . Future r and omised clinical trials should be conducted with approximately  200 participants in each group  and follow-up of one to two years in order to compare the benefits and harms of different treatments in  people with alcoholic hepatitis .  R and omised clinical trials should include health-related quality of life and report serious adverse events separately from adverse events . Future  r  and  omised  clinical trials should have a low risk of bias and low risk of r and om errors."
"  Combination chemotherapy  has recently overtaken the long-st and ing  gemcitabine  as the st and ard of care . FOLFIRINOX  and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel  are highly efficacious , but our analysis shows that other combination regimens also offer a benefit . Selection of the most appropriate chemotherapy for individual patients still remains difficult , with clinicopathological stratification remaining elusive . Biomarker development is essential to help rationalise treatment selection for patients."
"sThis systematic review considers the evidence available for a relationship between  periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis .  MEDLINE  /  PubMed ,  CINAHL  ,  DOSS  , Embase , Scopus ,  Web  of Knowledge , MedNar , and  ProQuest Theses  and  Dissertations  were search ed from the inception of the data base until June 2012 for any quantitative studies that examined the association between  periodontal disease and rheumatoid  arthritis .  Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria .  Good evidence was found to support an association between these conditions with  regard to tooth loss , clinical attachment levels , and erythrocyte sedimentation rates  . Moderate evidence was noted  for C-reactive protein and interleukin-1β  . Some evidence for a  positive outcome of periodontal treatment  on the clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis was noted . These results provide moderate evidence based on biochemical markers and stronger evidence with regard to clinical parameters that common risk factors or common pathologic processes may be responsible for an association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal  disease  . Further studies are required to fully explore both the biochemical processes and clinical relationships between these 2 chronic inflammatory conditions . There is a need to move from case-control studies to more rigorous studies using well-defined population s and well-defined biochemical and clinical outcomes as the primary outcome measures with consideration of potential confounding factors."
" On the basis of the 2 studies review ed ,  PA  appears to be  safe and feasible .   PA  also shows promise to mitigate reductions in  bone mass  and might be a viable strategy to improve  fatigue , grip strength , and QOL .

"nThe current evidence regarding the safety and immunogenicity of  human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccinations  for  people living with HIV ( PLWH )  is unclear . We search ed PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library and Web of Science data bases from inception to 23 November 2018 . The  pooled proportion , relative risk ( RR )  and the  st  and  ardized mean difference ( SMD )  with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated .  Twenty-four studies consisting of 7507 participants were identified .   The pooled proportion of adverse events in HIV-infected vaccinees  was 60 % and the  antibody seroconversion rates  in HPV-6 , -11 , -16 , -18 subtypes were all above 90 % . When compared with the placebo groups ,  the risk of adverse events  was not different except for  the injection site reactions  ( RR : 2.63 , 95 % CI : 1.72–4.01 , p < 0.001 ) , and  the level of CD4  was relatively lower ( SMD : −0.17 , 95 % CI : −0.29 to −0.04 , p = 0.01 ) in the HIV-positive vaccinees groups . When compared with HIV-negative vaccinees , the  risk of adverse events  was not different , but the  pooled RR and SMD  indicated  that antibody seroconversion and geometric mean titer for HPV-18  in HIV-positive groups was lower ( RR : 0.91 , 95 % CI : 0.87–0.95 , p < 0.001 ; SMD : −0.43 , 95 % CI : −0.62 to −0.24 , p < 0.001 ) . The study proves that HPV vaccine  is safe and efficacious  for  PLWH  and has important implication s for international guidelines and strategies for HPV vaccination."
" There is moderate quality evidence  that chemotherapy   increases survival time  after primary surgery by approximately 25 % relative  to radiotherapy  in stage III and IV endometrial cancer . There is limited evidence that it is associated with more adverse effects . There is some uncertainty as to whether triplet regimens offer similar  survival  benefits over doublet regimens in the long-term . Further research is needed to determine which chemotherapy regimen(s ) are the  most effective and least toxic  , and whether the addition  of radiotherapy  further improves outcomes . A large trial evaluating the benefits and risks  of adjuvant chemoradiation versus chemotherapy  in advanced endometrial cancer is ongoing."
"gBackground : Although  chemotherapeutic regimens  containing a  taxane or platinum agent  have been widely recommended for unfavourable  carcinoma of unknown primary ( CUP )  , no evidence exists for the superiority of any administered regimens . To date , the  efficacy  has been mostly assessed in the limited setting of phase II trials , and few attempts have been made to synthesis e all available data for survival outcomes . Methods :  Electronic data  bases  were  search ed  from 1980 to 2011 .   Survival  results were combined for each pre-specified category of regimens using a r and om-effects model , and meta-regression models were used to adjust for heterogeneity in some known prognostic factors . Results :  A total of 32 studies were included for meta- analysis .  Tendency towards better  survival outcome  by platinums or taxanes was indicated . After adjustment for important prognostic factors , however , the difference between the  platinum-based  and  non-platinum  regimens became no longer significant .  Survival benefits  by the taxane-based regimens remained significant , with a  prolonged median survival time  of 1.52 months ( P=0.03 ) and a  higher 1-year survival rate  of 6.25 % ( P=0.05 ) , but the benefit did not sustain for 2 years . Conclusion : Although no effective therapies have been established , this meta- analysis helps to fill an important gap of evidence . However , caution should still be taken because of the potential unmeasured confounding."

"sBackground :  Esophageal cancer  is one of the worst malignant digestive neoplasms with poor treatment outcomes .  Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CRT )  has become the st and ard nonsurgical treatment option for locally  advanced esophageal cancer .  The  chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin  have been most commonly used in CRT of esophageal cancer . However ,  radiotherapy combined with 5-FU/cisplatin  often delivers severe  toxicity  to patients . S-1 as an oral chemotherapeutic drug exhibits higher anti-tumor activity , less adverse effects , and better biological availability . S-1 also has excellent effects as a CRT regimen for esophageal cancer . Methods : A systematic literature search will be performed through January 2018 using MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and Google Scholar for relevant articles published in any language . R and omized controlled trials , prospect i ve comparative studies will be included . All meta-analyses will be performed using Review Manager software . The quality of the studies will be evaluated using the guidelines listed in the Cochrane H and book . The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses statements will be followed until the findings of the systematic review and meta- analysis are reported . Results : The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis will be published in a peer- review ed journal .

"sAdolescence is a critical stage in the life cycle , and adequate nutrition is necessary for the proper growth and development of individuals and their offspring . Here , we comprehensively review all published systematic review s ( through October  2016 )  on  adolescents ( 10 - 19 years ) and women of reproductive age , including pregnant women  , which targeted interventions related to nutrition . For interventions where there was no existing systematic review on adolescents , we review ed primary studies /trials . We included interventions on  micronutrient supplementation ( iron , folic acid , iron-folic acid ( IFA ) , calcium , vitamin D , vitamin A , zinc , iodine , and multiple micronutrients ) , food/protein energy supplementation , nutrition education for pregnant adolescents , obesity prevention and management  , and management  of  gestational  diabetes .  We identified a total of 35 systematic review s , of which  only five were conducted on adolescents , and 107 primary studies on adolescents .  Our review suggests that  iron alone , IFA , zinc , and multiple micronutrient supplementation  in adolescents can significantly improve  serum hemoglobin concentration .  While zinc supplementation in pregnant adolescents showed improvements in  preterm birth and low birth weight  , we found a paucity of trials on  calcium , vitamin D , vitamin A  , and iodine supplementation  .  We found limited evidence on food/protein energy supplementation in adolescents . Interventions to prevent and manage  obesity  showed a nonsignificant impact on  reducing body mass index .  This review underscores the importance of adolescent nutrition interventions . It is imperative that countries design nutritional interventions , particularly for adolescents."

"tOBJECTIVE To compare the  efficacy  of  adalimumab and infliximab  for the treatment of  moderate to severe ulcerative colitis  using indirect treatment comparison meta- analysis . METHODS A systematic review and Bayesian indirect treatment comparison meta-analyses were performed for  seven patient-important clinical outcomes at 8 weeks and  52 weeks .  Odds ratio ( OR )  estimates and associated 95 %  credible intervals  ( CrIs ) were produced . RESULTS  Five eligible RCTs  informed  clinical remission , response , mucosal healing , quality of life , colectomy , serious adverse events , and discontinuation due to adverse events  at 8 weeks and 52 weeks . At 8 weeks of induction therapy ,  clinical remission  ( OR=0.42 , 95 % CrI 0.17 - 0.97 ) ,  clinical response  ( OR=0.45 , 95 % CrI 0.23 - 0.89 ) and  mucosal healing  ( OR=0.46 , 95 % CrI 0.25 - 0.86 ) statistically favored  infliximab  . However , after 52 weeks of maintenance therapy OR estimates showed no significant difference between  infliximab  and  adalimumab  . For  serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events  ,  adalimumab  and  infliximab  were similar to  placebo  . Further , the indirect treatment comparison of adalimumab and  infliximab  yielded  odds ratios  close to 1.00 with wide credible intervals .  The findings of this indirect treatment comparison meta- analysis suggest that both  infliximab  and  adalimumab  are superior to placebo in the treatment of  moderate to moderately severe ulcerative colitis .  While  infliximab  is statistically more effective than adalimumab in the  induction of remission , response and mucosal healing  at 8 weeks ,  infliximab  and  adalimumab  are comparable in efficacy at 52 weeks of maintenance treatment."
 HPV vaccination   in males  is  moderately effective against persistent anogenital HPV infection and high- grade anal intraepithelial lesions  in studies where the population consists mainly of HPV-infected  males . Vaccine effectiveness  was high in study groups comprising  HPV-naïve males  . This supports a recommendation for vaccination of  boys  before the onset of sexual activity with the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection . Mathematical modelling studies will still be needed to assess the effects of adding males to existing HPV vaccination programs in females .

"sBecause of the age-related immune system decline , 2 potentiated influenza vaccines were specifically licensed for  the elderly  :  Fluad ( ® ) , an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine administered intramuscularly ( IM-MF59 )  , and  Intanza 15 mcg ( ® ) , a non adjuvanted vaccine administered intradermally ( ID )  . The objective of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of studies that evaluated  antibody responses  in  the elderly  following immunization with  IM-MF59 or ID vaccines  . The two potentiated vaccines induced  immune responses  satisfying , in most instances , the European Medicine Agency immunogenicity criteria , both against vaccine antigens and heterovariant drifted strains . Considering pooled data reported in the articles analyzed and papers directly comparing the 2 vaccines , the  antibody responses  elicited by  IM-MF59  and ID were found to be generally comparable . The use of  IM-MF59  and ID vaccines can be proposed as an appropriate strategy for  elderly seasonal influenza vaccination  although further studies are required for a more complete characterization of the 2 vaccines."

"sFor  women of reproductive age , excessive gestational weight gain  and /or  postpartum weight retention  can increase the risk of obesity . This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of  lifestyle modification control  trials that utilize  exercise interventions , with or without dietary intervention  , on weight loss among  postpartum women .  A search of r and omized clinical trials ( RCT ) was performed using the follow data bases and the bibliography of c and i date studies : MEDLINE , Web of Science , EMBASE , CENTRAL /Cochrane and Physiotherapy Evidence Data base .  English language RCT papers published up to 31 October 2012  , which present changes on   maternal body weight   from baseline to the end of   exercise intervention   were included . The primary meta- analysis examined the effects of  exercise interventions , with or without complementary dietary intervention  , on  weight loss  during  the postpartum period  compared with usual st and ard of care . Five subgroup analyses were performed to examine differences in study interventions and exercise modalities : duration of  intervention  ,  quality  of  study methodology  ,  supervision of exercise intervention  ,  exercise  intervention goals used and the type of dietary  intervention  . In total  11 studies met eligibility criteria with 769 participants , 409 under intervention and 360 in the control group .  The primary meta- analysis included all 11 studies and found a  mean difference ( MD ) on weight loss  of −2.57 kg ( 95 % CI −3.66 to −1.47 ) . The subgroup analysis demonstrated that the most effective interventions in  reducing weight in postpartum women  were  exercise programs  with objective ly defined goals , such as the use of  heart rate monitors  or  pedometer  ( MD of −4.09 kg—95 % CI −4.94 to −3.25 , I2=0 % ) and  exercise combined with intensive dietary intervention  ( MD of −4.34 kg—95 % CI −5.15 to −3.52 , I2=0 % ) . Thus , there is benefit from overall  lifestyle interventions   on weight loss  in  postpartum  women and  exercise plus  intensive diet and objective targets are the most effective intervention strategies."
"sContext Physicians sometimes recommend  nutritional supplementation  for  sick , older persons .  Contribution This review summarizes 55 trials of  protein and energy supplementation  in  people older than 65 years of age .  Compared with  placebo or no supplementation , nutritional supplements  did not affect  morbidity or mortality  in  people living in the community .  Among  older and undernourished hospitalized patients  , supplements sometimes reduced  mortality and complications ,  such as  infections , poor wound healing , and pressure sores .   Oral supplements  also sometimes caused  nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea .  Caution s Many trials were small or had short follow-up times and used outcome assessors who knew which patients took supplements . The Editors Undernutrition among older  people  is a continuing source of concern ( 1 , 2 ) .  Older people  have longer periods of illness and longer hospital stays ( 3 ) , and data show that up to 55 % of  elderly hospitalized patients are undernourished at admission  ( 4 , 5 ) . Malnutrition is associated with poorer recovery in a broad range of patients and conditions ( 6 - 8 ) . However , poor nutritional status may be a marker for severity of existing medical conditions , and whether improving nutritional status with  oral protein and energy supplementation  can improve acute or chronic medical conditions is not clear . Recent systematic review s examining the potential benefits of  nutritional supplementation  in older people include Stratton and colleagues ' review ( 9 ) of r and omized and nonr and omized  trials ( 166 trials ; 7630 patients )  across all disease groups and setting s , which concluded that  nutritional supplementation  had positive effects on  nutritional outcomes and mortality  in  elderly people  and , in some cases , clinical and functional benefits . Potter 's meta- analysis ( 10 ) of  18 trials that included older patients both in the hospital and in the community  suggested a statistically significantly  lower mortality  for the supplemented group ( odds ratio , 0.61 [ 95 % CI , 0.45 to 0.82 ] ) . A recent up date of a Cochrane review by Avenell and H and oll ( 11 ) of  nutritional supplementation  for  hip  fracture care  in older people  found some evidence that  oral protein and energy feeds  ( evaluated by 8 trials ) reduced  unfavorable outcome ( death or complications )  but did not observe a demonstrable effect on  deaths  alone . Overall , the evidence was weak because of method ologic defects in the review ed studies .  Oral nutritional supplements  are widely prescribed for older people both in the hospital and in the community . We undertook a systematic review of r and omized trials of  oral protein and energy supplementation  to assess clinical and nutritional outcomes for  older people  who are offered supplements in different setting s. Methods We identified studies and performed the analyses according to the Cochrane method ( 12 ) . The search included the following data bases : Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ( Issue 2 , 2005 ) , MEDLINE ( 1966 to June 2005 ) , EMBASE ( 1980 to March 2004 ) , HealthStar ( 1975 to March 2001 ) , CINAHL ( 1982 to March 2004 ) , BIOSIS ( 1985 to March 2004 ) , and CAB abstract s ( 1973 to March 2004 ) . We included English-  and  nonEnglish- language studies . We also h and - search ed nutrition journals and reference lists and contacted oral nutritional supplement manufacturers . We included r and omized or quasi-r and omized trials with an minimum intervention of 1 week . Groups of  study participants had to have a minimum average age of 65 years . We included all patient groups , with the exception of people in critical care or those who were recovering from cancer treatment .  We included  commercial supplements , other milk-based supplements , and fortification of normal food sources .  We excluded studies of specially design ed  immunomodulatory supplements  or  supplements of specific amino acids .  The full description of the search strategy is available elsewhere ( 13 ) . We contacted trialists for further information on ambiguous numerical data and to allow trial quality to be more accurately assessed . We examined the following outcomes as prespecified in our protocol :  all-cause mortality , number of people with morbidity or complications , length of hospital stay , functional status , participants ' perceived quality of life , percentage change in weight , percentage change in mid-arm muscle circumference , acceptance of the supplement , and adverse effects .  We included trials that reported at least 1 relevant clinical outcome measure . Two review ers independently extracted outcome data from the included trials and performed quality assessment of trials . We used a 10-item quality assessment checklist , which is based on the quality assessment tool of the Cochrane Bone , Joint and Muscle Trauma Group ( 14 ) , to rate studies between 0 and 2 points for each item , including assessment of allocation concealment , intention-to-treat analysis , and blinding of outcome assessors . We resolved all differences by discussion . Statistical Analysis We combined data for the meta- analysis for the dichotomous variables of  mortality and complications and adverse effects  by using RevMan 4.2 software ( Cochrane Collaboration , Oxford , United Kingdom ) . Low event rates pose particular problems for summarizing data in a systematic review . Default use of a correction for continuity or simply adding 0.05 to each cell when counts are less than 5.00 tends to produce biased estimates . Many methods are recommended in the literature ( 15 ) . The widely available  Peto  method ( 16 ) produces estimates without the need for 0-cell corrections , and it produces unbiased estimates when equal numbers of patients are in each group ( 17 ) . For each study , we calculated Peto odds ratios and combined the results by using fixed-effects models with 95 % confidence limits . We calculated weighted mean  difference  and  95 % CIs for length of hospital stay , percentage weight change , and percentage mid-arm muscle circumference change  by using a fixed-effects model . We explored heterogeneity between comparable trials with the I2 test ( 18 ) by using greater than 50 % as the cutoff value for statistically significant heterogeneity . When evidence suggested heterogeneity , we applied a r and om-effects model . The trials reported body  weight  and  anthropometric measures  in several ways . For meta-analyses of  weight change and mid-arm muscle circumference change  , we selected the mean and SD of the percentage weight change during the trial period because of their clinical relevance ( 19 ) . When the  percentage weight change  was not available , we calculated the difference between the  initial and final body weight  , expressed as a percentage of baseline weight and an SD of 10 % inferred . This SD was conservative and was at the upper limit of any observed result . If baseline weight was not reported , we assumed a st and ard value of 60 kg . As in Potter and colleagues ' study ( 19 ) , we chose mid-arm muscle circumference as the anthropometry measure because it is a measure of muscle . When this was not described in the trial , we derived it from the mid-arm circumference or midupper arm circumference and triceps skinfold by using a st and ard formula ( 20 ) . We performed prespecified subgroup analyses of the mortality data by comparing 1 ) baseline nutritional status as defined by the investigators (  nourished or undernourished )  , 2 )  mean age ( < 75 years or 75 years )  , 3 ) amount of kilojoules provided in the supplement ( < 1674 kJ [ < 400 kcal ] or 1674 kJ [ 400 kcal ] ) , 4 ) duration of intervention ( < 35 days or 35 days ) , and 5 )  patient health  ( well or unwell  )  . We performed an exploratory subgroup analysis for  mortality  on the basis of diagnostic group (  hip fracture , chest conditions , stroke , and congestive heart failure )  ,  geriatric conditions ( trials that included frail patients with a variety of conditions )  , and  perioperative surgical patients  . We also stratified the trials by setting ( short-term care hospital , long-term care institutions [ including nursing homes ] , and home in the community ) because we suspected differences in the nature and duration of the intervention in different setting s. Prespecified sensitivity analysis included only trials that reported clearly concealed r and omization . We evaluated the potential for publication bias by using a funnel plot . In addition , we performed a sensitivity analysis to address possible heterogeneity between findings of small and large trials ,  the latter having more than 100 participants in each group .  Role of the Funding Sources The Medical Research Council , United Kingdom ; Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Executive Health Department , United Kingdom ; and the Student Awards Agency for Scotl and , United Kingdom , funded the study . The funding sources had no role in the design , conduct , or reporting of the study or in the decision to su bmi t the paper for publication . Results Description of Studies  From more than 34000 titles or abstract s screened , we included 55 studies in  our review  (  Figure 1 ) .  The 55 studies ( 21 - 75 ) recruited 9187 participants  ( Appendix Tables 1 and 2 ) . Nearly  half of the participants were from the  recent Feed Or Ordinary Diet ( FOOD ) trial  (  37  ) of  oral nutritional supplements  for patients with stroke . Most trial participants ( 74 % ; 25 trials ) were  hospitalized  in  patients  . Fewer patients were at  home  in the community ( 16 % ; 21 trials ) or in long-stay , elderly care , or continuing care wards or nursing homes ( 10 % ; 9 trials ) .  Overall ,  most participants were patients with stroke ( 45 % ; 2 trials ) or were mixed groups with various geriatric conditions  ( 42  %  ; 33 trials ) . We also included trials of  patients with hip fracture  ( 7  %  ; 10 trials  ) , patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (  5 %  ; 7 trials  ) , surgical patients  ( 1  %  ; 2 trials  ) , and patients with congestive heart failure ( < 1 % ;  1 trial ) .

" The meta- analysis found , similar to the narrative synthesis , that  respondents  typically rated  plain packaging  as less attractive than alternative ( e.g. br and ed ) tobacco packs . However , there were several trade-offs between analysis methods in the types and bodies of evidence each one contained and in the difference between partial precision and breadth of conclusions . Analysis methods were different in respect of the role of judgement and context ual variation and in terms of estimation and unexpected effect modification . In addition , we noted that analysis methods were different in how they accounted for heterogeneity and consistency."
" It is not possible to draw firm conclusions from this review with respect to the role of mepolizumab in  patients with asthma .  Our confidence in the results of this review are limited by the fact that the intravenous route is not currently licensed for mepolizumab , and the evidence for the currently licenced subcutaneous route is limited to a single study in  participants with severe eosinophilic asthma .  The currently available studies provide evidence that mepolizumab can lead to an improvement in  health-related quality of life scores  and  reduce asthma exacerbations  in  people with severe eosinophilic asthma .  Further research is needed to clarify which subgroups of patients with asthma could potentially benefit from this treatment . Dosage , ideal dosing regimens and duration of treatment need to be clarified , as the studies included in this review differed in their protocol s. There are no studies reporting results from children , so we can not comment on treatment for this age group . At the present time , larger studies using licenced treatment regimens are required to establish the role of mepolizumab in the treatment of severe asthma."
"sPrimary  dysmenorrhea  is the most common gynecological symptom reported by women and constitutes a high health , social , and economic burden . Chemotherapies , along with their side effects , have not yielded satisfactory outcomes . Alternative  nonpharmacological  interventions , including  acupuncture and acupressure  , have been advocated , but evidence regarding their beneficial effect is inconclusive . This study sought to obtain evidence on the effectiveness of  acupuncture and acupressure interventions .   Twelve electronic data bases were search  ed by using  menstrual pain intensity  and  quality of life  as primary and secondary outcomes , respectively , with the PEDro guideline for quality appraisal . Data unsuitable for a meta- analysis were reported as descriptive data . The search yielded  38 citations  , from  which eight studies were systematic ally review ed  ,  four of  the  eight  being  eligible for meta- analysis  . The systematic review showed  moderate method ological quality  with a mean of 6.1 out of 10 on the PEDro quality scale . Acupressure showed evidence of  pain relief  while acupuncture improved both the  mental and the physical components of quality of life .  In conclusion , physiotherapists should consider using  acupuncture and acupressure  to treat  primary  dysmenorrhea   , but a need exists for higher quality , r and omized , blinded , sham-controlled trials with adequate sample sizes to establish clearly the effects of these modalities."
" In  prepubescent school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma  , a small but statistically significant group difference in  growth velocity  was observed between low doses of  ICS  and low to medium doses of  HFA-beclomethasone equivalent  , favouring the use of low-dose  ICS .  No apparent difference in the magnitude of effect was associated with three molecules reporting  one-year growth velocity  , namely ,  mometasone , ciclesonide  and  fluticasone .  In view of prevailing parents ' and physicians ' concerns about the  growth suppressive effect  of ICS , lack of or incomplete reporting of  growth velocity  in more than 86 % ( 19/22 ) of eligible paediatric trials , including those using beclomethasone and budesonide , is a matter of concern . All future paediatric trials comparing different doses of  ICS  with or without  placebo  should systematic ally document growth  .  Findings support use of the  minimal effective  ICS  dose  in children with asthma."
"sBACKGROUND Theory is often recommended as a framework for guiding hypothesized mechanisms of treatment effect . However , there is limited guidance about how to use theory in intervention development . METHODS We conducted a systematic review to provide an exemplar review evaluating the extent to which use of theory is identified and incorporated within existing interventions . We search ed electronic data bases PubMed , PsycINFO , CENTRAL , and EMBASE from  inception to May 2014 .  We search ed clinical trials.gov for registered protocol s , reference lists of relevant systematic review s and included studies , and conducted a citation search in Web of Science . We included peer-  review  ed publications of interventions that referenced the  social cognitive theory of self-regulation  as a framework for interventions to  manage chronic health conditions .  Two review ers independently assessed articles for eligibility . We contacted all authors of included studies for information detailing intervention content . We describe how often theory mechanisms were addressed by interventions , and report intervention characteristics used to address theory . RESULTS Of  202 articles that reported using the  social cognitive theory of self-regulation  , 52 % failed to incorporate self-monitoring ,  a main  theory component  , and  were  therefore  excluded .  We included  35 interventions that adequately used the theory framework .  Intervention characteristics were often poorly reported in peer- review ed publications , 21 of 35 interventions incorporated characteristics that addressed each of the main theory components . Each intervention addressed , on average , six of eight   self-monitoring mechanisms   , two of five   self-judgement mechanisms   , and one of three   self-evaluation mechanisms .   The  self-monitoring mechanisms ' Feedback ' and ' Consistency '  were addressed by all interventions , whereas the   self-evaluation  mechanisms  '  Self-incentives ' and ' External rewards '  were addressed by six and four interventions , respectively . The present review establishes that systematic review is a feasible method of identifying use of theory as a conceptual framework for existing interventions . We identified the  social cognitive theory of self-regulation  as a feasible framework to guide intervention development for chronic health conditions."

 Strong research -based evidence was found for the following : high-load dynamic warm-ups enhance  power and strength performance ;  warm-up swings with a st and ard weight baseball bat are most effective for enhancing  bat speed ;  short- duration static stretching warm-up has no effect on  power outcomes  ; and passive heating/cooling is a largely ineffective warm-up mode . A clear knowledge gap in upper body warm-up literature is the lack of investigation of injury prevention outcomes.
"XBackground : Recent studies demonstrated a 5 % increase in  cartilage repair  procedures annually in the  United States .  There is currently no consensus regarding a superior technique , nor has there been a comprehensive evaluation of postoperative clinical outcomes with respect to a minimal clinical ly important difference ( MCID ) . Purpose : To determine the proportion of available cartilage repair studies that meet or exceed MCID values for clinical outcomes improvement over short- , mid- , and long-term follow-up . Study Design : Systematic review and meta- analysis . Methods : A systematic review was performed via the Medline , Scopus , and Cochrane Library data bases . Available studies were included that investigated clinical outcomes for  microfracture ( MFX ) , osteoarticular transfer system ( OATS ) , osteochondral allograft transplantation , and autologous chondrocyte implantation/matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation ( ACI/MACI )  for the treatment of  symptomatic knee chondral defects .  Cohorts were combined on the basis of surgical intervention by performing a meta- analysis that utilized inverse-variance weighting in a DerSimonian-Laird r and om effects model . Weighted mean improvements in  International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) , Lysholm , and visual analog scale for pain ( VAS pain ) scores  were calculated from preoperative to short- ( 1 - 4 years ) , mid- ( 5 - 9 years ) , and long-term ( ≥10 years ) postoperative follow-up . Mean values were compared with established MCID values per 2-tailed 1- sample Student t tests . Results :  A total of 89 studies with 3894 unique patients  were analyzed after full-text review . MFX met MCID values for all outcome scores at short- and midterm follow-up with the  exception of VAS pain  in the midterm . OATS met MCID values for all outcome scores at all available time points ; however , long-term data were not available  for VAS pain  . Osteochondral allograft transplantation met MCID values for  IKDC  at short- and midterm follow-up and  for Lysholm  at short-term follow-up , although data were not available for other time points or  for VAS pain  . ACI/MACI met MCID values for  all outcome scores ( IKDC , Lysholm , and VAS pain )  at all time points . Conclusion : In the age of informed consent , it is important to critically evaluate the clinical outcomes and durability of cartilage surgery with respect to well-established st and ards of clinical improvement . MFX failed to  maintain VAS pain  improvements above MCID thresholds with follow-up from 5 to 9 years . All cartilage repair procedures met MCID values at short- and midterm follow-up for  IKDC and Lysholm scores ;  ACI/MACI and OATS additionally met MCID values in the long term , demonstrating extended maintenance of clinical benefits for patients undergoing these surgical interventions as compared with MFX."

"DThe association between  antipsychotics  ( also known as neuroleptics ) and  oropharyngeal dysphagia ( OD )  has been suggested in several case reports . The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effect of  antipsychotic medication  on  OD .  A systematic literature search was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines using the electronic data bases Pubmed and Embase . In Pubmed , we used the MeSH terms  ' antipsychotic agents '  OR  ' tranquilizing agents '  combined with ' deglutition disorders ' OR ' deglutition ' . In Embase , we used the Emtree terms  ' neuroleptic agents '  combined with ' swallowing ' OR ' dysphagia ' . Two review ers assessed the eligibility of each report independently . The level of evidence of the included studies was also assessed according to pre-established criteria . Case reports were excluded . We found 18 clinical studies of   dysphagia   related to   antipsychotics :  12 were related both to  typical and atypical antipsychotics  , four to  atypical antipsychotics  and two to typical  antipsychotics .   According to the clinical studies included ,  prevalence of  patients with swallowing problems  taking  antipsychotics   ranged from 21.9 to 69.5 % whereas prevalence  of  patients without swallowing problems  taking  antipsychotics   ranged from 5 to 30.5 % . The available evidence suggests considering an  etiology of dysphagia  in  patients with swallowing problems who are taking  antipsychotics   , even if no other symptoms are present . Although few general conclusions can be drawn from current evidence , both typical and atypical antipsychotics can be associated with OD."
"dObjective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of  ankle-foot orthoses  on  speed walking  in  patients with stroke .  Data sources : PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , Scopus , CENTRAL , PEDro , Rehab Data , RECAL , and ProQuest were search ed from inception until 30 September 2019 . Review methods : This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ) guideline statement . Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool . Begg ’s test and Egger ’s regression method were used to assess the publication bias . Trim and fill analysis was also used to adjust any potential publication bias . Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of individual studies . The  quality of  evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE ) criteria . Results : Overall ,  14 studies were included with a total of 1186 participants .  A small-to-moderate and non-significant improvement in favor of  the  ankle-foot orthosis versus without ankle-foot orthosis   ( st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) = 0.41 , 95 % confidence interval = −0.15 to 0.96 ) , similar  effects of  ankle-foot orthosis  and functional electrical stimulation  ( SMD = 0.00 , 95 % confidence interval = −0.16 to 0.16 ) , and a small and non-significant improvement in  favor of  ankle-foot orthosis  versus  another type of ankle-foot  orthosis  ( SMD = 0.22 , 95 % confidence interval = −0.05 to  0.49 ) in walking speed  were found . However , the quality of evidence for all comparisons was low or very low . Conclusion : Despite reported positive effects in some studies , there is no firm evidence of any  benefit of ankle-foot orthoses  on walking speed."

"sBackground This study aim ed to systematic ally review the evidence from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and to conduct a meta- analysis of the effects of  yoga  on physical and psychosocial outcomes in  cancer patients and survivors .  Methods A systematic literature search in  ten data  bases was conducted in  November 2011 . Studies were included if they had an RCT design , focused on cancer patients or survivors , included  physical postures in the yoga program   ,  compared yoga with a non-exercise or waitlist control group  , and evaluated physical and /or psychosocial outcomes . Two research ers independently rated the quality of the included RCTs , and high quality was defined as > 50 % of the total possible score .  Effect sizes ( Cohen ’s d )  were calculated for outcomes studied in more than three studies among  patients with breast cancer  using means and st and ard deviations of post-test scores of the intervention and control groups . Results  Sixteen publications of 13 RCTs met  the inclusion  criteria  , of which  one included patients with lymphomas and the others focused on patients with breast cancer .   The median quality score  was 67 % ( range : 22–89 % ) . The included studies evaluated 23  physical  and 20  psychosocial outcomes  . Of the outcomes studied in more than three studies among patients with breast cancer , we found large  reductions in distress , anxiety , and depression  ( d = −0.69 to −0.75 ) ,  moderate reductions in fatigue  ( d =  −0.51  ) ,  moderate increases in general quality of life , emotional function and social function  ( d = 0.33 to  0.49  ) , and  a small increase in functional well-being  ( d =  0.31  ) .  Effects on physical function and  sleep were small and not significant .  Conclusion Yoga  appeared to be a feasible intervention and beneficial effects on several physical and psychosocial symptoms were reported .  In patients with breast cancer   , effect  size  on  functional well-being was small , and they were moderate to large for psychosocial outcomes."
"sAlthough the majority of  patients with psoriasis vulgaris  are treated exclusively with topical therapies , research to develop more effective topical therapies that are associated with higher patient satisfaction has lagged behind the development of systemic agents . The aim of this literature review was to determine whether there is documented evidence that applying an innovative approach to improving the formulation of active ingredients commonly used in the topical treatment of psoriasis can have a positive effect on  clinical outcomes  and  patient-reported outcomes ( PROs )  . The Embase and PubMed data bases were search ed for  articles published between 2001 and 2016  that made direct head-to-head comparisons of different formulations of an  active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API  ) , focusing on clinical outcomes and PROs . In total ,  22 publications on APIs or API combinations met the eligibility criteria ( 19 head-to-head clinical trials , one pooled analysis  ,  one health-economic  modelling study and  one systematic review )  . Significant  clinical  benefit associated with the use of a reformulated API over an older formulation was reported in three trials of  clobetasol propionate  , one trial of  calcipotriol  , three trials of  betamethasone  and five trials/pooled analyses of  calcipotriol/calcipotriene + betamethasone dipropionate  ( Cal/BD ) formulations . Significantly  improved PROs  associated with the use of a reformulated API over an older formulation were reported in three trials of  clobetasol propionate  , one trial of  betamethasone valerate  and two trials of Cal/BD formulations . These results demonstrate that the innovative reformulation of APIs used in the treatment of psoriasis can produce therapies that attain significantly  improved clinical outcomes and PROs .  This suggests that improvement in topical therapy for psoriasis need not only to be achieved by the identification of new targets and the development of new APIs , but that improvement in the vehicle used to deliver existing APIs has the potential to result in significant clinical and patient benefits."
"eThe traditional goals of  Crohn  's  disease therapy  , to induce and maintain clinical remission , have not clearly changed its natural history . In contrast , emerging evidence suggests that achieving and maintaining mucosal healing may alter the natural history of  Crohn 's disease  , as it has been associated with more sustained clinical remission and reduced rates of  hospitalization  and  surgical resection .  Induction and maintenance of mucosal healing should therefore be a goal toward which therapy is now directed . Unresolved issues pertain to the benefit of achieving mucosal healing at different stages of the disease , the relationship between mucosal healing and transmural inflammation , the intensity of treatment needed to achieve mucosal healing when it has not been obtained using  st and ard therapy  , and the means by which  mucosal healing  is defined using current endoscopic disease activity indices . The main clinical challenge relates to defining the means of achieving  high rates of mucosal healing  in clinical practice."
"hIntroduction This systematic review and meta- analysis aims to characterize the surgically important benefits and complications associated with the use of  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  for the treatment of both  resectable and initially unresectable pancreatic cancer .  Studies were identified through a systematic literature search and analyzed by two independent review ers .  Survival , peri-operative complications , death rate , pancreatic fistula rate , and the incidence of involved surgical margins  were analyzed and subject to meta- analysis . Methods  Nineteen studies , involving 2,148 patients were identified .  Only cohort studies were included . Results The meta- analysis found that  patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer  who underwent  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  achieved similar  survival outcomes  to patients with resectable disease , even though only 40 % were ultimately resected .  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the  rate of pancreatic fistula formation or total complications .  Conclusion Patients receiving  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  were less likely to have a  positive resection margin  , although there was an increase in the risk of peri-operative death."
"sAdolescent  and young adult ( AYA ) cancer patients  experience unique psychosocial needs and developmental challenges . A cancer diagnosis can stress this development and disrupt AYAs in their normal life . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to assess the impact of  psychosocial  interventions   on  mental health  in AYAs . A literature research was conducted , which result ed in  twelve eligible studies .  The st and ardized mean difference between intervention and control conditions was 0.13 ( 95 % CI : -0.16 to 0.42 ) for  quality of life  , 0.27 ( 95 % CI : -0.22 to 0.76 ) for  cancer-related knowledge  and -0.16 ( 95 % CI : -0.73 to 0.42 ) on  psychological distress  indicating , small and non-significant effects for interventions improving mental health . This work strengthens the need for age-appropriated interventions in psycho-oncology . Future research should develop interventions more graduated by age .

" Successful interactions between  patients and their practitioners  lie at the heart of medicine , yet there are few rigorous trials of well-specified interventions to inform best practice . Trial evidence suggests that a range of approaches can achieve changes in this interaction , and some show promise in improving patients ’ health  .  To advance knowledge further , we need to replicate promising studies using rigorous methods . These should include explicit theoretical frameworks design ed to link effects on key communication and interaction characteristics through to effects on health outcomes."
eThis paper examines some of the problems specifically associated with conducting  research into  acupuncture   and how this can lead to further problems with subsequent systematic review s.  Studies  for  the treatment of chronic neck pain  have been used as examples of how presented information can be misleading to an acupuncture-naive reader and how research ers must be sensitive to these problems when compiling their inclusion and exclusion criteria . The problems associated with scoring  trials  are discussed and further work to increase the scope of scoring mechanisms is recommended in order to produce meaningful systematic review s in the future.
"eContext  Ventilation  strategies to protect the lungs of  patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS )  include  low  tidal volume  , limited  airway  pressures  , and  medium to high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP )  , but the adoption of these strategies has been slow in some clinical setting s. Contribution This review of r and omized trial evidence for  low tidal volume and high PEEP ventilation  on mortality of  patients with ARDS or acute lung injury  found that trials were limited in number but showed mortality benefits with lower versus higher tidal volume . High PEEP did not improve mortality in unselected patients but may help patients with life-threatening hypoxemia despite other interventions . Implication  Lower tidal volume ventilation  strategies should be used for  patients with ARDS or acute lung injury .  The Editors The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is clinical ly characterized by sudden onset , severe hypoxemia , radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltration , and absence of left heart failure ( 13 ) . Acute lung injury is a subset of ARDS with less severe impairment in oxygenation . Despite apparent improvement in management and outcome of ARDS , the  mortality rate  in persons with the disease remains high , ranging from 35 % to 65 % ( 4 ) . Although  mechanical ventilation  provides essential life support , it can worsen  lung injury  ( 5 ) . Computed tomography images of patients with ARDS show  nonhomogeneous distribution of pulmonary aeration .  Normally aerated lung regions are relatively small but , when they receive the largest part of tidal volume ( Vt ) ( 6 , 7 ) , may be exposed to excessive alveolar wall tension and stress because of overdistention ( 8 , 9 ) . Atelectatic lung regions are prone to cyclic recruitment and derecruitment , leading to  shear stress  in adjacent aerated and nonaerated alveoli ( 1012 ) .  Ventilator-induced lung injury  is caused by excessive stress or strain to lung tissues that occurs during mechanical  ventilation  and aggravates  inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage  ( 5 , 13 ) .  Lung-protective ventilation strategies  include  ventilation with low Vt  and  limited airway pressure  to reduce  ventilator-induced lung injury  from overdistention while allowing hypercapnia and medium to high positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) to keep alveoli open throughout the ventilator cycle ( 14 ) . Hypercapnia and  acidosis  may  increase intracranial pressure , induce pulmonary hypertension , depress myocardial contractility , decrease renal blood flow , and release endogenous catecholamines  ( 15 ) . In addition , prevention of cyclic derecruitment with higher PEEP may contribute to overdistention of normally aerated alveoli , counterbalancing the benefits from low Vt and limited airway pressure ventilation cycles ( 14 ) . The effect of different  lung-protective ventilatory strategies  in  patients with acute lung injury or ARDS  has been investigated in r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) testing higher versus  lower Vt ventilation  at similar PEEP ( 1619 ) , higher versus  lower PEEP  strategies during  low Vt  ventilation ( 2022 ) , and lower Vt and PEEP titrated greater than the lower inflection point of the individual pressure volume curve versus higher Vt and lower PEEP ( 23 , 24 ) . Results were partially conflicting because of differences in study design and number of enrolled patients . This may explain why most  critically ill patients  are still ventilated with high Vt at lower or even no PEEP ( 4 , 25 ) . Our objective was to determine whether the different  lung-protective ventilatory  strategies improve outcome in  critically ill adults with acute lung injury or ARDS .  Methods Data Sources and Search es We aim ed to identify all RCTs assessing the efficacy and outcomes of  lower Vt ventilation , higher PEEP application , or a combination of  both in  adults with acute lung injury or ARDS .  The electronic search strategy applied st and ard filters for identification of RCTs . We search ed the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , MEDLINE ( from inception to March 2009 ) , and EMBASE ( from inception to March 2009 ) . Our search included the following keywords : acute lung injury , ALI , adult respiratory distress syndrome , ARDS , protective ventilation , lung protective ventilation strategy , pressure-limited ventilation , tidal volume , positive end-expiratory pressure , PEEP , and r and om . We did not apply language restrictions . In addition to the electronic search , we checked out cross-references from original articles and review s. Selection of Studies We restricted the analysis to RCTs to guarantee control of selection bias . We did not include study design s containing inadequately adjusted planned co- interventions and quasi-r and omized or crossover trials . We considered RCTs that reported  mortality  as a predefined end point and compared  lower  versus  higher Vt ventilation  ,  lower  versus  higher PEEP application  , or  a combination of  these strategies in  intubated and mechanically ventilated critically ill adults with acute lung injury or ARDS  from  any  cause . Acute lung injury and ARDS had to be defined by the American-European Consensus Conference criteria ( 26 ) or by the Lung Injury Severity Score ( 27 ) . Trials with a  low Vt ventilation  strategy had to use lower Vt , maximal inspiratory plateau pressure ( Pei ) of 30 cm H2O or less , or a combination , which result ed in Vt of 8 mL/kg of body weight or less , compared with  conventional mechanical ventilation  that used Vt ranging between 10 and 15 mL/kg . Regardless of the strategy used to deliver the lower Vt , the 2 study groups had to differ only for Vt and not for other variables associated with a low Vt ventilation strategy . Trials with high PEEP ventilation strategies had to use higher PEEP based on Fio 2PEEP scales , titrating PEEP to greater than the lower inflection point of the individual static or quasi-static pressure volume curve at enrollment or titrating PEEP as high as possible without increasing the maximal Pei to greater than 30 cm H2O compared with  conventional mechanical ventilation  that used lower PEEP based on fixed Fio 2PEEP scales or lower PEEP at higher Fio 2 to ensure adequate arterial oxygenation . We  excluded studies in postoperative patients and those published only in abstract form .  We contacted authors to clarify details of trials when necessary . Outcome Measures The primary outcome was  mortality , evaluated at hospital discharge .  Secondary outcomes included  mortality at the end of the planned follow-up , barotrauma , use of rescue therapies owing to life-threatening hypoxemia , ventilator setting s , and pulmonary function variables . Barotrauma  was defined as any new  pneumothorax , pneumomediastinum , subcutaneous emphysema , or pneumatocele  after r and om assignment . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Two pairs of independent review ers performed the initial selection by screening titles and abstract s. Citations were selected for further evaluation if the studies they referred to were RCTs of lung-protective ventilatory strategies in  critical ill adults  or if the title or abstract did not give enough information to make an assessment . For detailed evaluation , we obtained the full text of all possibly relevant studies . Data from each study were extracted independently by the paired review ers by using a prest and ardized data abstract ion form . One pair of review ers was not informed about authors , journal , institutional affiliation , and date of publication . Data extracted from the publications were checked by another review er for accuracy . Quality assessment of these studies included use of r and omization , reporting of allocation concealment , blinding , adequate selection and description of study population with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria , similarity of the groups at baseline , use of a predefined treatment protocol , absence of confounders , absence of co- interventions , a priori definition of primary and secondary outcome variables , use of intention-to-treat analysis , extent of follow-up , a priori calculation of sample size , number of  patients screened  and included in the trial , reports on patients lost to follow-up , and planned or premature termination of the RCT . Two review ers independently used these criteria to abstract trial quality . We resolved any disagreements by consensus in consultation with a third review er if needed . Data Synthesis and Analysis We studied the following comparisons :  lower versus higher Vt ventilation  using similar  PEEP  strategies ,  lower versus higher PEEP level during low Vt ventilation  , and the  combination of higher Vt and lower PEEP level versus lower Vt and higher PEEP level .  Qualitative Analysis We used a narrative summary approach to describe study characteristics and variation in  quality indicators  among studies and to consider how these factors affect our underst and ing of the outcomes of the RCTs included in the Cochrane review ( 28 , 29 ) . Quantitative Analysis The meta- analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines ( 30 ) . All statistical analyses were performed with Review Manager , version 4.2 ( The Nordic Cochrane Center , Copenhagen , Denmark ) , the Cochrane Collaboration 's software for preparing and maintaining Cochrane systematic review s ( 30 ) . The pooled effects estimates for binary variables were expressed as odds ratios with 95 % CIs , whereas continuous variables were expressed as weighted mean differences with 95 % CIs . We tested the difference in estimates of treatment effect between the treatment and control groups for each hypothesis by using a 2-sided z test with statistical significance considered at a P value of less than 0.05 . We examined heterogeneity by using the Cochran Q and the I 2 test ( 31 , 32 ) . We predefined heterogeneity as low , moderate , and high , with I 2 statistics greater than 25 % , 50 % , and 75 % , respectively ( 32 ) . Meta- analysis with a r and om-effects model was applied with I 2 statistics greater than 25 % ( 33 ) . Otherwise , we performed meta- analysis by using a fixed-effects model . However , the."

" Three BCTs have potential promise for use in future interventions to increase  physical activity  among PWD . Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject ? While physical activity is a key lifestyle factor to enhance and maintain health and wellbeing amongst the general population , adults rarely participate in sufficient levels to obtain these benefits . Systematic review s suggest that  specific behaviour change techniques  can  increase physical activity  , although one review suggested that  self-regulatory techniques  may be counterproductive when promoting physical activity among  older people .  Until now , no systematic review has been conducted to assess which behaviour change techniques may be associated with greater  participation in physical activity  among  people with dementia .  What does this study add ? Interventions showed mixed promise for increasing  physical activity  and little effect on  participant adherence  . Goal setting ( behaviour ) , social support ( unspecified ) , and using a credible source are promising approaches . No technique showed promise for increasing adherence to physical  activity interventions  among people with dementia."
" This is the first meta- analysis to examine gynaecological  cancers  in  women with PCOS younger than 54 years of age compared  with  controls of similar age  . Current data suggest that  women  of all  ages with  PCOS are at an  increased risk of endometrial  cancer but the  risk of ovarian and breast cancer  was not significantly increased overall . These results highlight the potential risk of gynaecological cancer morbidities associated with PCOS . However , the available evidence is far from robust and variation in diagnostic criteria for PCOS , associated risk factors ( particularly obesity ) , and selection bias in the studies may have result ed in an exaggeration of the increased risk . Furthermore ,  women who have PCOS  should also be made aware that any increased risk for  endometrial cancer  must be judged in the context of its relatively low incidence in the general population . A large well-controlled prospect i ve study is required in order to gain a more accurate estimate of the  risk of gynaecological cancers  in  women with  PCOS .

"dAIM The aim of this study was to analyse the evidence of  effectiveness  on  adult stroke patients of the  Constraint Induced Movement Therapy ( CIMT )   , an original rehabilitation method that consists in strongly encouraging patients to use the affected arm , mainly immobilising the unaffected arm . METHODS We only took into account the  r and omised controlled trials on  CIMT   where the experimental treatment was compared with a  conventional  treatment without any discrepancy of organization or session duration . As we could not measure the statistical significance of differences between treated and control patients , we compared their respective post-treatment percent changes and computed the  minimal clinical ly important difference ( MCID )  , defined as a change of at least 10 % of the maximum score of the scale used . RESULTS The literature search found  13 r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs  ) , 4 of which were excluded because they aim ed at comparing different  intensity of  CIMT .   The 9 RCTs finally included into the review applied the  CIMT  in either acute , subacute or chronic stroke patients and according to different modalities . Findings were positive in all studies , but the  MCID  was reached only in smaller ones , which may have been influenced by patients ' characteristics .  Although all studies achieved positive results , it is impossible to draw any clear-cut conclusion on the  effectiveness of the  CIMT .   The main limitations are the lack of homogeneity in the outcome measures used , the inadequacy of data provided and the small sample s ' size . Multicentre studies , using robust outcome measures and considering both motor- and sensory-disabled patients are needed."

"ePURPOSE This study was a systematic review and meta- analysis design ed to evaluate the effects of   breastfeeding intervention  on  breastfeeding rates .   METHODS Based on the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-analyses ( PRISMA ) , a systematic search was conducted using  eight core  electronic data bases and other sources including gray literature from  January 9 to 19  ,  2017  . Two review ers independently select the studies and assessed method ological  risk of  bias of studies using the Cochrane criteria . The topics of  breastfeeding interventions  were analyzed using descriptive analysis and the effects of intervention were meta-analyzed using the Review Manager 5.2 software . RESULTS A  total of 16 studies were included in the review and 15 were included for meta- analysis .  The most frequently used intervention topics were the  importance of good latch-on and frequency of feeding  and  determining adequate intake  followed . The  pooled total effect  of breastfeeding  intervention  was 1.08 ( 95 % CI 1.03~1.13 ) . In the subgroup analysis , neither pre-nor post-childbirth intervention was effective on  the breastfeeding rates  at 1 , 3 , and 6 months , and neither group nor individual interventions had an effect . Only the  1 month breastfeeding rate  was found to be affected by the  individual intervention  with the persistent strategies 1.21 ( 95 % CI 1.04~1.40 ) .   Effective breastfeeding interventions  are needed to help the  mother  to start breastfeeding after childbirth and continue for at least six months . It should be programmed such that individuals can acquire information and specific breastfeeding skills . After returning home , there should be continuous support strategies for breastfeeding as well as managing various difficulties related to childcare."

The  three EPCs are Southern California/R AND , Tufts-New Engl and Medical Center , and the University of Ottawa ( UO ) EPC .  To ensure consistency of approach , the three EPCs collaborated on selected method ological elements , including literature search strategies , rating of evidence , and data table design . Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways leading to airways hyperresponsiveness and associated symptoms such as wheezing and coughing , and is also typically associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment . The inflammatory process is a complex one , involving a multitude of cell types and activities marking the early and late phase asthmatic responses . There are important issues requiring careful consideration in diagnosing asthma , including the need to distinguish it from  transient wheezing disorders in children , especially under the age of 5 years  , and also from  chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder  ,  especially in older adults who are current or ex-smokers .  Various strategies have been developed to manage  asthma .  Since airway inflammation is multifactorial , involving various cell types and mediators , the drugs used to decrease inflammation may act at several different steps in the inflammatory process . Agents that modify the asthma process , with some influencing inflammation , include :  beta-2 adrenergic agonists , corticosteroids , leukotriene modifiers , mast-cell stabilizing agents ,  and  theophylline .  Considerable interest in the possible value of  omega-3 fatty acid supplementation  in asthma was sparked by Horrobin ’s hypothesis that the low incidence of asthma in  Eskimos  stems from their consumption of large quantities of  oily fish  , rich in  omega-3 fatty acids .  Additional impetus for research came from observations that  omega-3 fatty acids  ’ possible protective , or even therapeutic , effect might be afforded by their impact on mediators of inflammation thought to be related to the pathogenesis of asthma."
" Although music interventions show promising results in some studies , the variation in quality of the studies , age groups , outcome measures and timing of the interventions across the studies makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions on the effects of music in premature infants."
  Physical training  improves  cardiopulmonary fitness  without changing lung function . It is not clear if the improvement in fitness translates into a reduction in  symptoms  or an improvement in the  quality of life .  There is a need for further r and omised controlled trials of the effects of  physical training  in the management of asthma.
"nBackground Snoring is the sound produced by the vibration of the soft tissues caused by the air passing through a narrow upper airway during sleep . It is usually associated with the conditions that increase upper airway resistance , but can occur in their absence too (  primary  snoring ) . Considering its sheer prevalence , the associated comorbidities , like carotid atherosclerosis and the social disorder that it can represent , treatment for snoring must be considered even in the absence of any other medical condition . Treatment options include conservative approaches like  weight reduction , smoking and alcohol cessation , sleep positioning , mechanical nasal dilators , and continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP )  to more radical approaches like  surgery .  Till date , we have no drugs for treating the primary pathology of snoring . Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in PUBMED and EMBASE , and we found only nine r and omized control trial ’s and one interventional study focusing on the pharmacotherapy of snoring per se , even as the literature is replete with studies evaluating drug therapy for obstructive  sleep  apnea . Result Drugs evaluated include  protriptyline , pseudoephedrine and domperidone , mometasone , nasal surfactant , Botulinum toxin type A , and some homeopathic and oil-based nasal sprays .  The selected studies showed no strength in data and had a great method ological heterogeneity , so it is impossible to compare the analyzed studies . Discussion Even though there are no consistent data to support pharmacologic treatment for  primary snoring  , through the critical analysis of these studies , we have discussed about the future directions for clinical trials in this area to arrive at a clinical ly meaningful decision."
" From the available RCTs , we found insufficient evidence that  hysterectomy with radiotherapy , with or without chemotherapy  , improves the survival of  women with locally advanced cervical cancer who are treated with  radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy  alone .  The overall quality of the evidence was variable across the different outcomes and was universally down grade d due to concerns about risk of bias . The quality of the evidence for  neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical hysterectomy versus radiotherapy alone  for  survival  outcomes was moderate , with evidence from other comparisons of low quality . This was mainly based on poor reporting and sparseness of data where results were based on single trials . More trials that assess medical management with and without hysterectomy may test the robustness of the findings of this review as further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect."
"nOBJECTIVE : A systematic review of the published literature was performed to assess the prevalence , incidence , natural history , and comorbid conditions of  functional constipation in children .  METHODS : Articles were identified through electronic search es in Medline , Embase , Cochrane Central Library , Cinhal and PsychInfo data bases . Study selection criteria included : ( 1 ) epidemiology  studies of general population , ( 2 ) on the prevalence of constipation without obvious organic etiology , ( 3 ) in children from 0 to 18 yr old , and ( 4 ) published in English and full manuscript form .  RESULTS :  Eighteen studies met  our inclusion criteria . The  prevalence of  childhood constipation   in the general  population  ranged from 0.7 % to 29.6 % ( median 8.9 ; inter quartile range 5.3–17.4 ) . The  prevalence of constipation  defined as  defecation frequency  of < 3/wk varied from 0.7 % to 29.6 % ( median 10.4 ; inter quartile range 1.3–21.3 ) . Identified studies originated from  North America ( N = 4 )  ,  South America ( N = 2  ) ,  Europe ( N = 9 )  , the  Middle-East ( N = 1  ) , and  Asia ( N = 2  ) . Variance of  gender specific prevalence  was reported in seven studies and five of seven studies reported no significant difference between boys and girls . The age group in which  constipation  is most common could not be assessed with certainty . Socioeconomic factors were not found to be associated with constipation .  :   Childhood constipation   is a common problem worldwide . Most studies report similar  prevalence  rates for  boys and girls  . Large epidemiologic studies with the use of generally accepted diagnostic criteria are needed to define the precise prevalence of constipation."

"sFLOT regimen became the st and ard perioperative treatment in several centers around the world for  esophagogastric tumors  despite concerns about toxicity . In addition ,  FLOT  has never been compared with other  docetaxel-based  regimens . To address this question , we conducted a systematic review of PubMed , Embase and Web of Science including prospect i ve or retrospective studies of   docetaxel  based  perioperative regimen  in gastric and esophagogastric tumors .  Data regarding chemotherapy regimens  , efficacy and toxicity  were extracted . Outcomes were compared using a r and om effects model .  Of 548 abstract s , 16 were considered eligible .  Comparing the studies with meta- analysis we can see that the regimens are similar in terms of  pathological complete response , resection rate , progression free survival and overall survival  in one year , without significant heterogeneity . The meta-regression of  docetaxel  dose failed to show any association with dose ranging between 120–450 mg/m² . Regarding  the toxicity  of the regimens it is noted that the regimens are  quite toxic  ( up to 50–70 % of grade 3–4 neutropenia ) . The results of this meta- analysis with a combined sample size of more than  1,000 patients  suggest  that docetaxel perioperative regimens  are equivalent in outcomes . Prospect i ve trials addressing modified regimens should be performed to provide  less toxic strategies  and be applicable to all patients."
"sUNLABELLED In this systematic review , we compared the effectiveness of  media-based  patient education   about   anesthesia .  Fifteen r and omized controlled trials ( n = 1506 )  were identified after a systematic search of electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PSYCINFO , The Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry ) , published articles , and contact with authors . Outcomes assessed were  anxiety , knowledge , and patient satisfaction . Anxiety levels  before anesthesia were less intense in subjects receiving the  video and printed information  compared with those receiving  no intervention  ( weighted mean difference of 3 ; 95 % confidence interval [ 95%CI ] , 1 - 5 Spielberger 's State and Trait Anxiety Inventory ) . Patients in the video group were more likely to  answer all knowledge questions correctly  compared with patients with no intervention ( relative risk of 6.64 ; 95%CI , 2.05 - 21.52 ) . The  level of knowledge about pain management  was higher in the video group compared with patients with no intervention ( weighted mean difference of 17 % ; 95%CI , 9 - 25 ) . However , the  level of patient satisfaction  with the intervention ( expectation versus actual anesthetic experience ) was similar between the groups ( relative risk of 1.06 ; 95%CI , 0.93 - 1.22 ) . This systematic review supports the use of  video and printed information about general process and risks of anesthesia  for patient education before surgery . IMPLICATION S The effectiveness of media-based interventions for educating  patients  about general process and risks of anesthesia were compared in this systematic review . The use of  video  and /or  printed information  can decrease  patient anxiety and increase patient knowledge .  However ,  patient satisfaction  was similar between media-based intervention and nonintervention groups."
" This review is the most comprehensive summary of the evidence assessing the benefits and harms of  intermittent iron supplementation  in  pregnant women on haematological and pregnancy outcomes .  Findings suggest that intermittent regimens produced similar  maternal and infant outcomes  as daily supplementation but were associated with  fewer side effects  and reduced the risk of  high levels of Hb  in mid and late pregnancy , although the risk of  mild anaemia  near term was increased . While the quality of the evidence was assessed as low or very low , intermittent may be a feasible alternative to daily iron supplementation among those pregnant women who are not anaemic and have adequate antenatal care."

"yObjective : To systematic ally review the evidence on the effect of  constraint-induced movement therapy  compared with  bimanual intensive training  in  children with unilateral cerebral palsy .  Data sources : Seven electronic data bases ( Cinahl , Cochrane Library , EMBASE , Ovid MEDLINE , PEDro , PsycINFO , PubMed ) were search ed from data base inception through December 2016 . Methods : A systematic review was performed using the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis guidelines .  St and ardised mean differences ( effect sizes )  were calculated for each study and outcome . Results :  Nine studies met  the eligibility criteria . All studies provided level II evidence . Method ological quality was high in two studies , moderate in four studies and low in three studies . The methodology , participant and intervention characteristics were heterogeneous . The  participants ’ ages ranged from 1.5 to 16 years . Their initial h and function ranged from Manual Ability Classification System Level I to Level III .  The total intervention dose ranged from 24 to 210 hours and duration from one week to ten weeks . The studies measured outcomes  assessing unimanual and bimanual h and and arm function , participation and attainment of individualised goals .  Overall , the  effect  sizes did not favour one of the interventions at short- or long-term follow-up . The 95 % confidence intervals were broad , indicating inaccurate precision of the effect sizes . Pooling of the data for a meta- analysis was judged to be of little clinical value owing to heterogeneity . Conclusion : It is not possible to conclude whether  constraint-induced movement therapy or bimanual intensive training  is more effective than the other in children with unilateral cerebral palsy."
"sObjectives The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis in  patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA )  , evaluating effects of  topical nasal steroids  on continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) machine use and nasal symptoms . Search methods Data source : A comprehensive search of Pubmed , Scopus , Web of Science , and the Cochrane Library was performed through April 2016 . Manual search es and subject matter expert input were also obtained . Studies assessing effects of  nasal steroids  on CPAP machine use  in adults  , which reported quantitative outcome data of CPAP compliance , were included . Results  Two studies ( 144 patients ) met inclusion criteria .  Both were r and omized , placebo-controlled clinical trials ( RCT ) . Pooled fixed effects analysis did not identify a statistically significant difference between both the groups  for average duration of CPAP machine use per night .  But there was an overall increase in the usage of 0.4 h ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( −0.20 , 1.00 ) ; P = 0.19 ) in favor  of nasal steroids  .  Difference of percentage of nights with CPAP use  was not demonstrated ( mean difference 0.06 , 95 % CI ( −0.27 , 0.39 ) ; P = 0.71 ) . There was also no significant  difference in nasal symptoms  ( mean difference 0.63 , 95 % CI ( −0.11 , 1.36 ) , P = 0.1  )  .  Conclusion Nasal steroids  showed benefits on CPAP use , but did not reach statistical significance . Data was based on meta- analysis of RCTs of 4-week follow-up in unselected  OSA patients .  Future controlled studies with selected group and longer follow-up duration are needed to confirm the  benefits of nasal steroid  on CPAP compliance in OSA patients."
"  Patients with HRPC  have not traditionally been offered chemotherapy as a routine treatment because of  treatment-related toxicity  and  poor responses .  Recent data from r and omised studies , in particular those using  docetaxel  , have provided encouraging improvements in  overall survival , palliation of symptoms , and improvements in quality of life .   Chemotherapy  should be considered as a treatment option for  patients with HRPC .  However , patients should make an informed decision based on the risks and benefits of chemotherapy."
  Combination therapy with ADA and immunomodulator  was  mildly superior  to  ADA  monotherapy for  induction of remission  in CD  .  The  rate of remission at 1 year  and the need for dose escalation were similar in both groups . These findings should be interpreted with caution in view of possible confounders and should be further vali date d by r and omized controlled trials.
"dBackground In many industrialized countries routine vaccination with the  23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPSV-23 )  is recommended to prevent pneumococcal disease in the elderly . However , vaccine-induced immunity wanes after a few years , and there are controversies around revaccination with  PPSV-23 .  Here , we systematic ally assessed the effectiveness and safety of  PPSV-23  revaccination . Method We conducted a systematic literature review in MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to June 2015 . We included all study types that compared effectiveness , immunogenicity and /or safety of  PPSV-23  as a primary vs. a revaccination dose in  persons aged 50 years and older .  With respect to immunogenicity , we calculated the ratio of geometric mean antibody concentrations and opsonophagocytic indexes at identical time-points after primary and revaccination . Additionally , we compared rates and  severity of adverse events  ( AEs ) after primary and revaccination . Results We included  14 observational studies .  10 studies had a prospect i ve design and analysed data on ( i ) the same individuals after a first and a second dose of  PPSV-23  given 1 to 10 years later ( n = 5 ) or ( ii ) two groups consisting of participants receiving   PPSV-23  who were either vaccine-naïve or had received a first   PPSV-23   dose  3 to 13 years earlier ( n = 5 ) . Three studies used electronic data bases to compare  AEs  after primary vs. revaccination doses of  PPSV-23  after 1 to 10 years and one study had a cross-sectional design .  Number of participants in the non-register-based and register-based studies ranged from 29 to 1414 and 360 to 316,000  , respectively . 11 out of 14 included studies were at high risk of bias , three studies had an unclear risk of bias . None of the studies reported data on  clinical effectiveness .  Immunogenicity studies revealed that during the first two months  antibody levels  tended to be lower after revaccination as compared to primary vaccination . Thereafter , no obvious  differences in antibody levels  were observed . Compared to primary vaccination , revaccination was associated with an increased  risk of local and systemic AEs  , which , however , were usually mild and self-limiting . The  risk and severity of AEs  appeared to decrease with longer intervals between primary and revaccination . Conclusion Data comparing the effectiveness of primary vs. revaccination with  PPSV-23  are still lacking , because there are no studies with clinical endpoints . Data from observational studies indicates that revaccination with PPSV-23 is likely to induce  long-term antibody levels  that are comparable to those after primary vaccination . Given the high disease burden and the waning of vaccine-induced immunity ,  revaccination with PPSV-23  could be considered in the  elderly  . The increased risk of  local and systemic AEs  can likely be mitigated when giving revaccination at least five years after the primary dose . Adequately powered r and omized controlled trials using clinical endpoints are urgently needed."

")Background  Expressive writing  involves writing about stressful or traumatic experiences . Despite trials in people  with advanced disease  , no systematic review to date has critiqued the evidence on  expressive writing  in this population . To synthesis e the evidence of the effects of  expressive writing  on  pain , sleep , depression and anxiety  in  people with advanced disease .  Methods A systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines . CINAHL , CENTRAL , PsycINFO and PubMed were search ed from January 1986 to March 2018 . Other sources included clinical data registers and conference proceedings .  Studies were included  if  they were r and omised  controlled trials that assessed the impact of an intervention involving  expressive writing  for  adults with advanced disease  and /or studies involving  linguistic analysis on the expressive writing output .  Method ological  quality  was assessed using the  Cochrane risk of bias tool  and the  Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool  . The  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation tool  was used to assess the level of evidence for the outcomes of interest . The protocol of this systematic review has been registered on PROSPERO ( CRD42017058193 ) . Results  Six eligible studies with a total of 288 participants were identified ,  including  four r and omised controlled trials . All of the trials were in cancer and recruited predominantly women .  None of the interventions were tailored to the population . Studies had method ological shortcomings and evidence was generally of low quality . Combined analysis of the four trials , involving  214 participants in total  , showed no clear difference in the effect of   expressive writing   on  sleep , anxiety or depression  compared to an active control . Pain was not evaluated in the trials . In contrast , analysis of the four studies that included linguistic analysis alluded to linguistic mechanisms for potential effects . Conclusion Although the trial results suggest there is no benefit in  expressive writing  for  people with advanced disease  , the current evidence is limited . There is a need for more rigorous trials . It would be of benefit first to undertake exploratory research in trial design including how best to measure impact and in tailoring of the intervention to address the specific needs of  people with advanced disease .

"yAim : To investigate the effectiveness of  self-directed arm interventions  in  adult stroke survivors .  Methods : A systematic review of Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , SCOPUS and IEEE Xplore up to February 2018 was carried out . Studies of  stroke  arm interventions were included where more than 50 % of the time spent in therapy was initiated and carried out by the participant .  Quality of the evidence  was assessed using the  Cochrane risk of  bias  tool  . Results :  A total of 40 studies ( n = 1172 participants ) were included  ( 19 r  and omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) and 21 before – after studies ) . Studies were grouped according to no technology or the main additional technology used (  no technology  n = 5 ;  interactive gaming  n = 6 ;  electrical stimulation  n = 11 ;  constraint-induced movement therapy  n = 6 ;  robotic and dynamic orthotic devices  n = 8 ;  mirror therapy  n = 1 ;  telerehabilitation  n = 2 ;  wearable devices  n = 1 ) . A  beneficial effect on arm function  was found  for self-directed interventions using constraint-induced movement therapy  ( n = 105 ; st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) 0.39 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) −0.00 to  0.78  ) and  electrical stimulation  ( n = 94 ; SMD 0.50 , 95 % CI 0.08–0.91  ) . Constraint-induced movement therapy and therapy programmes  without technology  improved independence in activities of daily living  . Sensitivity analysis  demonstrated arm function benefit  for patients > 12 months poststroke ( n = 145 ; SMD 0.52 , 95 % CI 0.21–0.82 ) but not at 0–3 , 3–6 or 6–12 months . Conclusion :  Self-directed interventions  can  enhance arm recovery  after stroke but the effect varies according to the approach used and timing . There were benefits identified  from self-directed delivery of constraint-induced movement therapy , electrical stimulation and therapy programmes  that increase practice without using additional technology."

"yBACKGROUND  Influenza vaccination  is a commonly used intervention to prevent influenza infection in  healthcare workers ( HCWs )  and onward transmission to other staff and patients . We undertook a systematic review to synthesize the latest evidence of the direct epidemiological and economic effectiveness of seasonal  influenza vaccination  among  HCW .  METHODS We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE / PubMed , Scopus , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  from 1980 through January 2018 .  All  studies comparing vaccinated and  non-vaccinated  ( i.e.  placebo or non-intervention  ) groups of HCWs were included .  Research articles that focused on only patient-related outcomes or monovalent  A(H1N1)pdm09  vaccines were excluded . Two review ers independently selected articles and extracted data . Pooled-analyses were conducted on  morbidity outcomes including laboratory-confirmed influenza , influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) , and absenteeism . Economic studies  were summarized for the characteristics of methods and findings . RESULTS  Thirteen articles  met eligibility criteria : three articles were r and omized controlled studies and ten were cohort studies . Pooled results showed a significant effect on  laboratory-confirmed influenza incidence  but not  ILI .  While the  overall incidence of absenteeism  was not changed by vaccine ,  ILI absenteeism  was significantly reduced . The  duration of absenteeism  was also shortened by vaccination . All published economic evaluations consistently found that the immunization of HCW was  cost saving  based on crude estimates of avoided absenteeism by vaccination . No studies , however , comprehensively evaluated both  health outcomes and costs of vaccination  programs to examine cost-effectiveness . DISCUSSION Our findings reinforced the influenza  vaccine  effects in reducing  infection incidence and length of absenteeism .  A better underst and ing of the incidence of absenteeism and comprehensive economic program evaluations are required to ensure the best possible management of ill  HCWs  and the investment in HCW immunization in increasingly constrained financial environments . These steps are fundamental to establish sustainability and cost-effectiveness of vaccination programs and underpin HCW immunization policy."

"SWhile many  women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS )  are overweight , obese or central ly obese , the effect of excess weight on the outcomes of PCOS is inconsistent . The review aim ed to assess the effects of  overweight , obesity and central obesity  on the reproductive , metabolic and psychological features of PCOS . MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL ,  Cochrane  Central  Register of Controlled Trials  ( CENTRAL ) and PSYCINFO were search ed for studies reporting outcomes according to body mass index categories or body fat distribution . Data were presented as mean difference or risk ratio ( 95 % confidence interval ) . This  review included 30 eligible studies .  Overweight or  obese women with PCOS  had  decreased sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) , increased total testosterone , free and rogen index , hirsutism , fasting glucose , fasting insulin , homeostatic model assessment -insulin resistance index and worsened lipid profile .  Obesity  significantly worsened  all  metabolic and reproductive outcomes  measured except for hirsutism when compared to normal weight women with PCOS . Overweight women had no differences in  total testosterone , hirsutism , total-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol  compared to normal weight women and no differences in  SHBG and total testosterone  compared to obese women .  Central  obesity was associated with  higher fasting insulin levels .  These results suggest that prevention and treatment of obesity is important for the management of PCOS."
"fPerson-centered  care ( PCC )  has been the subject of several intervention studies reporting positive effects on  people with  dementia .   However , its impact on staff remains unclear . The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the impact of  PCC approaches  on  stress , burnout , and job satisfaction  of  staff caring for people with dementia in residential aged care facilities .  Research articles published up to  2013  were search ed on PubMed , Web of Knowledge , Scopus , and EBSCO and reference lists from relevant publications . The review was limited to experimental and quasi-experimental studies , published in English and involving direct care workers ( DCWs ) . In all ,  7 studies were included  , addressing different  PCC approaches : dementia care mapping  ( n = 1 ) ,  stimulation-oriented approaches  ( n = 2 ) ,  emotion-oriented approaches  ( n = 2 ) , and  behavioral-oriented approaches  ( n = 2 ) . Method ological weaknesses and heterogeneity among studies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions . However , 5 studies reported  benefits on DCWs  , suggesting a tendency toward the effectiveness of  PCC  on staff."

"dThis systematic review aim ed to investigate whether intra-articular injections of  platelet-rich plasma ( PRP )  are beneficial for the treatment of  degenerative temporom and ibular disorders , such as temporom and ibular joint osteoarthritis ( TMJ-OA ) and disc displacement with osteoarthritic lesions  , when compared to other treatments , such as injections  of hyaluronic acid ( HA )  or  saline .  An electronic search of the MEDLINE and Scopus data bases was performed using combinations of the terms  "" temporom and ibular "" and "" platelet rich plasma ""  , to  identify studies reported in English and published up until May 2017 .  A h and - search of relevant journals and the reference lists of selected articles was also performed . The initial  screening identified 153 records , of which only six fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this review .  Of these studies , three compared  PRP  with  HA  , while three compared  PRP with Ringer 's lactate or saline .  Four of the studies found  PRP injections  to be superior in terms of  improvements in m and ibular range of motion and pain intensity  up to 12 months after treatment , while the remaining two studies found similar results for the different treatments . There is slight evidence for the potential benefits of intra-articular injections of  PRP  in  patients with TMJ-OA .  However , a st and ardized protocol for  PRP  preparation and application needs to be established."
 These results suggest that biologics have the potential to  improve HRQL   in UC patients .  High quality evidence suggests that infliximab provides a clinical ly meaningful  improvement in HRQL  in UC patients receiving induction therapy . Moderate quality evidence suggests that vedolizumab provides a clinical ly meaningful  improvement in HRQL  in UC patients receiving maintenance therapy . These findings are important since there is a paucity of effective drugs for the treatment of UC that have the potential to both  decrease disease activity and improve HRQL  . More research is needed to assess the long-term effect of biologic therapy on  HRQL  in  patients with UC .  More research is needed to assess the impact of golimumab and adalimumab on HRQL in UC patients . Trials involving direct head to head comparisons of biologics would help determine which biologics provide optimum benefit for HRQL.

We specifically selected clinical trials with a r and omized controlled or crossover design published in any scientific journal showing the following characteristics : 1 ) comparison of  different LABA/LAMA combinations  in a single inhaler for  patients with COPD  , 2 ) dose approved in Europe , and 3 ) focus on efficacy ( versus  placebo and /or bronchodilator monotherapy )  in terms of  lung function  ,  respiratory  symptoms , or exacerbations . RESULTS We analyzed  26 clinical trials conducted on 24,338 patients .  All  LABA/LAMA combinations  were consistently able to  improve lung function  compared with both  placebo and bronchodilator monotherapy .   Improvements in  symptoms were also consistent versus  placebo  , showing some lack of correlation for some clinical end points and combinations versus monotherapy bronchodilation . Albeit being an exploratory end point  , exacerbations  showed an improvement  with LABA/LAMA combinations over placebo  in some trials ; however , scarce information was available in comparison with bronchodilator monotherapy in most studies .  Our data show consistent improvements  for LABA/LAMA combinations  , albeit with some variability ( depending on the clinical end point , the specific combination , and the comparison group ) . Clinicians should be aware that these are average differences . All treatments should be tailored at the individual level to optimize clinical outcomes."
"3INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study is to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of  acupuncture  on  relieving  abdominal pain and distension  in acute pancreatitis .  METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will electronically search PubMed , MEDLINE , Embase , Web of Science , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , China Biomedical Literature Data base , China Science Journal Data base , and Wanfang Data base from their inception . Furthermore , we will manually retrieve other re sources , including reference lists of identified publications , conference articles , and gray literature . The clinical r and omized controlled trials or quasi-r and omized controlled trials related to  acupuncture  treating acute pancreatitis will be included in the study . The language is limited  to Chinese and English  . Research selection , data extraction , and research quality assessment will be independently completed by 2 research ers . Data will be synthesized using a fixed effects model or r and om effects model depending on the heterogeneity test .

"wOBJECTIVE To investigate the effects of  weaning protocol s  on the  total duration of mechanical ventilation , mortality , adverse events , quality of life , weaning duration , and length of stay  in the intensive care unit and hospital . DESIGN Systematic review . DATA SOURCES Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Medline , Embase , CINAHL , LILACS , ISI Web of Science , ISI Conference Proceedings , Cambridge Scientific Abstract s , and reference lists of articles . We did not apply language restrictions . Review methods We included r and omised and quasi-r and omised controlled trials of  weaning from mechanical ventilation with and without protocol s  in  critically ill adults .  Data selection Three authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data . A priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed . We contacted study authors for additional information . RESULTS  Eleven trials that included 1971 patients met the inclusion criteria .  Compared with usual care , the  geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation  in the weaning protocol group was reduced by 25 % ( 95 % confidence interval 9 % to 39 % , P=0.006 ; 10 trials ) ; the  duration of weaning  was reduced by 78 % ( 31 % to 93 % , P=0.009 ; six trials ) ; and  stay in the intensive care unit  length by 10 % ( 2 % to 19 % , P=0.02 ; eight trials ) . There was significant heterogeneity among studies for  total duration of mechanical ventilation  ( I(2)=76 % , P<0.01 ) and  duration of weaning  ( I(2)=97 % , P<0.01 ) , which could not be explained by subgroup analyses based on type of unit or type of approach .  There is evidence of a reduction in the  duration of mechanical ventilation , weaning , and stay in the intensive care unit  when st and ardised  weaning protocol  s are used , but there is significant heterogeneity among studies and an insufficient number of studies to investigate the source of this heterogeneity . Some studies suggest that organisational context could influence outcomes , but this could not be evaluated as it was outside the scope of this review."
" There is a wide heterogeneity in the selection and definition of outcomes in  paediatric appendicitis  , and little overlap in outcomes used across studies . A paucity of studies report patient relevant outcomes within the ‘ Life Impact ’ core area . These factors preclude meaningful evidence synthesis , and pose challenges to design ing prospect i ve clinical trials and cohort studies . The development of a COS for paediatric appendicitis is warranted."
">OBJECTIVES The current st and  ard  therapy for  locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( LASCCHN )  is  platinum-based chemotherapy plus concurrent radiotherapy ( CRT )  , but several systemic therapies have been evaluated . We performed a Bayesian network meta- analysis ( NMA ) with r and om effects to enable direct and indirect comparisons of all existing treatment modalities for LASCCHN simultaneously . MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE , EMBASE , ASCO abstract s , ASTRO abstract s and the Cochrane Central of Registered Trials using Cochrane methodology to identify r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) up to June 2016 . Only abstract s that involved the same definitive radiotherapy in the arms for the RCT were included . RESULTS  Sixty-five RCTs involving 13,574 patients and 16 different treatment strategies were identified .   Chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation ( CRT )  was superior to RT with a HR of 0.74 ( 95%CR 0.69 - 0.79 ) for OS in the NMA . Only 3 trials compared  RT  alone to  concurrent therapy with an EGFR  antibody   ( ERT ) , demonstrating a  superior OS  ( HR 0.75 , 95 % CR 0.60 - 0.94 ) , but this difference was not statistically significant when interpreted in a NMA ( HR 0.84 , 95%CR 0.65 - 1.08 ) . ERT was not superior to CRT ( HR 1.19 , 95%CR 0.93 - 1.54 ) , and the addition of neo-adjuvant  taxane-based chemotherapy  to CRT was not beneficial ( HR 0.86 , 95 % CR 0.70 - 1.07 ) .  The addition of either adjuvant or  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  to the CRT backbone does not confer an  OS benefit  in the treatment of LASCCHN . Similarly , ERT does not confer an  OS benefit  for  patients  who are  eligible for CRT ."
"nOBJECTIVE To synthesize the evidence for using  interactive digital interventions ( IDIs )  to support patient self-management of  hypertension  , and to determine their impact on control and reduction of  blood pressure .  METHOD Systematic review with meta- analysis was undertaken with a search performed in MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PsycINFO , ERIC , Cochrane Library , DoPHER , TROPHI , Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index .  The population was adults ( > 18 years ) with hypertension  , intervention was an  IDI  and the comparator was  usual care .  Primary outcomes were  change in SBP and DBP .  Only  r and omized controlled trials and studies  published in  journals and in English were eligible  . Eligible  IDIs  included  interventions accessed through a computer , smartphone or other h and -held device .  RESULTS Four out of seven studies showed a significantly greater reduction for intervention compared to usual care for  SBP  , with no difference found for three . Overall ,  IDIs  significantly  reduced SBP  , with the weighted mean difference being -3.74 mmHg [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -2.19 to -2.58 ] with no heterogeneity observed ( I-squared = 0.0 % , P = 0.990 ) . For  DBP  , four out of six studies indicated a greater reduction for intervention compared to controls , with no difference found for two . For  DBP  , a significant reduction of -2.37 mmHg ( 95 % CI -0.40 to -4.35 ) was found , but considerable heterogeneity was noted ( I-squared = 80.1 % , P = < 0.001 ) .   IDIs  lower both  SBP and DBP  compared to  usual care .  Results suggest these findings can be applied to a wide range of healthcare systems and population s. However , sustainability and long-term clinical effectiveness of these interventions remain uncertain."
"rContext Do  self-management programs  improve  outcomes  of  adults with chronic conditions  ? Contribution This meta- analysis summarizes data from  53 r and omized , controlled trials of  self-management interventions  for adults with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , or osteoarthritis .  Self-management helped reduce  hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure levels  in diabetes and hypertension , respectively , but had minimal effect on  pain and function  in  patients with arthritis .  The authors could not identify any  self-management program  characteristics that predicted successful outcomes . Caution s The authors found evidence of possible publication bias . Implication s  Self-management programs  may improve some outcomes in patients with some chronic diseases , but how to design an optimal program is not yet clear . The Editors Chronic diseases are conditions that are usually incurable . Although often not immediately life-threatening , they place substantial burdens on the health , economic status , and quality of life of individuals , families , and communities ( 1 ) . In 1995 , 79 % of  noninstitutionalized persons who were 70 years of age or older  reported having at least 1 of 7 of the most common chronic conditions affecting this age group : arthritis , hypertension , heart disease , diabetes mellitus , respiratory disease , stroke , and cancer ( 1 ) . Of these 7 conditions ,  arthritis  is most prevalent , affecting more than 47 % of individuals 65 years of age and older ( 2 ) .  Hypertension  affects 41 % of this population , and 31 % of this group has some form of heart disease ( of which ischemic heart disease and a history of myocardial infa rct ion are major components ) . Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 10 % of persons 65 years of age and older and increases the risk for other chronic conditions , including  ischemic heart disease , renal disease  , and  visual impairment  ( 2 ) . Enthusiasm is growing for the role of  self-management programs  in controlling and preventing  chronic disease complications  ( 3 - 5 ) . Despite this enthusiasm , experts do not agree on the definition of what constitutes a chronic disease  self-management  program , which elements of  self-management programs  are essential regardless of the clinical condition , or which elements are important for specific conditions . Several recent review s on chronic disease   self-management   interventions have been published , including 2 Cochrane collaborations ( 6 - 13 ) . Almost all have been disease-specific . One Cochrane review ( 12 ) concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assess the benefit of dietary  treatment  for type 2 diabetes mellitus programs , but exercise programs led to improved  hemoglobin A1c values .  A second Cochrane review of  self-management  for hypertension ( 11 ) used unpooled results to conclude that a reduction in the frequency of medication dosage increased adherence . There was not , however , consistent evidence of decreased  blood pressure .  Almost all previous review s have been disease-specific or addressed specific intervention components within specific disease conditions ( 14 - 17 ) . Two recent review s assessed  self-management programs  across conditions . The first review provided a qualitative evaluation of  self-management interventions  across 3 conditions : type 2 diabetes mellitus , arthritis , and asthma ( 18 ) . This review , which presented an overall optimistic assessment of self-management interventions , did not , however , include a quantitative synthesis of the data , nor did it address the issue of publication bias . The  second review quantitatively assessed 71 trials ( both r and omized and nonr and omized ) that included a  self-management education program  for patients with asthma , arthritis , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and miscellaneous other conditions .  Meta- analysis found statistically significant benefits for some outcomes within conditions . The authors could not detect meaningful differences in the  effectiveness  of the programs because of the varying intervention characteristics , such as the use of a formal syllabus , the type of program facilitator , the number of program sessions in which patients participated , and the duration of the program ( 19 ) . In our review , we sought to quantitatively assess  chronic disease  self-management   programs  for older adults within and across disease conditions .  We used empirical data from the literature to address 2 research questions : First , do chronic disease  self-management  programs result in improved  disease-related outcomes  for specific chronic diseases of high prevalence  in older adults  ? Second , if  self-management interventions  are effective , are there specific components that are most responsible for the effect , within or across disease conditions ? To address these questions , we focused on evaluating the  effect of  self-management programs   for the 3 chronic conditions that have been most commonly studied in  controlled trials of older adults :  osteoarthritis , diabetes mellitus , and hypertension . Methods Conceptual Model Because there is no accepted definition of what constitutes a chronic disease   self-management   program , we used an intentionally broad definition to avoid prematurely excluding relevant studies . On the basis of a conceptual framework derived from the clinical literature and from discussion s with social scientists with expertise in self-management , we defined chronic disease self-management as a systematic intervention that is targeted toward patients  with chronic disease  . The intervention should help them actively participate in either or both of the following : self-monitoring ( of symptoms or of physiologic processes ) or decision making ( managing the disease or its impact through self-monitoring ) . We attempted to underst and the characteristics particular to chronic disease self-management  programs  that may be most responsible for their effectiveness . On the basis of the literature and expert opinion , we postulated 5 hypotheses regarding the effectiveness of   chronic disease self-management  programs  that feature the following characteristics : Tailoring .  Patients  who receive  interventions  tailored to their specific needs and circumstances are likely to derive more benefit than those receiving interventions that are generic . roup setting . Patients are more likely to benefit from  interventions  received within a group setting that includes others affected by the same condition than from an  intervention  provided in some other setting . Feedback . Patients are more likely to derive benefit from a cycle of intervention followed by some form of individual review with the provider of the intervention than from interventions where no such review exists . Psychological emphasis . Patients are more likely to derive benefit from a  psychological intervention  than from interventions where there is no psychological emphasis . Medical care .  Patients who receive  interventions  directly from their medical providers ( physicians or primary care providers )  are more likely to derive benefit than those  who receive interventions  from nonmedical providers . Outcome Measures From the literature , we identified outcomes of interest to include the following :  clinical outcomes , such  as  pain and function for osteoarthritis ; measures  that have strong links to clinical outcomes , such as  hemoglobin A1c levels , fasting blood glucose levels , and patient weight for diabetes and blood pressure for hypertension ;  and  intermediate outcomes  , such as  knowledge , feeling of self-efficacy , and health behaviors  that are postulated to be related to clinical outcomes . Data bases for Literature Search We used several data bases and published documents to identify existing research and potentially relevant evidence for this report . For our primary source of citation information from 1980 until 1995 , we used An Indexed Bibliography on  Self-Management  for  People with Chronic Disease  ( 20 ) , published by the Center for Advancement of Health in association with the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound ; we obtained any studies not listed in the bibliography ( including those published later than 1995 ) by search ing MEDLINE , PsycINFO , and CINAHL . We also used the Cochrane Library ( its data base of systematic review s and the central register of controlled trials ) ; the Assessment of Self-Care Manuals , published by the Evidence -based Practice Center at the Oregon Health Sciences University ( 21 ) ; and 77 other previously completed review s relevant to this project . We retrieved all relevant documents referenced in these publications , and we up date d our search in September 2004 . Each review discussed at least 1 intervention aim ed at chronic disease self-management . We also search ed the Health Care Quality Improvement Projects data base , maintained by the U.S. Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services .  This data base contains reports known as narrative project documents , each of which describes an individual research project conducted by a Medicare Peer Review Organization ; most projects in this data base are not published elsewhere . Each report includes the project 's background , aims , quality indicators , collaborators , sampling methods , interventions , measurement , and results . A complete description of our literature search has been reported elsewhere ( 22 ) . Article Selection and Data Abstract ion  Two trained physician review ers  , working independently , conducted the article selection , quality assessment , and data abstract ion ; disagreements were resolved by consensus or third-party adjudication . Articles were not masked . We included all r and omized trials that assessed the effects of an intervention or interventions relative to either a group  that received usual care or a control group  among  the elderly  and for  our 3 conditions  . Most studies compared their intervention with  usual care  or with  a control intervention design ed  to account for the added attention received in the intervention ( such as attending classes on  vehicle safety  instead of attending classes on   self-management )   . Because our analysis was funded by the Centers for."
" An  exercise  dose associated with reductions in  weight gain  was unquantifiable among these interventions . Adherence and retention rates were strong contributors to the success of  exercise interventions  on  gestational weight gain .  It is strongly suggested that future research ers investigate methods to increase adherence and compliance , especially among overweight and obese women , and utilize objective measurement tools to accurately evaluate exercise dose performed by the participants and the impact on body composition and weight gain."
"wPurpose The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the current literature in an effort to assess specific clinical outcomes following  meniscal scaffold implantation  using the two available scaffolds :  Collagen Meniscal Implant ( CMI ) and the Actifit polyurethane meniscal scaffold .  Methods A systematic review was performed by search ing PubMed , Embase , and Cochrane Library to find studies evaluating clinical outcomes of  patients undergoing  meniscal scaffold implantation .   Search terms used were “ meniscus ” , “ meniscal ” , “ scaffold  ”  , and “ implant  ”  . Studies were evaluated based on  scaffold type , treatment failure rates , patient-reported outcome scores , concomitant procedures  , and  radiological findings . Radiological findings  were recorded using the Genovese scale to assess morphology and signal intensity and the Yulish score to assess articular cartilage . Results Nineteen studies ( 1 level I , 1 level II , 17 level IV evidence ) were identified that met inclusion criteria ,  including a total of 658 patients ( 347 Actifit , 311 CMI ) .  The overall average follow-up was 45 months .  Treatment failure  occurred in 9.9 % of patients receiving the  Actifit scaffold  at a mean follow-up of 40 months and 6.7 % of patients receiving  CMI  at a mean follow-up of 44 months ( n.s . ) . However , the  rate of failure  ranged from 0 to 31.8 % amongst the included studies with a variable definition of failure . Additionally , overlapping patients and presence of concomitant surgeries such as anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR ) and high tibial osteotomy ( HTO ) may have a significant influence on these results . Outcomes for the  Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) for pain , Lysholm knee score , and Tegner activity score  improved from preoperatively to latest follow-up in both groups , while the  Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and International Knee Documentation Committee scores  improved from preoperatively to latest follow-up for Actifit scaffold patients . Overall , patients  receiving CMI scaffolds  had higher grade s for  Genovese morphology  and signal intensity when compared to  Actifit  scaffold patients . Conclusion  Patients undergoing meniscal scaffold implantation with  either CMI or Actifit scaffold   can both be expected to experience improvement in clinical outcomes when used in association with concomitant procedures such as ACLR and HTO.Level of evidence IV , systematic review."
"dIntroduction .  Patients with head and neck cancer  suffer from various impairments due to the primary illness , as well as secondary consequences of the oncological treatment . This systematic review describes the effects of  radiotherapy and /or chemotherapy  on the functions of the upper aerodigestive tract in  patients with head and neck cancer .  Methods . A systematic literature search was performed by two independent review ers using the electronic data bases PubMed and Embase . All date s up to May 2016 were included . Results . Of the  947 abstract s , sixty articles met  the inclusion criteria and described one or more aspects of the sequelae of  radiotherapy and /or chemotherapy .  Forty studies described  swallowing-related problems  , 24 described  voice-related problems  , seven described  trismus  , and 25 studies described  general quality of life .  Only 14 articles reported that speech pathologists conducted the interventions , of which only six articles described in detail what the interventions involved . Conclusion . In general ,  voice quality  improved following intervention , whereas  quality of life , dysphagia , and oral intake  deteriorated during and after treatment . However , as a consequence of the diversity in treatment protocol s and patient characteristics , the conclusions of most studies can not be easily generalised . Further research on the effects of  oncological interventions  on the upper aerodigestive tract is needed."
"sIntroduction  Massage  is a popular adjunct to  cancer  palliation . This systematic review is aim ed at critically evaluating all available r and omised clinical trials of  massage  in cancer palliation . Material s and methods  Six data bases were  search ed to identify all trials of  classical massage   for cancer patients .  Studies of other types of  massage  , e.g. reflexology , aromatherapy , were excluded .  Fourteen trials met all inclusion criteria .  Discussion Collectively , they suggest that  massage  can alleviate a  wide  range  of symptoms : pain , nausea , anxiety , depression , anger , stress and fatigue .  However , the method ological quality of the included studies was poor , a fact that prevents definitive conclusions . Conclusion The evidence is , therefore , encouraging but not compelling . The subject seems to warrant further investigations which avoid the limitations of previous studies."

"0AIM OF THE STUDY Reconstruction of  segmental defects and the atrophic maxilla and m and ible  is performed using various techniques .  Bone substitutes  have received a wealth of reports in the literature demonstrating a long-term success when used in  alveolar bone augmentation  procedures . MATERIAL S AND METHODS We review ed articles comparing TiMesh GBR technique with different  percentage of bone : autogenous bone alone ( AB ) ; anorganic bovine bone alone ( ABB ) ; 50:50 or 70:30  . From an initial pool of 122 ,  we selected 14 studies .  ANOVA followed by Tukey  HSD  test was used for statistical analysis . RESULTS We present a table analysing fundamental parameters to value a successful  GBR therapy .   Autogenous bone  remains the gold st and ard in GBR technique with TiMesh ; however , the combination between AB/ABB in relation 50:50 and 70:30 allows reducing  surgical cost  exploiting properties of eterologous bone .  The use of  autologous bone  is associated with a  height and width gain of bone  , which are greater compared to other techniques , with a lower exposure of the mesh and a lower bone resorption . The use of  heterologous graft  leads to a lower  bone earn  and to percentage of  resorption  greater than autologous graft but does not differ from the gain  and resorption  of the bone of AB/ABB in percentage 50:50 and 70:30."

"eBACKGROUND  Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs ( bDMARDs )  extend the treatment choices for  rheumatoid arthritis patients with suboptimal response or intolerance to conventional DMARDs .  The objective of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to compare the relative efficacy of EU-licensed  bDMARD combination therapy  or  monotherapy  for  patients intolerant of or contraindicated to continued methotrexate .  METHODS Comprehensive , structured literature search es were conducted in Medline , Embase , and the Cochrane Library , as well as h and - search ing of conference proceedings and reference lists . Phase II or III r and omized controlled trials reporting American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) criteria scores of 20 , 50 , and 70 between  12 and  30 weeks ' follow-up and  enrolling adult patients meeting ACR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis previously treated with and with an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs were eligible .  To estimate the relative efficacy of treatments whilst preserving the r and omized comparisons within each trial , a Bayesian network meta- analysis was conducted in WinBUGS using fixed and r and om-effects , logit-link models fitted to the binomial ACR 20/50/70 trial data . RESULTS The systematic review identified  10,625 citations  , and after a review of 2450 full-text papers , there were 29  and 14 eligible studies  for the combination and monotherapy meta-analyses , respectively . In the combination analysis , all licensed bDMARD combinations had significantly  higher odds of ACR 20/50/70  compared to DMARDs alone , except for the rituximab comparison , which did not reach significance for  the ACR 70 outcome  ( based on the 95 % credible interval ) .  The etanercept  combination was  significantly better than the tumor necrosis  factor-α  inhibitors  adalimumab and infliximab  in improving ACR 20/50/70 outcomes  , with no significant differences between  the  etanercept combination and certolizumab pegol or tocilizumab  . Licensed-dose etanercept , adalimumab , and tocilizumab monotherapy  were  significantly better  than placebo  in improving ACR 20/50/70 outcomes .  Sensitivity analysis indicated that including studies outside the target population could affect the results .  Licensed bDMARDs are efficacious in patients with an inadequate response to conventional therapy , but tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor combination therapies are not equally effective."
" There is evidence that  physiotherapy intervention  , using a mix of components from different approaches , is significantly more effective than no treatment or placebo control in the recovery of  functional independence  following stroke . There is insufficient evidence to conclude that any one  physiotherapy  approach is more effective in promoting  recovery of lower limb function or postural control  following stroke than any other approach . We recommend that future research should concentrate on investigating the effectiveness of clearly described individual techniques and task-specific treatments , regardless of their historical or philsophical origin."
 Two trials are included in this review but no conclusions can be drawn for the benefit of  co-acupressure  for slowing  progress of  myopia  in children .  Further evidence in the form of RCTs are needed before any recommendations can be made for the use of  acupuncture  treatment in clinical use . These trials should compare  acupuncture  to  placebo  and have large sample sizes . Other types of  acupuncture  ( such as  auricular acupuncture )  should be explored further as well as compliance with treatment for at least six months or longer .  Axial length elongation of the eye  should be investigated for at least one year . The potential to reduce/eliminate pain from  acupuncture  experienced by  children  should also be review ed.
"dWith the current wealth of new inhalers available and insurance policy driven inhaler switching , the need for insights in optimal education on inhaler use is more evident than ever . We aim ed to systematic ally review  educational inhalation technique interventions  , to assess their overall effectiveness , and identify main drivers of success . Medline , Embase and CINAHL data bases were search ed for r and omised controlled trials on   educational  inhalation  technique  interventions .  Inclusion eligibility , quality appraisal ( Cochrane ’s risk of bias tool ) and data extraction were performed by two independent review ers . Regression analyses were performed to identify characteristics contributing to inhaler technique improvement . Thirty-seven of the  39 interventions  included ( 95 % ) indicated statistically significant improvement of inhaler  technique .  However ,  average follow-up time  was relatively short ( 5 months ) , 28 % lacked clinical relevant endpoints and all lacked cost-effectiveness estimates .  Poor initial technique , number of inhalation procedure steps , setting  ( outpatient clinics performing best ) , and  time elapsed since intervention  ( all , p < 0.05 ) , were shown to have an impact on effectiveness of the intervention , explaining up to 91 % of the effectiveness variation . Other factors , such as  disease ( asthma vs. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease )  , education group size ( individual vs. group training ) and inhaler type ( dry powder inhalers vs. pressurised metered dose inhalers ) did not play a significant role . Notably , there was a trend ( p = 0.06 ) towards interventions in adults being  more effective  than those in children and the intervention  effect  seemed to wane over time . In conclusion  , educational interventions  to improve  inhaler technique  are  effective  on the short-term . Periodical intervention reinforcement and longer follow-up studies , including clinical relevant  endpoints  and  cost-effectiveness  , are recommended."
"sIndividuals managing the challenges of  life-limiting illness  require adequate social support to maintain quality of life . Qualitative research reports that patients value highly the social support obtained in  palliative care interventions  such as  day care and group therapies .  This systematic review aims to summarise existing quantitative evidence on  palliative care interventions  that facilitate social support . Research literature was systematic ally search ed using electronic data bases and key journals . Search es returned a total of  6,247 unique titles of which sixteen were eligible for inclusion .  Interventions include  group therapies , group practical interventions and palliative day care .  Outcome measures and study design s were heterogeneous . Only one study used a vali date d outcome  measure of social support  . Benefits were influenced by participant characteristics such as baseline distress .  Partial economic evaluation  was attempted by two studies . Method ological challenges include attrition and use of outcome measures that were insensitive to change . Statistically significant results were reported in  psychological and physical domains .  Evidence is limited due to method ological issues and a scarcity of quantitative research , particularly regarding  long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness .  Interventions may be more beneficial to some groups than others."
 : We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the use of  acupuncture  for relief of PD symptoms and found that  acupuncture  has significant positive  effects .   Acupuncture  can be considered as a combination  treatment with conventional treatment  for  patients with PD .  Further studies on this topic should be carried out according to rigorous method ological design s in both the East and the West.
" The prevalence and intensity of  anxiety  has been shown to be pronounced among the three treatments .  Chemotherapy  , as compared to other treatments , has shown to be associated with a higher  anxiety level .  IMPLICATION S FOR RESEARCH With the prevalence , intensity and correlated factors of anxiety identified through this review , future research may investigate the interventions that could help alleviate anxiety among these patients . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE  Anxiety  is prevalent in  women with breast cancer undergoing treatment  ,  especially those undergoing  chemotherapy .   Healthcare professionals should pay greater attention to identify cues of anxiety in patients and prevent/alleviate it."
" : We found no objective evidence of a ' weanling 's dilemma ' .  Infants  who are exclusively  breastfed  for six months experience less  morbidity from gastrointestinal infection  than those who are mixed breastfed as of three or four months , and no deficits have been demonstrated in growth among infants from either developing or developed countries who are exclusively breastfed for six months or longer . Moreover , the mothers of such infants have more prolonged  lactational amenorrhea .  Although infants should still be managed individually so that insufficient growth or other adverse outcomes are not ignored and appropriate interventions are provided , the available evidence demonstrates no apparent risks in recommending , as a general policy ,  exclusive breastfeeding  for the first six months of life in both developing and developed country setting s. Large r and omized trials are recommended in both types of setting to rule out small effects on growth and to confirm the reported health benefits of  exclusive breastfeeding  for six months or beyond."
" There is low to moderate-level evidence that compared with no treatment and st and ard therapy ,  acupuncture  improves  pain and stiffness  in  people with fibromyalgia .  There is moderate-level evidence that the effect of  acupuncture  does not differ from  sham acupuncture  in  reducing pain or fatigue , or improving sleep or global well-being .  EA is probably better than MA for  pain and stiffness reduction and improvement of global well-being , sleep and fatigue .  The effect lasts up to one month , but is not maintained at six months follow-up . MA probably does not  improve pain or physical functioning .   Acupuncture  appears  safe .   People with fibromyalgia  may consider using EA alone or with exercise and medication . The small sample size , scarcity of studies for each comparison , lack of an ideal sham  acupuncture  weaken the level of evidence and its clinical implication s. Larger studies are warranted."

"yThe aim of this study was to evaluate the structural effect of  denosumab  on  patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .  We performed a systematic review of the literature in the following data bases : PubMed , Cochrane , Web of Science , Clinical Trials.gov , and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform . All studies evaluating the structural effect of   denosumab  on RA  and meeting predefined criteria were included .  Data regarding disease activity , progression of joint damage , joint space narrowing , and safety  were recorded .  Among 168 studies identified , only 4 were finally included in this review , involving a total of 687 patients .  These 4 studies showed that  denosumab  is effective on  joint damage  at 6 and 12 months as compared to  placebo , alendronate , and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (  bDMARDs ) alone .  No  effect was observed in terms of  joint space narrowing , and DAS28 and HAQ scores  remained unchanged . No case of  osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical fracture  was recorded , and  safety  was similar in both denosumab and control groups .  Denosumab  appears to be effective on  joint erosion  at 6 and 12 months in  patients with RA meeting the ACR criteria  , treated or not by a biologic , with excellent safety."
"FCancer-related  fatigue ( CRF )  is a common symptom among  patients with cancer .  The efficacy of  placebo  , however , was never the main objective of any meta- analysis . Predicting the efficacy of  placebo  may facilitate research ers in design ing future clinical trials for the treatment of CRF . We performed a systematic review search ing for prospect i ve clinical trials comparing any treatment versus  placebo  for the treatment of CRF . We  included studies that enrolled patients with any primary site of neoplasia and any stage of cancer .  We  excluded all studies that assessed fatigue related to any treatment  . The primary endpoint of this study is the mean  effect  of   placebo  on fatigue according to the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness ( FACIT-F ) and Brief Fatigue Inventory ( BFI ) scales .  The secondary endpoint was the  proportion of patients who reported improvement in fatigue  ( response rate ) .  We  found  520 studies , and 29 studies with 3758 participants were included in the meta- analysis .   Placebo  had a mean effect of + 4.88 ( 95%CI + 2.45 to + 7.29 ) using the  FACIT-F scale  , although it was statistically worse than the interventions studied ( p = 0.005 ) . Using  the BFI scale  ,  placebo  had an average effect of + 0.64 ( 95%CI + 0.02 to + 1.30 ) , although it was also worse than the other interventions studied ( p = 0.002 ) . In terms of the response rate , 29 % ( 95%CI 25–32 % ) of patients taking a  placebo  reported a  significant improvement in CRF  compared with 36 % of patients treated with other interventions ( p = 0.030 ) .  Placebo  treatments had a significant effect  on CRF  , and predicting these effects may help design future studies for CRF."
"tAmong  acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) patients in intensive care units  , the efficacy of  lung recruitment maneuver ( LRM )  use is uncertain taking into account the most recent r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . We aim ed to estimate the effect of  LRMs  on mortality from ARDS . In this systematic review and meta- analysis , we search ed for RCTs comparing  mechanical ventilation with and without LRMs  in  adults with ARDS .  We generated pooled relative risks ( RR ) , mean difference , performed trial-sequential- analysis and cumulative meta- analysis . The primary outcome was  28-day mortality .  The secondary outcomes were  oxygenation evaluated by PaO2/FiO2 ratio , rate of rescue therapy and rate of hemodynamic compromise .   In 14 RCTs including 3185 patients  , LRMs were not associated with  reduced 28-day mortality  ( RR = 0.92 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 0.82–1.04 , P = 0.21 ) , compared to no-LRM . Trial-sequential- analysis showed that the required information size has been accrued .  PaO2/FiO2 ratio  was significantly higher in the  LRMs  group in comparison to the  no-LRM  group ( mean difference = 47.6 mmHg , 95 % CI 33.4–61.8 , P < 0.001 ) . LRMs were associated with a  decreased rate of rescue therapy  ( RR = 0.69 95 % CI 0.56–0.84 , P < 0.001 ) , and an  increased rate of hemodynamic compromise  ( RR = 1.19 , 95 % CI 1.06–1.33 , P = 0.002 ) , compared to no-LRM group . Using cumulative meta- analysis , a significant change for effect  on mortality  was observed after 2017 . The results suggest that in  ARDS  patients , systematic use of  LRMs  does not significantly  improve 28-day mortality .  However ,  LRM  use was associated with positive effects such as  an oxygenation improvement and a less frequent use of rescue therapy .  Nevertheless ,  LRM  use was associated with negative effects such as hemodynamic impairment."
"sINTRODUCTION The widespread use of  prostate cancer screening  has led to a stage migration result ing in an increase in the diagnosis of  low-risk disease  , which currently accounts for 40 - 50 % of diagnosed forms . New therapeutic strategies have been developed in order to minimize the  risk of overtreatment .  METHODS A systematic review of the literature over the past 20 years was performed using the Medline data base . The literature selection was based on evidence and practical considerations . RESULTS Low-risk tumors are conventionally defined by the d'Amico classification . The use of  multiparametric MRI  helps to better characterize these tumors . The contribution of molecular biology remains to be determined in clinical practice . Novel therapeutic options for low-risk disease are currently being evaluated .  The new therapeutic strategies are evolving . They seek to reduce  overtreatment  without compromising oncological success."

" The review study demonstrated that  cancer survivors  are relatively inactive , but physical activity may help to reduce the  risk of cancer recurrence and cancer-related mortality  , increase  cancer treatment rates  , reduce  pain and other side effects associated  with cancer treatment , and improve  physical and mental health .  The epidemiologic study showed that  physical activity  was associated with several understudied biomarkers ( e.g. ,  neutrophils , white blood cells )  that are linked with cancer recurrence , cancer-related mortality , and other chronic diseases . IMPLICATION S FOR NURSING Nurses are encouraged to promote  physical activity  in cancer survivors."
"sREVIEW OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesis e the best available evidence to examine whether periodontal disease is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis . BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology and has a complex multifactorial pathogenesis affecting joints and other tissues . The natural history of rheumatoid arthritis is poorly defined ; its clinical course fluctuates and the prognosis unpredictable . Rheumatoid arthritis affects up to 1 - 3 % of the population , with a 3:1 female preponderance disappearing in older age . There is also evidence of a genetic predisposition to the disease . Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by progressive and irreversible damage of the synovial-lined joints causing loss of joint space , bone and function , leading to deformity . Extracellular matrix degradation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis which is responsible for the typical destruction of cartilage , ligaments , tendons , and bone . Rheumatoid arthritis is characteristically a symmetric arthritis ( symmetrical swelling of the joints ) . Articular and periarticular manifestations include  joint swelling and tenderness to palpation  , with  morning stiffness  and  severe motion impairment  in the involved joints . Extra-articular signs can involve pulmonary , cardiovascular , nervous , and reticuloendothelial systems . The clinical presentation of rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis varies , but an insidious onset of pain with  symmetric swelling of the small joints  is the most frequent finding . Rheumatoid arthritis onset is acute or subacute in about 25 % of patients . Early rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by  symmetric polyarthritis  involving the small joints of the h and s and feet with no  radiologic changes  . Rheumatoid arthritis most frequently affects the metacarpophalangeal , proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints . Although any joint , including the cricoarytenoid joint , can be affected , the distal interphalangeal , the sacroiliac and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved , which is peculiar because these are some of the most typical targets of seronegative spondylarthropathies , such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis . The clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis vary , depending on the involved joints and the disease stage . The  clinical features of synovitis  are particularly apparent in the morning .  Morning stiffness in and around the joints  , lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement is a typical sign of rheumatoid arthritis . It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between  pain and stiffness . Morning stiffness duration  is related to disease activity . Progression of rheumatoid arthritis can be measured by laboratory tests and  clinical evaluation  ( question naires of disease activity and physical examination ) . Laboratory tests include blood tests for Rheumatoid factor ( RF ) and Acute-phase reaction tests while clinical evaluation can be measured by the Disease activity using the  Disease Activity Score ( DAS ) .  Periodontitis is a destructive inflammatory disease of the dental supporting tissues which leads to erosion of bone around teeth result ing in tooth loss . Severe  periodontitis  affects about 5 - 15 % of the  adult population .  In periodontitis , the clinical findings of bone resorption and loss of  clinical  attachment level around tooth are a result of inflammatory mediated alterations to the bone remodelling balance . The inflammatory infiltrate present between the plaque biofilm , bone and connective tissues regulate the host immune response to the bacteria . The host produces proteases and substances that de grade the extracellular matrix , and lead to resorption of the alveolar bone , result ing in irreversible loss of tissue attachment . Bone is a dynamic tissue and bone homeostasis involves the opposing events of resorption and apposition ; dissolution of the existing bone mineral , resorption of the extracellular matrix , and formation of a new matrix . Bone homeostasis mechanisms maintain  bone integrity  in the alveolar bone ( regulates periodontal bone loss ) and , elsewhere in the body . It also functions to regulate the  calcium balance  within the body ; this is an important ion as it is involved in the clotting of blood , formation of gl and ular secretions and regulation of the cardiac pacemaker . Rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis are arguably the most prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases in humans and associated with significant morbidities . rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis share similar clinical and pathogenic characteristics . Both rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis present an  imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines  , which is thought to be responsible for the tissue damage . In this sense , both conditions are associated with  destruction of bone  , mediated by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 ,  tumour necrosis factor  and  prostagl  and in  E2.Several  studies have suggested a relationship between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis ; rheumatoid arthritis may have a negative impact on periodontal condition and vice versa . Mercado et al. in 2001 reported a significantly high prevalence of  moderate to severe periodontitis  in  individuals with rheumatoid arthritis .  In addition , the converse is true :  periodontitis patients  have a higher prevalence of  rheumatoid arthritis  compared to the general population . One study found that induction of experimental arthritis  in rats  result ed in  periodontal destruction  and  increased cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases  in the periodontal tissues . Oral bacterial DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acids ) is detected in serum and synovial fluid of  patients with rheumatoid arthritis .  Patients with rheumatoid arthritis also have a significantly higher level of  immunoglobulin G antibody  against P. gingivalis , Prevotella  intermedia  , and  Tannerella forsythia .  Furthermore , two recent clinical trials suggested that the treatment of periodontal disease might have a significant impact on  rheumatoid arthritis  severity . Similarly ,  subjects with rheumatoid arthritis  have significantly increased  periodontal attachment loss .  In a recent research article , Ogrendik et al. in 2009 concluded that antibodies formed against these oral bacteria could be important to the aetiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis . They recommended that gingival tissue infections should be considered in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis and that periodontal infections should be treated and prevented from becoming chronic . If successful results are observed against periodontal infections in clinical , radiologic , and laboratory data of the  rheumatoid arthritis patients  , the essential role of these bacteria in the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis can be proven . One hypothesis that links rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis is the recently published "" two-hit "" model that attempts to link experimental evidence from animal models and is supported by evidence from human clinical studies . In this theory , the first "" hit "" involves the periodontopathic subgingival biofilm and its microbial products , such as endotoxin . The second "" hit "" involves a medical systemic disease , such as rheumatoid arthritis , which increases biomarkers  of systemic inflammation  in the circulation , including  C reactive protein ( CRP )  ,  cytokines  ( e.g.  IL-6 )  ,  prostanoids  ( e.g.  PGE2  ) , and  matrix metalloproteinases  ( e.g.  MMP-9 )  , and  tumour necrosis factor alpha  (  TNF- α )  . These cytokines are thought to stimulate resident cells in the synovium and the periodontium to produce MMPs mediating connective tissue destruction , and induce the  differentiation and activity of  osteoclasts to destroy bone In particular , TNF-α , also promotes bone resorption : ( i ) by up-regulating inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) and the production of nitric oxide ( NO ) ; and ( ii ) by modulating the receptor activator of nuclear factor _ B ( NF_B ) lig and ( RANKL ) in osteoblasts , and its antagonist osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) , thus altering  the RANKL/OPG ratio  , which  enhances osteoclast activity  , and finally , lead  to periodontal breakdown .  Most recently Bartold et al , reported a series of experiments to examine the plausibility of the "" two hit "" theory investigated whether the  onset and severity of experimental arthritis   in  a  rodent model  was influenced by the presence of a pre-existing extra-synovial chronic inflammatory reaction to P. gingivalis . They discovered that  severe arthritis  developed more rapidly in  animals  with a  pre-existing P. gingivalis   induced inflammatory lesion  , thus providing further evidence for a relationship between the presence of periodontal pathogen-associated inflammation and the development  of  rheumatoid arthritis .   Aggressive periodontitis is rapid progression of periodontal disease with severe periodontal breakdown . The amount and pattern of periodontal destruction is very aggressive indicating there may be other characteristics in addition that contribute to its rate of destruction , and hence is outside of the scope of this review .Before undertaking this review , the JBI Library of Systematic Review s , Cochrane Library of Systematic Review s , Medline and CINAHL were search ed . As no systematic review has been identified as been either published or underway on this topic , the aim of this systematic review is to identify and synthesis e the best available evidence of periodontal disease as a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis."
"hCONTEXT As the food industry is continually involved in the development of new attractive alternative therapeutic agents , the evaluation of the beneficial impact of  (poly)phenols  on  cognitive and brain function  during aging has gained increasing interest . OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to evaluate the acute and chronic effects of  (poly)phenol-rich diet supplementation  on   cognitive function and brain health  in aging adults .  DATA SOURCES PubMed and Web of Science data bases were search ed for relevant r and omized  placebo-controlled  trials ( RCTs ) published from inception to July 2019 . STUDY SELECTION  Two research ers independently screened 4303 records , using the PICOS criteria : Participants were aging adults ;  Intervention was based on acute and /or  chronic (poly)phenols-rich supplementation ;  Comparator was any comparator ; Outcomes included cognitive function and neuroprotective measures ; and Study design was RCTs . A third research er was consulted when discrepancies arose .  Fifteen high- quality ( mean PEDro score = 8.8 ± 0.56 ) RCTs ( total participants : 918 healthy older adults ) were included  in the  final sample  . DATA EXTRACTION Information on study design , employed treatment , characteristics of participants , outcomes , and the correspondent assessing methods were extracted . Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines were followed . Data Analysis and Results : A r and om-effects meta- analysis was used to pool estimates across studies  . Effect size ( ES )  and its  95 % confidence interval ( CI )  was calculated . Pooled results yielded a trivial ES ( -0.2 to 0.03  ) for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neuroinflammatory parameters  and small ( 0.36 ) to moderate ( 0.82 ) ES  for executive functions  .  This meta- analysis failed to provide evidence regarding  the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect   of (poly)phenols supplementation  in  aging  adults . However , findings from individual studies , included in this systematic review , suggest polyphenol-rich supplementation may  improve some cognitive and brain functions  in  older  adults . The beneficial effect of polyphenols seems to depend on ingested dose and bioavailability . Results suggest at least an intermediate dose ( ≥500 mg ) , and intermediate ( ≈9 % ) to high ( 43 % ) bioavailability rates are needed to cross the brain blood barrier and to exert a significant effect  on  cognitive health."

"sCurrent underst and ing of biologic processes indicates that  women 's  nutritional status before and during  early  pregnancy may play an important role in determining early developmental processes and ensuring successful pregnancy outcomes . We conducted a systematic review of the evidence for the impact of  maternal  nutrition  before and during early pregnancy ( < 12 weeks gestation ) on maternal , neonatal and child health outcomes  and included  45 articles ( nine intervention trials and 32 observational studies ) that were identified through PubMed and EMBASE data base search es and examining review articles .  Intervention trials and observational studies show that  periconceptional  ( < 12 weeks gestation )  folic acid supplementation  significantly reduced the  risk of neural tube defects .  Observational studies suggest that preconceptional and periconceptional intake of  vitamin and mineral supplements  is associated with a reduced risk of delivering offspring who are   low birthweight and  /or  small-for-gestational  age ( SGA ) and preterm deliveries ( PTD ) .  Some studies report that indicators of maternal prepregnancy size , low stature , underweight and overweight are associated with increased  risks of PTD and SGA .  The available data indicate the importance of women 's nutrition prior to and during the first trimester of pregnancy , but there is a need for well- design ed prospect i ve studies and controlled trials in developing country setting s that examine relationships with  low birthweight , SGA , PTD , stillbirth and maternal and neonatal mortality .  The knowledge gaps that need to be addressed include the evaluation of  periconceptional interventions  such as  food supplements , multivitamin-mineral supplements and /or specific micronutrients ( iron , zinc , iodine , vitamin B-6 and B-12 )  as well as the relationship between measures of prepregnancy  body  size and  composition  and maternal , neonatal and child health outcomes."
"eBackground .  H and writing difficulties  are among the most common reasons for referral of  children to occupational therapy .  Purpose . To determine the effectiveness of   h and writing  interventions .  Methods . A systematic review was carried out . Included studies were r and omized or nonr and omized controlled trials of interventions that could be used by an occupational therapist to improve  written output ( printing or writing )  among  school-aged children identified as having difficulties with h and writing .  Electronic search es of relevant data bases were conducted up to January 2010 . Findings .  Eleven studies  met the inclusion criteria . These studies tested ( 1 )  relaxation and practice with or without EMG , ( 2 ) sensory-based training without h and writing practice  , and  ( 3 ) h and writing-based practice ( including sensory-focused or cognitive focused h and writing practice )  . Regardless of treatment type , interventions that did not include  h and writing practice  and those that included less than 20 practice sessions were  ineffective  . Implication s. Effective occupational therapy for improving  h and writing  must include adequate h and writing practice."

"  Fortification of foods with zinc  may improve  the serum zinc status  of population s if zinc is the only micronutrient used for fortification . If zinc is added to food in combination with other micronutrients , it may make little or no difference to the  serum zinc status .  Effects of fortification of foods with zinc on other  outcomes including zinc deficiency , children 's growth , cognition , work capacity of adults , or on haematological indicators  are unknown . Given the small number of trials and participants in each trial , further investigation of these outcomes is required."
"mSedatives are commonly used for  mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units ( ICU ) .  However , a variety of sedatives are available and their  efficacy and safety  have been compared in numerous trials with inconsistent results . To resolve uncertainties regarding usefulness of these sedatives , we performed a systematic review and network meta- analysis .  R and omized  controlled trials comparing sedatives  in mechanically ventilated ICU patients  were included . Graph-theoretical methods were employed for network meta- analysis .  A total of 51 citations comprising 52 RCTs were included  in our  analysis  .  Dexmedetomidine  showed  shorter MV duration  than  lorazepam  ( mean difference ( MD ) : 68.7 ; 95 % CI : 18.2 - 119.3 hours ) ,  midazolam  ( MD : 10.2 ; 95 % CI : 7.7 - 12.7 hours ) and  propofol  ( MD : 3.4 ; 95 % CI : 0.9 - 5.9 hours ) . Compared with  dexmedetomidine ,  midazolam was associated with significantly  increased risk of delirium  ( OR : 2.47 ; 95 % CI : 1.17 - 5.19 ) . Our study shows that  dexmedetomidine  has potential benefits in reducing duration of MV and lowering the risk of delirium."

"sWe conducted a meta- analysis to evaluate the effects of  probiotics and prebiotics  on the  immune  response  to  influenza vaccination  in adults .  We conducted a literature search of Pubmed , Embase , the Cochrane Library , the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health ( CINAHL ) , Airiti Library , and PerioPath Index to  Taiwan Periodical  Literature  in Taiwan .  Data bases were search ed from inception to July 2017 . We used the Cochrane Review risk of bias assessment tool to assess r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) quality . A total of  20 RCTs comprising 1979 adults were included  in our systematic review .  Nine RCTs including 623 participants had sufficient  data to be pooled in a meta- analysis . Participants who  took probiotics or prebiotics  showed significant improvements in  the H1N1 strain seroprotection rate  ( with an odds ratio ( OR ) of 1.83 and a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of 1.19 - 2.82 , p = 0.006 , I² =  0 % ) , the H3N2 strain seroprotection rate  ( OR = 2.85 , 95 % CI = 1.59 - 5.10 , p < 0.001 , I² = 0 % ) ,  and the B strain seroconversion rate  ( OR = 2.11 , 95 % CI = 1.38 - 3.21 , p < 0.001 , I² = 0 % ) . This meta- analysis suggested  that probiotics and prebiotics  are  effective in elevating immunogenicity  by  influencing seroconversion and seroprotection rates  in adults inoculated with influenza vaccines."
"dThis study critically review s the  effectiveness  of  exercise therapy and manual mobilisation  in  acute ankle sprains and functional instability  by conducting a systematic review of r and omised controlled trials . Trials were search ed electronically and manually from  1966 to March 2005 .  R and omised controlled trials that evaluated  exercise therapy  or  manual mobilisation of the ankle joint  with at least one clinical ly relevant outcome measure were included .  Internal validity  of the studies was independently assessed by two review ers . When applicable ,  relative risk ( RR ) or st and ardised mean differences ( SMD )  were calculated for individual and pooled data . In total  17 studies were included .  In thirteen studies the intervention included  exercise therapy  and in four studies the effects of  manual mobilisation  of the ankle joint was evaluated .  Average internal validity score  of the studies was 3.1 ( range 1 to 7 ) on a 10-point scale .  Exercise therapy  was effective in reducing the  risk of recurrent sprains  after acute ankle sprain  :  RR 0.37 ( 95 % CI 0.18 to 0.74 ) , and with  functional instability :  RR 0.38 ( 95 % CI 0.23 to 0.62 ) . No effects of  exercise therapy  were found on  postural sway  in  patients with  functional instability  :  SMD : 0.38 ( 95 % CI -0.15 to 0.91 ) . Four studies demonstrated an initial positive effect of different modes of  manual mobilisation  on  dorsiflexion range of motion .  It is likely that  exercise therapy  , including the use of a wobble board , is effective in the prevention of  recurrent ankle sprains .  Manual mobilisation has an ( initial ) effect on  dorsiflexion range of motion  , but the clinical relevance of these findings for physiotherapy practice may be limited."
"dINTRODUCTION While prescribing  biosimilars  to  patients naive to a biologic treatment  is a well-accepted practice , switching  clinical ly stable patients  from an originator to a biosimilar is an issue for clinicians . Well- design ed clinical trials and real-world data which study the consequences of switching from an originator  biologic treatment  to its biosimilar alternative are limited , especially for monoclonal antibodies . Areas covered : A systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed to identify evidence of the consequences of switching from  original biologics to biosimilars .  References of included papers were also scrutinized . After a title- , abstract - and full text screening , out of the  153 original hits and 77 additional ones from screening  the  references  ,  58 papers ( 12  empirical papers , 5 systematic review s and 41 non-empirical papers  )  were included . Expert opinion : Preventing  patients  on  biologic medicines  from switching to biosimilars due to anticipated risks seems to be disproportional compared to the  expected cost savings and /or improved patient access .  Indeed , it is the opinion of the authors that the concern of switching to biosimilars is overhyped."

">Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in  women .   Neoadjuvant chemotherapy  for  patients with locally advanced cervix cancer  has comparable benefits to  concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT )  , but with fewer side effects . This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the benefits of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  for the management of  locally advanced cervix cancer from stage IB2 ( tumor > 4.0 cm ) to IIIB ( tumor extending to the pelvic wall and /or hydronephrosis ) .  Our primary objective was to assess benefits in terms  of survival  . The data source included the USA national library of medicine , Medline search , and the National Cancer Institute PDQ Clinical Protocol s. Inclusion criteria for consideration in the current systematic review included  studies published between January 1997 and December 2012 .  In terms of histology , they had to be focused on squamous cell  carcinoma  ,  adenosquamous carcinoma  ,  and /or adenocarcinoma . Patients should be either chemotherapy naïve or cervix cancer chemotherapy naïve , and have a performance status ≤2 .  The search in the above-mentioned scientific websites led to identify  49 publications  ,  19 of which were excluded  , as they did not meet the inclusion criteria of this systematic review . Therefore only 30 studies were deemed eligible .  Data was collected from 1760 patients enrolled in the current systematic review study . The mean age was 45.2 years . The mean tumor size was 4.7 cm .  The most commonly used chemotherapies were  cisplatin  doublets .  Paclitaxel  was the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the doublets . The mean chemotherapy cycles were 2.7 . After chemotherapy , patients underwent surgery after a mean time of 2.5 weeks . The st and ard operation was radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy . Chemotherapy achieved  an objective response rate  of 84 % .  The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival  were 61.9 % and 72.8 % respectively . The treatment protocol was associated  with a mild early toxicity profile . Leucopenia and neutropenia  were the most common  side effects . Late toxicity  was also generally mild and mainly associated  with bladder dysfunction and vaginal dehiscence  . The quality of the studies was assessed  using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale   . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy  achieved comparable survival results to CCRT , and was associated  with less toxicity ."
" The HADS ’ efficiency and substantial track record recommend its use where anxiety , mixed affective disorders or general distress are outcomes of interest . However , continuing controversy concerning the  HADS depression  scale caution s against dependence where depressive disorders are of primary interest . Where cost is a concern , the POMS-37 is recommended to measure anxiety or mixed affective disorders but does not offer a suitable index of general distress and , like the HADS , emphasises anhedonia in measuring depression . Where depression is the sole focus , the CES-D is recommended."
 Dietary advice appears effective in increasing  pregnant women 's  energy  and  protein intakes but is unlikely to confer major benefits on infant or maternal health . Balanced energy/protein supplementation improves  fetal growth  and may reduce the  risk of fetal and neonatal death .  High-protein or balanced  protein  supplementation alone is not beneficial and may be harmful to the infant . Protein/energy restriction of  pregnant women who are overweight or exhibit high  weight gain   is unlikely to be beneficial and may be harmful to the infant.
"sBackground Clinical benefits of  recruitment maneuver  in  ARDS patients  are controversial . A number of previous studies showed possible benefits ; a large recent study reported that recruitment maneuver and PEEP titration may even be harmful . This meta- analysis was design ed to compare the clinical utility of  recruitment maneuver  with  low tidal volume ventilation  in  adult patients with ARDS .  Methods  R and omized  controlled trials comparing  recruitment maneuver and lung protective ventilation strategy with lung protective strategy ventilation protocol alone  in  adult patients with ARDS  has been included in this meta- analysis . PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were search ed from inception to 10 November 2017 to identify potentially eligible trials .  Pooled risk ratio ( RR ) and st and ardized mean difference ( SMD )  were calculated for binary and continuous variables respectively . Results  Data of 2480 patients from 7 r and omized controlled trials  have been included in this meta- analysis and systemic review .  Reported mortality  at the longest available follow-up [ RR ( 95 % CI ) 0.93 ( 0.80 , 1.08 ) ; p = 0.33 ] ,  ICU mortality  [ RR ( 95 % CI ) 0.91 ( 0.76 , 1.10 ) ; p = 0.33 ] and  in-hospital mortality  [ RR ( 95 % CI ) 0.95 ( 0.83 , 1.08 ) ; p = 0.45 ] were similar between recruitment maneuver group and st  and ard lung protective ventilation  group  . Duration of hospital stay  [ SMD ( 95 % CI ) 0.00 ( − 0.09 , 0.10 ) ; p =  0.92  ]  and duration of ICU stays  [ SMD ( 95 % CI ) 0.05 ( − 0.09 , 0.19 ) ; p = 0.49 ] were also similar between recruitment maneuver group and st  and ard  lung  protective  ventilation  group . Risk of barotrauma  was also similar . Conclusion  Use of recruitment maneuver  along with co- interventions such as PEEP titration does not provide any  benefit  in  terms of mortality , length of ICU , and hospital stay  in ARDS patients."
"sThe burden of influenza in  Africa  is substantial and underappreciated . Although surveillance has increased , the medical community 's underst and ing of seasonal influenza vaccine performance remains limited . We did a systematic review , using PRISMA guidelines ( PROSPERO CRD42017058107 ) , on the  efficacy , effectiveness , and immunogenicity  of  influenza vaccines   in population s within Africa  with the aim of identifying key data gaps to help direct future research . We search ed Embase , MEDLINE , Global Health data base , and Web of Science for published studies from data base inception to May 9 , 2018 . Unpublished studies were identified by search ing Clinical Trials.gov and the Pan-African Clinical Trial Registry , and by contacting experts within the field . Human studies that reported  influenza vaccine immunogenicity , effectiveness , and efficacy  were  included . 1746 articles were assessed and 23 articles were included .  Only three of the 23 studies were of high quality and many studies were underpowered . All 23 studies came from  only six African countries ( 16 from South Africa )  , highlighting the need for data from a broader range of  African population  s. The majority of studies focused on  effectiveness or efficacy  against laboratory supported influenza with limited data for severe outcomes . Several factors known to interfere with influenza immunisation , such as  malaria , HIV  , and  malnutrition  were under-represented in this Review and require further study . Substantial gaps exist in our underst and ing of influenza vaccine performance across all WHO high-risk groups in  Africa .  Filling these knowledge gaps is vital to guide future influenza vaccine policies."
"  Fluticasone  given at half the daily dose of beclomethasone or budesonide leads to small improvements in  measures of airway calibre  , but it appears to have a higher risk of  causing hoarseness  when given at the same daily dose . Future studies should attempt to establish the relative efficacy of inhaled steroids delivered with CFC-free propellants."
" Due to a small number of clinical and method ologically diverse trials , little can be concluded from this review . There is little evidence to support or refute the use of  acupuncture  for   shoulder pain   although there may be short-term benefit with respect to  pain and function  . There is a need for further well design ed clinical trials."
" To be effective ,  diabetes nutrition therapy  must be individualized . Treatment goals , personal preferences ( eg , tradition , culture , religion , health beliefs and economics ) and the individual׳s ability and willingness to make lifestyle changes all must be considered when educating or counseling individuals with diabetes . A healthy eating pattern emphasizing nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes , regular physical activity and support are important . A reduced energy intake for  persons with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes  and matching insulin to planned carbohydrate intake for insulin users is  nutrition therapy interventions  shown to be effective in achieving glycemic and other metabolic outcomes."
"dThe purpose of this systematic review was to assess the effects of  spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT ) , acupuncture and herbal medicine  for  chronic non-specific LBP .  A comprehensive search was conducted by an experienced librarian from the Cochrane Back Review Group ( CBRG ) in multiple data bases up to December 22 , 2008 .  R  and  omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of adults with chronic non-specific LBP  ,  which evaluated at least one clinical ly relevant , patient-centred outcome measure  were included . Two authors working independently from one another assessed the risk of bias using the criteria recommended by the CBRG and extracted the data . The data were pooled when clinical ly homogeneous and statistically possible or were otherwise qualitatively described . GRADE was used to determine the quality of the evidence . In total ,  35 RCTs ( 8 SMT , 20  acupuncture  , 7  herbal medicine )  , which examined 8,298 patients , fulfilled the inclusion criteria .  Approximately half of these ( 2 SMT , 8  acupuncture  , 7  herbal medicine )  were thought to have a low risk of bias . In general , the pooled effects for the studied interventions demonstrated  short-term relief or improvement  only . The lack of studies with a low-risk of bias , especially in regard to SMT precludes any strong conclusions ; however , the principal findings , which are based upon low- to very-low- quality evidence , suggest that SMT does not provide a more clinical ly beneficial effect compared with sham , passive modalities or any other intervention for treatment of chronic  low-back pain .  There is evidence , however , that  acupuncture  provides a short-term clinical ly relevant effect when compared with a waiting list control or when acupuncture is added to another intervention . Although there are some good results for individual herbal medicines in short-term individual trials , the lack of homogeneity across studies did not allow for a pooled estimate of the effect . In general , these results are in agreement with other recent systematic review s on SMT , but in contrast with others . These results are also in agreement with recent review s on acupuncture and herbal medicine . R and omized trials with a low risk of bias and adequate sample sizes are direly needed."
"dChemotherapy is a cornerstone in treatments of gastric cancer , but despite its benefit , less than 60 % of patients receive salvage therapy in clinical practice . We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis based on trial data on the role of  second-line treatment  of advanced gastric cancer . MEDLINE / PubMed and Cochrane Library were search ed for r and omized phase III trials that compared  active therapy  to  best supportive care  in advanced gastric cancer . Data extraction was conducted according to the PRISMA statement .  Summary HR for OS  was calculated using a hierarchical Bayesian model and subgroup analysis was performed based on baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG ) performance status ( 0 vs. 1 or more ) .  A total of 1,407 patients were evaluable for efficacy , 908 were treated in the experimental arms , with  chemotherapy  ( 231 pts ) or with  targeted therapies  ( 677 pts )  .  The risk of death  was decreased by 18 % ( HR = 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.79 - 0.85 ; posterior probability HR≥1 : < 0.00001 ) with active therapies  . Chemotherapy and ramucirumab  were able to  decrease  this risk by 27 % and 22 % , respectively . No differences were found  between chemotherapy and ramucirumab .  In patients with ECOG = 0 a greater benefit was found  for chemotherapy  with a reduction  of the risk of death  by 43 % and no benefits were found  for ramucirumab or everolimus .  In patients with ECOG = 1 or more a significant  reduction of the risk of death  by 32 % was reported in patients treated  with  ramucirumab , even if no significant difference was reported  between chemotherapy and  ramucirumab . This analysis reports that active and available therapies are able  to prolong survival  in  patients with advanced gastric cancer  with a different outcome based on initial patient 's performance status . New trials based on a better patient stratification are awaited."
"  Prednisolone  in low doses ( not exceeding 15 mg daily ) may be used intermittently in  patients with rheumatoid arthritis  , particularly if the disease can not be controlled by other means . Since prednisolone is highly effective , short-term placebo controlled trials study ing the  clinical effect  of low-dose  prednisolone  or other oral  corticosteroids  are no longer necessary."
"sIntroduction :  Multimodal non-pharmacological interventions ( MNPIs )  have been reported to be effective in improving the  cognitive function .  Therefore , it is necessary to study these interventions in  older people with dementia ( PWD ) in nursing homes ( NHs ) .  Aims : This study aim ed to investigate the effects , contents , frequency  ,  duration , length , and form of  MNPIs  on the  global and specific cognitive functions   of PWD in NHs  through a systematic review , and to consider what kind of intervention design is most effective . Methods : A systematic search of peer- review ed literature published  between January 2008 and October 2018  was performed on the PubMed , Cochrane Library , Web of Science and CINAHL data bases . Results : Six r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and one non- RCTs were extracted from electronic data bases , and a review was carried out . Conclusion : Our review suggests that  MNPIs  may improve  the global , executive function and memory of   PWD in NHs .  The  combination of exercise , cognitive training and activities of daily living , and  intervention at least 3 times a week over at least 8 weeks with , at least 30 min per session using the integrated form is recommended for improving the  global and specific cognitive functions of  PWD in NHs."
"gChronic disease is now the leading cause of death and disability in United  States  . Many chronic illnesses experienced by  older adults  can be prevented or managed through behavior change , making patient counseling an essential component of disease prevention and management .  Motivational Interviewing ( MI )  , a  type of conversational method  , has been effective in eliciting  health behavior changes  in people in a variety of setting s and may also be a useful tool to help older adults change . This review of the literature analyzes current research and describes potential biases of  MI  interventions that have been conducted in primary care setting s  with older adults .   MI  shows promise as a technique to  elicit health behavior change  among older adults . However , further study with this population is needed to evaluate  efficacy  of  MI  interventions in primary care setting."

"nAbstract Recovery from a stroke is a dynamic time-dependent process , in which the central nervous system reorganises to accommo date for the impact of the injury . The purpose of this paper is to review recent longitudinal studies of changes in  brain connectivity  after  stroke .  A systematic review of research papers reporting  functional or effective connectivity  at two or more time points in  stroke patients  was conducted . Stroke leads to an early reduction of  connectivity  in the motor network . With recovery time , the  connectivity  increases and can reach the same levels as in  healthy participants .  The increase in  connectivity  is correlated with functional motor gains . A new , more r and omised pattern of connectivity may then emerge in the longer term . In some instances , a pattern of  increased connectivity  even higher than in  healthy controls  can be observed , and is related either to a specific time point or to a specific neural structure .  Rehabilitation interventions  can help improve  connectivity between specific regions  . Moreover ,  motor network connectivity  undergoes reorganisation during recovery from a stroke and can be related to  behavioural recovery .  A detailed analysis of changes in  connectivity  pattern may enable a better underst and ing of adaptation to a stroke and how compensatory mechanisms in the brain may be supported by rehabilitation."

" This systematic review confirms that overall the  Bobath Concept  is not superior to other approaches . Based on best evidence synthesis , no evidence is available for the superiority of any approach . This review has highlighted many method ological shortcomings in the studies review ed ; further high- quality trials need to be published . Evidence -based guidelines rather than therapist preference should serve as a framework from which therapists should derive the most effective treatment."
" As we did not identify any r and omised controlled trials for inclusion in this review , we are unable to comment on implication s for practice . Although evidence from animal studies has supported a  fetal neuroprotective role  for  creatine  when administered to the mother during pregnancy , no trials assessing  creatine  in  pregnant women  for  fetal neuroprotection  have been published to date . If  creatine  is established as safe for the mother and her fetus , research efforts should first be directed towards r and omised trials comparing  creatine  with either no intervention ( ideally using a  placebo )  , or with alternative agents aim ed at providing  fetal neuroprotection  ( including magnesium sulphate for the very preterm infant ) . If appropriate , these trials should then be followed by studies comparing different  creatine  regimens ( dosage and duration of exposure ) . Such trials should be high quality and adequately powered to evaluate maternal  and  infant short and longer-term outcomes ( including  neurodevelopmental  disabilities such as cerebral palsy ) , and should consider  utilisation/costs  of  health  care."
"dBackground  People with end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD )  develop impaired excretion of phosphate . Hyperphosphatemia develops in ESKD as a result of the kidney 's reduced ability to excrete ingested phosphate load and is characterized by high bone turnover and increased musculoskeletal morbidity including bone pain and muscle weakness . Increased serum phosphate levels are also associated with cardiovascular disease and associated mortality . These effects are significant considering that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in ESKD , making phosphate control a crucial treatment goal . Objectives To determine the effectiveness of  education or behavioral interventions  on  adherence  to  phosphate control  in  adults with ESKD receiving  hemodialysis  ( HD ) .  Inclusion criteria Types of participants  Adults aged over 18 years with ESKD undergoing HD , attending dialysis facilities regardless of frequency and duration of treatment sessions per week . Studies with participants receiving hemodiafiltration were  excluded . Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest All types of  educational and behavioral interventions  aim ed at improving  adherence to dietary phosphate restriction , phosphate binder medication and HD .  Types of studies R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , non- RCTs , before and after and cohort studies . Outcomes Outcome measures included  serum phosphate levels , patient knowledge and adherence to phosphate control methods , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) self-management behavior and perceived self-efficacy for CKD related  to phosphate control . Search strategy A search was conducted in CINAHL , MEDLINE , The Cochrane Library , Embase , Web of Science , PsycINFO and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global to find published studies between January 2005 and December 2015 . Method ological quality Risk of bias was assessed by three review ers prior to inclusion in the review using st and ardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta- Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument ( JBI-MAStARI ) . Data extraction Data were extracted using the st and ardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI . Data synthesis Data were pooled using JBI software .  Mean differences  (  95 % confidence interval [ CI ] )  and  effect size estimates  were calculated for continuous outcomes . Meta- analysis using a r and om-effects model was performed for  serum phosphate levels  , and where the findings could not be pooled using meta- analysis , results have been presented in a narrative form . St and ard GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) evidence assessment of outcomes has been reported . Results A  total of 18 studies were included  in the review : seven studies focused on dietary phosphate , four studies focused on medications ( phosphate binders ) and six studies focused on  dietary phosphate and medications .  Only one study taught patients about  diet , medications and HD to control  phosphate . Sixteen studies showed significant  improvements in phosphate levels .  Meta- analysis of eight RCTs favored  educational or behavioral interventions  over  st and ard care  for  serum phosphate control  , with a weighted mean reduction of −0.23 mmol/l ( 95 % CI −0.37 , −0.08 ) in treatment groups . Conclusion Overall , educational or behavioral interventions  increase adherence to phosphate control  . Studies in this systematic review revealed  improved outcomes on serum phosphate levels , patient knowledge and adherence to phosphate control methods , CKD self-management behavior and perceived self-efficacy  for  CKD  related to phosphate control . However , there is a lack of sufficient data on how some of the studies implemented their interventions , suggesting that further research is required . Successful strategies that improve and optimize  long-term adherence to phosphate control  still need to be formulated."
"OBackground Instruments that measure the  patient-reported outcome and quality of life  are essential to assess the treatment success of any medical intervention . This review represents valid and reliable  outcome assessment  instruments for   tonsillectomy  (  TE  )  and   tonsillotomy   (  TO  )  in adult patients as TE/TO still  belong to one of the most common performed surgical procedures . Methods A systematic review of the literature in the MEDLINE , PubMed , Web of Science and Cochrane Library was conducted . Studies describing reliable and valid   patient-reported outcome measures  ( PROM )  in  adults  with regard to the perioperative as well as postoperative follow-up after TE/TO were examined . Thus , studies without PROMs or PROMs only relating to  children as well  as  studies in non-English/non-German language  or without any detailed information were excluded . Results  Four thous and four hundred forty studies were identified .  Thirteen reliable and valid  patient – reported outcome assessment instruments  presenting the perioperative and postoperative outcome were analysed . Four generic question naires are included that are used to measure the outcome after TE/TO in adults . Four disease-specific question naires relating to  obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) and sleep disordered breathing ( SDB )  as well as two TE/TO specific question naires are vali date d for adults . With regard to the  perioperative outcome  including  parameters like pain , nausea , vomiting ,  satisfaction three assessment instruments are analysed . Conclusion This review describes the currently available , reliable and valid generic and disease-specific instruments assessing the perioperative as well as postoperative outcome to evaluate the treatment success after  TE/TO in adult patients .  Therefore , this study improves the selection of the appropriate patient – reported outcome assessment instrument to assess the quality of life in adults undergoing TE/TO."
" This review shows that  tiotropium  treatment was associated with a significant improvement in  patients ' quality of life  and it reduced the risk of  exacerbations  , with a number needed to treat to benefit ( NNTB ) of 16 to prevent one exacerbation .  Tiotropium  also reduced  exacerbations leading to hospitalisation  but no significant difference was found for  hospitalisation of any cause or mortality .  Thus ,  tiotropium  appears to be a reasonable choice for the management of  patients with stable COPD  , as proposed in guidelines . The trials included in this review showed a difference in the  risk of mortality  when compared with  placebo  depending on the type of  tiotropium delivery  device used . However , these results have not been confirmed in a recent trial when 2.5 mcg or 5 mcg of  tiotropium  via Respimat was used in a direct comparison to the 18 mcg H and ihaler."
"sBackground : Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world , and non-small cell lung cancer accounts for > 75 % of all lung cancer cases .  Cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy  has become the st and ard treatment for locally advanced non-small  cell lung  cancer ( NSCLC ) .  Third-generation chemotherapy agents plus cisplatin  have been most commonly used in  concurrent chemoradiotherapy  , which is also associated with more adverse  effects  and  acute toxicities .   S-1  as an oral chemotherapeutic agent exhibits higher antitumor  activity  , less adverse effects , and better biological availability . Recently , studies illustrated  S-1-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy  also had excellent  effects  in the treatment of  locally advanced NSCLC .  Methods : A systematic literature search will be performed through February 2018 using MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and Google Scholar for relevant articles published in any language . R and omized controlled trials and prospect i ve comparative studies will be included . All meta-analyses will be performed using Review Manager software . The quality of the studies will be evaluated using the guidelines listed in the Cochrane H and book . The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses statements will be followed until the findings of the systematic review and meta- analysis are reported . Results : The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis will be published in a peer- review ed journal . Conclusion : Our study will draw an objective conclusion of the  efficacy and safety  of  S-1-based chemoradiotherapy  in the treatment of  locally advanced unresectable NSCLC  and provides level I evidence for clinical decision makings."
"eBackground The aim of the study was to assess the  efficacy and safety  of  tofacitinib  and its impact on  quality of life  in  patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis .  Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of  r and omized  controlled trials comparing  tofacitinib with placebo  or  any active comparator .  We search ed Medline , Embase , the Cochrane Library and gray literature for articles published up to May 2017 . We synthesized data using a fixed-effect model . We conducted subgroup analysis based on prior exposure to anti-tumor necrosis  factor  ( TNF ) . We summarized the strength of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach . Results  We included three trials with 1220 participants .  Compared with  placebo ,  tofacitinib was effective in  inducing clinical remission  ( odds ratio [ OR ] 3.84 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 2.29 - 6.44 , I2 : 41 % , GRADE : moderate ) ,  clinical response  ( OR 2.95 , 95%CI 2.21 - 3.95 , I2 : 0 % , GRADE : high ) ,  mucosal healing  ( OR 2.70 , 95%CI 1.81 - 4.03 , I2 : 0 % , GRADE : high ) . Tofacitinib was effective in both anti-TNF-naïve and -experienced patients . Tofacitinib had a favorable  effect on quality of life .  There were no significant differences in the  safety profile  in terms of the  incidence of any or serious adverse events  compared to placebo . The  risk for infections  was increased ( OR 1.51 , 95%CI 1.05 - 2.19 , I2 : 0 % , GRADE : moderate ) , but the  incidence of serious infections  did not differ between tofacitinib  and  placebo . Conclusion In  patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis  , short-term treatment  with tofacitinib  is  effective for induction of remission  and improvement of quality of life."
" Given the fact that the use of  rifampin  in an outbreak setting might lead to the circulation of isolates resistant to rifampin , use of  ciprofloxacin  or  ceftriaxone  should be considered .  Placebo-controlled  trials do not seem ethical as prophylactic treatment has been proven to reduce the risk of disease among household contacts . More trials comparing the  effectiveness  of  ceftriaxone  ,  ciprofloxacin  and  rifampin  for  eradicating N. meningitidis  could provide important insights."
" Overall , there was no clear benefit from  acupuncture  or  acupressure  in reducing  caesarean section rate .  The quality of the evidence varied between low to high . Few trials reported on  neonatal morbidity or maternal mortality outcomes .   Acupuncture  showed some benefit in improving  cervical maturity  , however , more well- design ed trials are needed . Future trials could include clinical ly relevant safety outcomes."
">Background COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease . Potential biomarkers to identify  patients with COPD who will derive the greatest benefit from  inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS )  treatment  are needed .  Blood eosinophil count  can serve as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of ICS treatment . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to assess whether a blood eosinophil count of ≥2 % in  patients undergoing  ICS  therapy  was associated with a greater reduction  in COPD exacerbation rate and pneumonia incidence  . Material s and methods An electronic search was performed using the keywords "" COPD "" , "" eosinophil "" , and "" clinical trial "" in the PubMed and EMBASE data bases to retrieve  articles  ,  up to 2017  , relevant to our focus . Data were extracted , and a meta- analysis was conducted using RevMan 5 ( version 5.3.5 ) . Results  Five studies comprising 12,496 patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD were included .  At baseline , 60 %  of  the patients  had ≥2  % blood  eosinophils  . Our meta- analysis showed a 17 %  reduction in exacerbation of moderate/severe COPD  in patients with ≥2 % blood eosinophils  undergoing  ICS therapy compared to  the non-ICS/ICS withdrawal/placebo  group . The difference between the two types of treatment was significant ( risk ratio [ RR ] , 0.816 ; 95 % CI , 0.67 - 0.99 ; P=0.03 ) .  Furthermore , the risk of pneumonia-related  events was significantly increased in the subgroup with eosinophil count ≥2 % undergoing ICS-containing treatments ( RR , 1.969 ; 95 % CI , 1.369 - 2.833 ; P<0.001 ) . There was no significant difference in the subgroup  with eosinophil  count < 2 % ( RR , 1.29 ; 95 % CI , 0.888 - 1.879 ; P<0.181 ) . Conclusion The results of our meta- analysis suggest that the 2 % threshold for blood eosinophils could accurately predict ICS treatment response in  patients with COPD  , but  increased the risk of pneumonia ."
"sAcupuncture is a popular complementary treatment option in human medicine . Increasingly , owners also seek  acupuncture  for their  animals .  The aim of the systematic review reported here was to summarize and assess the clinical evidence for or against the effectiveness of  acupuncture  in  veterinary medicine .  Systematic search es were conducted on Medline , Embase , Amed , Cinahl , Japana Centra Revuo Medicina and Chikusan Bunken Kensaku . H and - search es included conference proceedings , bibliographies , and contact with experts and veterinary acupuncture associations . There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication . All controlled clinical trials testing  acupuncture  in any condition of  domestic animals  were included .  Studies using laboratory animals  were excluded . Titles and abstract s of identified articles were read , and hard copies were obtained . Inclusion and exclusion of studies , data extraction , and validation were performed independently by two review ers . Method ologic  quality  was evaluated by means of the Jadad  score  .  Fourteen r and omized controlled trials and 17 nonr and omized controlled trials  met our criteria and were , therefore , included . The  method ologic quality  of these trials was variable but , on average , was low . For  cutaneous pain and diarrhea  , encouraging evidence exists that warrants further investigation in rigorous trials . Single studies reported some positive intergroup differences for  spinal cord injury , Cushing 's syndrome , lung function , hepatitis , and rumen acidosis .  These trials require independent replication . On the basis of the findings of this systematic review , there is no compelling evidence to recommend or reject  acupuncture  for any condition in  domestic animals .  Some encouraging data do exist that warrant further investigation in independent rigorous trials."

"2OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to verify the efficacy of using  theory-based strategies on implementation intentions  in   promoting  physical activity  (  PA  )  among adults .  METHODS This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations . The search was carried out in seven electronic data bases ( LILACS , PubMed , SciELO , Cochrane , Web of Science ) and two search es of the "" grey literature "" were performed ( Openthesis and OpenGrey ) .  R and omized clinical trials ( RCT ) , published up to September 2016 , were  considered eligible for this study . Two review ers independently and systematic ally evaluated the eligibility criteria , and performed data extraction . A meta- analysis was performed for the purpose of comparing the effect between the intervention and control groups . The effect sizes were grouped in two subgroups with the purpose of more accurately verifying the effect caused by reinforcing the  implementation intentions  strategy , and using the inverse variance statistical method with r and om effects models to estimate the main effect of the implementation  intention  strategy on the PA behavior . Heterogeneity among the studies was evaluated by using I-square statistics , and the Jadad scale to evaluate the quality of included papers . RESULTS The search result ed in  12,147 records , of which 13 RCTs were considered eligible  for this review .  Sample age ranged from 18 to 76 years , and participants had conditions such as  medullary lesion , coronary disease , obesity , diabetes mellitus , sedentarism or occupational stress .   When the summary of the effect was analyzed in the meta- analysis , the result found in the subgroup with reinforcement of the implementation intentions strategy was 0.25 ( IC 95 % = 0.05 - 0.45 ) in favor of the intervention group . This demonstrated that application of the  implementation intentions  strategy was capable of  increasing PA practice  in the participants of these studies , in comparison with others that did not use this reinforcement .  The findings of this review indicated that  application of the theory of implementation intentions  promoted  PA behavior  among the  adults who received reinforcement of  this strategy . The systematic review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO data base under the number CRD42018090482."
" Overall ,  people after stroke  who  receive treadmill training  , with or without body weight support , are not more likely to improve their  ability to walk independently  compared with people after stroke not  receiving treadmill training  ,  but walking speed and walking endurance  may improve slightly in the short term . Specifically ,  people with stroke who are able to walk  ( but not  people who are dependent in walking at start of treatment  ) appear to benefit most from this type of intervention with  regard to walking speed and walking endurance  . This review did not find , however , that  improvements in walking speed and endurance  may have persisting beneficial effects . Further research should specifically investigate the effects of different frequencies , duration s , or intensities ( in terms of speed increments and inclination )  of treadmill training  , as well as the use of h and rails , in ambulatory participants , but not in  dependent walkers ."
" AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATION S Adding  capnography  to  st and ard monitoring  of adults during moderate sedation may reduce the  risk of developing hypoxemia  , increase  detection of adverse respiratory events  , and is not associated with additional  harms .  These findings suggest routine use of  capnography  during moderate sedation has the potential to reduce adverse anesthetic  outcomes  in dental practice."
" Incomplete and inconsistent reporting of ( 1 ) training components , ( 2 ) underlying exercise training principles and ( 3 ) patient adherence together with ( 4 ) a broad variation in the method ological quality of the included RCTs limit both the utility and reproducibility of  physical exercise programs  in stroke patients."
"eBackground The results of many clinical trials and experimental studies regarding acupoint specificity are contradictory . This review aims to investigate whether a difference in  efficacy  exists between  ordinary  acupuncture   on specific acupoints and  sham acupuncture controls  on non-acupoints or on irrelevant acupoints . Methods Data bases including Medline , Embase , AMED and Chinese Biomedical Data base were search ed to identify  r and omized controlled trials published between 1998 and 2009 that  compared   traditional body acupuncture   on  acupoints   with sham  acupuncture controls   on irrelevant acupoints or non-acupoints with the same needling depth . The Cochrane Collaboration 's tool for assessing risk of bias was employed to address the quality of the included trials . Results  Twelve acupuncture clinical trials with sham  acupuncture  controls were identified and included  in the review . The conditions treated varied . Half of the included trials had positive results on the primary outcomes and demonstrated  acupoint specificity .  However , among those six trials ( total sample size : 985 ) with low risk of bias , five trials ( sample size : 940 ) showed  no statistically significant difference  between proper and  sham  acupuncture treatments . Conclusion This review did not demonstrate the existence of  acupoint specificity .  Further clinical trials with larger sample sizes , optimal acupuncture treatment protocol s and appropriate  sham acupuncture  controls are required to resolve this important issue."
"lDespite upper extremity function playing a crucial role in maintaining one ’s independence in activities of daily living , upper extremity impairments remain one of the most prevalent post-stroke deficits . To enhance the  upper extremity motor recovery and performance  among  stroke survivors  , two training paradigms in the fields of  robotics therapy  involving modifying  haptic feedback  were proposed :  the error-augmentation ( EA ) and error-reduction ( ER ) paradigms .  There is a lack of consensus , however , as to which of the two paradigms yields superior training effects . This systematic review aim ed to determine ( i ) whether  EA  is more effective than  conventional repetitive practice  ; ( ii ) whether  ER  is more effective than  conventional repetitive practice  and ; ( iii ) whether  EA  is more effective than ER in improving  post-stroke upper extremity motor recovery and performance .  The study search and selection process as well as the ratings of method ological quality of the articles were conducted by two authors separately , and the results were then compared and discussed among the two review ers . Findings were analyzed and synthesized using the level of evidence .  By August 1st 2017 , 269 articles were found after search ing 6 data bases , and 13 were selected based on criteria such as sample size , type of participants recruited , type of interventions used , etc  . Results suggest , with a moderate level of evidence , that  EA  is overall  more effective  than   conventional  repetitive practice ( motor recovery and performance ) and ER ( motor performance only )  , while ER appears to be no more effective than conventional repetitive practice . However ,  intervention  effects as measured using clinical  outcomes  were under most instance not ‘ clinical ly meaningful ’ and effect sizes were modest . While stronger evidence is required to further support the efficacy of error modification therapies , the influence of factors related to the delivery of the intervention ( such as intensity , duration ) and personal factors ( such as stroke severity and time of stroke onset ) deserves further investigations as well."
"eBackground : Terminal illness not only causes physical suffering but also spiritual distress .  Spiritual care  has been widely implemented by healthcare professionals to assist patients coping with spiritual distress . However , the effects of spiritual care need to be clear . Aim : To evaluate the effects of  spiritual care  on  quality of life and spiritual well-being  among  patients with terminal illness .  Design : Systematic review according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidance . Data sources : A comprehensive search was conducted in  nine electronic data bases from date of inception to May 2017 .  H and search es of the bibliographies of relevant articles were also performed . The studies were independently review ed by two investigators who scored them for method ological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool . Results : No statistical pooling of outcomes was performed and a narrative summary was chosen to describe the included studies . A total of  19 studies with 1548 participants were identified in the systematic review  , corresponding to seven kinds of interventions . The risk of bias for these studies were all rated as moderate . A majority of studies indicated that spiritual care had a potential  beneficial effect on quality of life and spiritual well-being  among  patients with terminal illness .  Conclusion : It is suggested that healthcare professionals  integrate spiritual care with usual care in palliative care .  When providing  spiritual care  , healthcare professionals should take into consideration patients ’ spiritual needs , preference , and cultural background . More multicenter and disciplinary studies with rigorous design s are needed in the future."
" : Two of the three trials demonstrated improved  primary outcomes  with the use of  NMBA .  The third trial was underpowered ( due to unanticipated low mortality in the control group ) and did not show a statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome . As all the original research was conducted by the same group , further investigation is necessary to assess generalizability and confirm results . Currently , additional research is underway , focusing on early enrollment and narrow inclusion criteria . Implication s for practice : Secondary analysis from two separate groups concluded the improved outcomes , with no evidence of  increased risk of critical illness polyneuropathy or myopathy  , suggest that the use of  NMBAs  in severe ARDS is appropriate."
"eBACKGROUND Most survival studies comparing  non-radical resections  to  bypass surgery  in  patients with pancreatic cancer  often do not differentiate between an R1 and R2 resection . The aim of this study was to evaluate whether non-radical R1 and R2 resections have better  postoperative outcomes  and  survival  compared to a  palliative bypass .  METHODS A single center cohort study was performed analyzing  mortality , morbidity and 1-year survival  after  R1  ( tumor cells within 1 mm from the circumferential margin )  , R2 and bypass surgery  in  patients with pancreatic cancer .  For the systematic review , studies were identified comparing  R1 or R2 resections  with  bypass  , in  patients with pancreatic cancer .  Postoperative outcomes were compared including the cohort study . RESULTS  The cohort study ( n=405 )  showed  higher morbidity rates  after R1 ( n=191 ) and R2 ( n=11 ) resections compared to  bypass  ( 52 % and 73 % vs. 34 % , p < 0.01 ) .  In-hospital mortality  did not differ ( overall 1.7 % ) .  1-year survival rates  were 71 % , 46 % and 32 % after R1 , R2 resection and  bypass  ( p=0.6 between R2 and bypass  )  . The systematic review identified 8 studies , after including the cohort study  1535 patients were analyzed .   Increased morbidity  after R1-R2 resection ( 48 % ) compared to  bypass  ( 30 - 34 % ) was found .  Median survival  was 14 - 18 months after R1 resection vs. 9 - 13 months after  bypass  and 8.5 - 11.5 months after R2 resection vs. 7.5 - 10.7 months after  bypass .   An R2 resection should be avoided in  patients with pancreatic cancer  due to its poor prognosis . Survival benefit after an R1 resection , as compared to  bypass surgery  , justifies a resection despite the increased morbidity rate."
"AKnee   osteoarthritis  (  KOA ) is a common chronic degenerative disease of the elderly .  Electro-acupuncture ( EA )  is considered as a beneficial treatment for KOA , but the conclusion is controversial . This systematic review compiled the evidence from  11 r and omized controlled trials  to objective ly assess the effectiveness and safety of  EA  for KOA . Eight data bases including PubMed , Cochrane Library , Clinic trials , Foreign Medical Literature Retrial Service ( FMRS ) , Science Direct , China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) , Chinese Scientific Journal Data base ( VIP ) , and Wanfang Data were extensively search ed up to 5 July 2016 . The outcomes included the  evaluation of effectiveness , pain and physical function .  Risk of bias was evaluated according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool .  Eleven RCTs with 695 participants were included .  Meta- analysis indicated that  EA  was more effective than  pharmacological treatment  ( RR [ Formula : see text ] 1.14 ; 95 % CI [ Formula : see text ] 1.01,1.28 ; [ Formula : see text ] ) and  manual acupuncture  ( RR [ Formula : see text ] 1.12 ; 95 % CI [ Formula : see text ] 1.02,1.22 ; [ Formula : see text ] ) . Also ,  EA  had a more significant effect in  reducing the pain intensity  ( SMD [ Formula : see text ] ; 95 % CI [ Formula : see text ] ; [ Formula : see text ] ) and  improving the physical function  in the perspective  of WOMAC  ( MD [ Formula : see text ] ; 95 % CI [ Formula : see text ] , 5.56 ; [ Formula : see text ] ) and  LKSS  ( pharmacological treatment : MD [ Formula : see text ] ; 95 % CI [ Formula : see text ] , 6.64 ; [ Formula : see text ] ) . Furthermore , these studies implied  that EA  should be performed for at least 4 weeks . Conclusively , the results indicate  that EA  is a great opportunity to remarkably  alleviate the pain and improve the physical function   of KOA patients  with a low risk of adverse reaction . Therefore , more high quality RCTs with rigorous methods of design , measurement and evaluation are needed to confirm the long-term effects  of EA  for KOA."
"sSpirituality is among the re sources that many turn to as they deal with a diagnosis of  advanced cancer .  Research ers have made much progress in exploring and underst and ing spirituality ’s complex and multifaceted role in the midst of  metastatic  disease . As a result , spirituality is seen as an important aspect of a holistic and respectful approach to clinical care for  patients  and their loved ones . In this article , we provide a systematic review of the literature related to the interface between spirituality and  metastatic cancer . We included articles published from January 2013 to June 2014 .  Twenty-two articles were review ed , consisting of clinical intervention trials , association studies , surveys , qualitative studies , and review articles . The articles discussed efforts to improve patients ’  spiritual well-being  , with relevant measurement scales ; the associations of spirituality and end of life treatment practice s ; and efforts to better underst and and meet the spiritual needs of patients and caregivers."
 There are very limited data from r and omised trials of feeding  preterm or low birth weight infants  with formula milk compared with preterm human milk . This may relate to a perceived difficulty of allocating an alternative enteral feed to an infant in cases where the infant 's mother wishes to feed with expressed breast milk.
"tBACKGROUND Maternal  fish  consumption during pregnancy has been positively associated with  cognitive and visual abilities  in the  offspring  , leading to the hypothesis that maternal  omega-3 ( n-3 ) long-chain PUFA ( LCPUFA ) supplementation  improves  children 's  neurologic and visual development . OBJECTIVE The objective was to evaluate the effect of  maternal omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation  in pregnancy on  neurologic and visual development  in the  offspring .  DESIGN Five electronic data bases were search ed . Human r and omized controlled trials that supplemented the maternal  diet  with  omega-3 LCPUFAs  during pregnancy , or pregnancy and lactation , and that assessed either  neurologic or visual development  of the offspring were included . Trial quality was assessed , and the results of eligible trials were compared in meta-analyses . RESULTS  Eleven RCTs involving 5272 participants  were included in the review . Most trials had method ologic limitations . No differences in  st and ardized psychometric test scores for cognitive , language , or motor development  were observed between the LCPUFA-supplemented and control groups , except for  cognitive scores  in  2 - 5-y-old children  , in whom supplementation result ed in higher  Developmental St and ard Scores  ( mean difference : 3.92 ; 95 % CI : 0.77 , 7.08 ; n = 156 ; P = 0.01 ) . However , this effect was from 2 trials with a high risk of bias . Because of the variety of visual assessment s and age ranges , it was not possible to combine studies with visual outcomes in a meta- analysis , although 6 of the 8 assessment s in 5 trials reported no difference between the supplemented and control groups .  The evidence does not conclusively support or refute that  omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation  in pregnancy improves cognitive or visual development."
"tOBJECTIVE To assess the evidence for the  long-term effectiveness  of  biofeedback  for the treatment of  essential hypertension in adults .  METHODS A systematic review following accepted international guidelines was conducted . R and omized controlled trials that compared  biofeedback procedures with antihypertensive medication , placebo ( sham biofeedback treatment ) , no intervention or other behavioural treatments  were included . The outcome measure was  change in blood pressure .  RESULTS The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by  36 trials .  Twenty-one trials employed  biofeedback treatment with no adjunctive therapy  , whereas 15 others used  biofeedback treatment alongside another treatment .  The majority of trials were small with no posttreatment follow-up or follow-up of less than 6 months . Qualitative heterogeneity of the included studies ( e.g. poor quality of the trials , differences in interventions and inconsistencies in the measurement of outcomes ) meant that it was inappropriate to pool data in the form of a meta- analysis . A narrative summary of the data based on trial authors ' conclusions is presented . No studies reported  long-term  ( > 12 months  ) follow-up  of patients . Data were grouped first by treatment type and then by comparator . Trial results were variable and conflicting , demonstrating no clear benefits of   biofeedback   in relation to moderation of hypertension .  Although there may be other reported life benefits to its use , we found no convincing evidence that consistently demonstrates the effectiveness of the use of any particular  biofeedback treatment  in the control of essential hypertension when compared with  pharmacotherapy , placebo , no intervention  or  other behavioural therapies .  Any future research needs to be conducted using accepted quality st and ards and given current guidelines for the treatment of hypertension is likely to be considered only as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment."
"sAcupuncture treatment has been widely used for many conditions , while results of the increasing numbers of r and omized trials and systematic review s remain controversial .  Acupuncture  is a complex intervention of both specific and non-specific factors associated with therapeutic benefit . Apart from needle insertion , issues such as  needling sensation , psychological factors , acupoint specificity , acupuncture manipulation , and needle duration  also have relevant influences on the therapeutic effects of  acupuncture .  Taking these factors into consideration would have considerable implication s for the design and interpretation of clinical trials."

"sABSTRACT Background :  Cooking and food skills interventions  have grown in popularity ; however , there is a lack of transparency as to how these interventions were design ed , highlighting a need to identify and underst and the mechanisms of behavior change so that effective components may be introduced in future work . This study critiques  cooking and food skills interventions  in relation to their design , behavior change techniques ( BCTs ) , theoretical underpinnings , and outcomes . Methods : A 40-item  CALO-RE taxonomy  was used to examine the components of  59  cooking and food skills interventions  identified by two systematic review s.  Studies were coded by three independent coders . Results : The three most frequently occurring BCTs identified were # 1 Provide  information  on  consequences of behavior in general  ; # 21 Provide instruction on  how  to  perform the behavior  ; and # 26 Prompt Practice . Fifty-six interventions reported positive  short-term outcomes .  Only 14 interventions reported long-term outcomes containing BCTs relating to information provision . Conclusion : This study review ed  cooking and food skills interventions  highlighting the most commonly used BCTs , and those associated with long-term positive outcomes for cooking skills and diet . This study indicates the potential for using the BCT CALO-RE taxonomy to inform the design , planning , delivery and evaluation of future interventions."

" Short- and long-term outcomes of interest for this review were poorly reported . Current evidence is confounded by the large variety of  exercise interventions .  There was insufficient high- quality evidence to be able to determine any differences between  exercise  and  control  groups for our outcomes of interest . For the woman , both  fasting and postpr and ial blood glucose concentrations  were reduced compared with the control groups . There are currently insufficient data for us to determine if there are also benefits for the infant . The quality of the evidence in this review ranged from high to low quality and the main reason for downgrading was for risk of bias and imprecision ( wide CIs , low event rates and small sample size ) .  Development of type 2 diabetes , perineal trauma/tearing , postnatal depression , large-for-gestational age , adiposity  ( neonate/infant , childhood or adulthood )  , diabetes  ( childhood or adulthood )  or neurosensory disability  ( neonate/infant ) were not reported as outcomes in the included studies .Further research is required comparing different types  of exercise interventions  with  control groups  or with another  exercise intervention  that reports on both the short- and long-term outcomes ( for both the mother and infant/child ) as listed in this review."

" Low quality evidence suggests that AZA is more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission in  Crohn 's disease .  Although AZA may be effective for maintenance of remission its use is limited by adverse  effects .  Low quality evidence suggests that AZA may be superior to budesonide for maintenance of remission but because of small study size and high risk of bias , this result should be interpreted with caution . No conclusions can be drawn from the other active comparator studies because of low and very low quality evidence . Adequately powered trials are needed to determine the comparative  efficacy  and safety of  AZA  and  6-MP  compared to other active maintenance therapies . Further research is needed to assess the  efficacy and safety  of the use of AZA with infliximab and other biologics and to determine the optimal management strategy for patients quiescent Crohn 's disease."

"yOBJECTIVE  Auricular acupressure ( AA ) therapy  has been widely used in Eastern Asia and Europe to prevent constipation in  leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy .  The aim of this systematic review was to review data from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of  auricular acupressure therapy  for preventing constipation in  leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy .  METHODS Data bases that were search ed from their inception until August 2017 included : MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cochrane Central Register  of  Controlled Trials , as well as  four Chinese data bases [ Chinese BioMedical Data base , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , Wan-Fang Data , and the Chinese WeiPu Data base ]  . In this systematic review , only RCTs that were related to the effects of  auricular acupressure therapy  on preventing  constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy  were included . Study selection , data extraction , and validation were performed independently by two review ers . Quantitative analyses of RCTs were performed using RevMan 5.3 software , and cochrane criteria for risk-of-bias were used to assess the method ological quality of the trials . RESULTS A total of  5  RCTs met the inclusion criteria , and most were of low method ological quality . Participants in the  AA  plus routine care group showed significantly greater improvements in the  Bristol Stool Form ( BSF )  [ MD = 0.55 , 95 % CI ( 0.39 , 0.71 ) , p < 0.01 ] with low heterogeneity ( Chi2 = 5.01 , p = 0.29 , I2 = 20 % ) . Moreover , when compared with routine care alone , meta- analysis of three RCTs indicated favorable statistically significant effects of  AA  plus routine care on the  Constipation Assessment Scale ( CAS )  [ MD = -1.51 , 95 % CI ( -1.89 , -1.14 ) , p < 0.01 ] with low heterogeneity ( Chi2 = 1.63 , p = 0.44 , I2 = 0 % ) . Furthermore , when compared with routine care alone , meta- analysis of two RCTs demonstrated statistically significant effects of  AA  plus routine care on the Patient Assessment  of Constipation- Quality Of Life ( PAC-QOL )  [ MD = -1.28 , 95 % CI ( -1.44 , -1.13 ) , p < 0.01 ] , with low heterogeneity ( Chi2 = 0.19 , p = 0.67 , I2 = 0 % ) .  Taken together , as a potential safety therapy , only weak evidence supported the hypothesis that AA effectively prevented constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy."

":Study Design . Systematic review Objective . To undertake a systematic review of published literature to evaluate  efficacy of  bone graft substitutes   on  radiographic and clinical outcomes  in  single- or double-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) for degenerative disease .  Summary of Background Data . ACDF is one of the most common spinal surgeries completed in the United States . Today  bone graft substitutes including ceramic-based synthetic bone grafts , allografts , bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) , mesenchymal stem cells  , and  bone marrow aspirate  are widely used to enhance fusions ; even though the efficacy of these substitutes is poorly defined . Critical evaluation of these products is necessary to optimize radiographic and clinical outcomes for ACDF in degenerative disease . Methods . A systematic literature  review  of  22 published articles was conducted  . All articles reported results on  patients who underwent a single- or double-level ACDF performed using a  bone graft substitute  and reported results  on   radiographic fusion rates   at least  6 months after surgery .  Results . All studies using BMP showed 100  % fusion rate  despite length of the study or whether additional bone graft substitutes were used . Use of only  ceramic-based synthetics  had the lowest  fusion rate  , 80.5 % . Use of only  mesenchymal stem cells  result ed in an  average fusion rate  of 87.7 % . When used alone ,  allograft  result ed in an  average fusion rate  of 87.3 % . This was significantly influenced by one outlier , Kim et al , which when removed , increased the  fusion rate  to 93.5 % .  Clinical outcomes  were improved postoperatively irrespective of the graft used , although dysphagia was significantly greater in studies using  BMP  ( P < 0.001 ) . Conclusion .  Allograft  alone has the lowest cost with similar fusion  rates  and clinical outcomes compared to other  bone graft substitutes .  Physicians should consider this when choosing to use  bone graft substitutes  for routine ACDFs . Level of Evidence :."
"  Acupuncture  could effectively  relieve depressive syndromes .  The clinical effects of  acupuncture  might be attributable to their influence on three proposed pathways , namely , the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , the locus coeruleus (LC)-immunity pathway , and the negative feedback loop of the hippocampus . Nevertheless , conclusions are limited due to the small number of studies included and the low- quality of the study design s. In the future , a cross-sectional study is needed to test the proposed plausible pathways . PROSPERO registration number is CRD42017080937."

" The data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of  acupuncture  for acute low-back pain . For chronic low-back pain ,  acupuncture  is more effective for  pain relief and functional improvement  than no treatment or  sham treatment  immediately after treatment and in the short-term only .  Acupuncture  is not more effective than other conventional and "" alternative "" treatments . The data suggest that  acupuncture and dry-needling  may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain . Because most of the studies were of lower method ological quality , there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area."

"CWith the obvious benefit from  low dose computed tomography  to reduce the lung cancer-specific mortality , lung cancer screening is on the rise . With the implementation of the screening programs , diagnosis of early stage lung cancer is expected to increase , and  small cell lung  cancer ( SCLC ) would account for 10 % of screen-detected lung cancer . Apart from  Concurrent chemoradiation ( CRT )  , the present guidelines virtually do not support other options for  radiation (  RT  )  . There is a paucity of data addressing the role of  Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT )  in SCLC and we conducted the current systematic review on this topic . We systematic ally search ed literature using the electronic data bases PubMed and Embase with no language , year or publication status restrictions . After  removal of duplicate records , 3469 screened , 3446 excluded with reasons , 23 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility , and 7 studies ( 8 reports ) were included .  Unsuitability  for surgery  or  refusal  for surgery was the most common reason for the use of  SBRT  in early stage SCLC in the included studies . Variable patterns of  SBRT — chemotherapy ( CT )  sequencing including concurrent , pre-CT and post-CT and radiation doses were noted . Within the reported studies  overall survival ( OS )  at 1 year , 2 year and 3 year varied from 63 % to 87 % , 37 % to 72 % , and 35 % to 72 % , respectively .  Distant metastasis  was the most common pattern of failure ranging from 38 % to 53 % . There was no increase in the  reported grade III toxicity .   SBRT  could be a potential option in stage I SCLC with comparable outcomes with  no added toxicity .  Acknowledging the limitations and absence of high- quality data , presently cautious interpretation is warranted and further studies are needed to establish the role of  SBRT  in SCLC."
"hBACKGROUND  Leukotriene-receptor antagonists ( LTRAs )  are recommended as an alternative treatment in  patients with mild asthma  , but their effect compared with placebo is unclear . PURPOSE To determine the benefits and harms of  LTRAs  as monotherapy or in combination with inhaled corticosteroids compared with  placebo  in  adults and adolescents with asthma .  DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through June 2015 . STUDY SELECTION Peer- review  ed , English- language , r and omized , controlled trials in patients with asthma  that reported the effect of  LTRAs versus placebo  on measures of asthma control . DATA EXTRACTION Three research ers extracted data on study population , interventions , outcome measures , and adverse events . One research er assessed risk of bias . DATA SYNTHESIS Of the 2008 abstract s that were screened  , 50 trials met eligibility criteria  . R and om-effects meta-analyses of 6 trials of LTRA monotherapy showed that LTRAs reduced the  risk for an exacerbation  ( summary risk ratio [ RR ] , 0.60 [ 95 % CI , 0.44 to 0.81 ] ) . In 4 trials of LTRAs as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids , the  summary RR for exacerbation  was 0.80 ( CI , 0.60 to 1.07 ) .  Leukotriene-receptor antagonists  either as monotherapy or as add-on therapy to  inhaled  corticosteroids  increased FEV1  , whereas  FEV1  percentage of predicted values was improved only in trials of LTRA monotherapy .  Adverse event rates  were similar in the intervention and comparator groups . LIMITATION Variation in definitions and reporting of outcomes , high risk of bias in some studies , heterogeneity of findings , possible selective outcome reporting bias , and inability to assess the effect of asthma severity on summary estimates .   Leukotriene-receptor antagonists  as monotherapy improved  asthma  control compared with  placebo  , but which patients are most likely to respond to treatment with LTRAs remains unclear .

"sVarious  kinetic parameters  , based on a minimum of two time points , have been built with CA125 determinations . The aim of this study is to review studies about the clinical application of CA125-related  tumor cell kinetics variables  in  patients with advanced ovarian cancer ( AOC ) receiving  chemotherapy .   A literature search for studies about CA125-related variables in  patients with AOC  was undertaken on three data bases , by predefined search criteria , and a selection of studies was performed .  Sixty-two studies were selected .  CA125-related variables were summarized in three groups :  response-related , time-to-event ,  and other CA125-related  tumor cell kinetics variables .  Even though  CA125 changes and half-life after chemotherapy  were the most studied , other variables and two models have been well defined , and often showed an interesting power to predict  survival .  These kinetics variables are related to the CA125 regression curve , pre- and post-chemotherapy kinetics , or are variables inferred from a population model of CA125 kinetics."

Women underreported prepregnancy ( PPW : -2.94 to -0.29 kg ) and  delivery weight  ( DW : -1.28  to  0.07  kg ) , and  over-reported  gestational weight gain  ( GWG : 0.33  to  3  kg ) . Magnitude of  error  was small , ranged widely , and varied by prepregnancy weight class and race/ethnicity . Misclassification was moderate ( PPW : 0 - 48.3 % ; DW : 39.0 - 49.0 % ; GWG : 16.7 - 59.1 % ) , and overestimated some estimates of population prevalence . However , reporting error did not largely bias associations  between pregnancy-related weight and birth outcomes .  Although measured weight is preferable , self-report is a cost-effective and practical measurement approach . Future research ers should develop bias correction techniques for self-reported pregnancy-related weight."
"dThe aim of this review is to evaluate the  effectiveness  and safety of  acupuncture  for  poor semen quality in infertile men .  We search ed for relevant trials registered up to May 2013 in 14 data bases . We selected r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that compared  acupuncture , with or without additional treatment , against placebo , sham , no treatment , or the same additional treatment .  Two review ers independently performed the study selection , data extraction , risk of bias and reporting quality appraisal . Risk of bias and reporting quality were appraised by the Cochrane risk of bias tool , the consoli date d st and ards of reporting trials and St and ards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of  Acupuncture .  The outcomes were  sperm motility , sperm concentration , pregnancy rate , and adverse events .  Pregnancy was defined as a positive pregnancy test . Four RCTs met the eligibility criteria .  Acupuncture  increased  the percentage of sperm with rapid progression  ( mean difference - 6.35 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 4.38 - 8.32 , P < 0.00001 )  and sperm concentration  ( mean difference - 6.42 , 95 % CI : 4.91 - 7.92 , P < 0.00001 ) , but these two outcomes were substantially heterogeneous among the studies ( I² = 72 % and 58 % , respectively ) . No  differences in pregnancy rate  were found  between  acupuncture and control groups ( odds ratio 1.60 , 95 % CI : 0.70 - 3.69 , P= 0.27 , I² = 0 % ) .  No  participants  experienced adverse  events . The current evidence showing  that acupuncture  might  improve poor semen quality  is insufficient because of the small number of studies , inadequacy of procedures and /or insufficient information for semen analysis , high levels of heterogeneity , high risk of bias , and poor quality of reporting . Further large , well- design ed RCTs are required."

"eThe aims of this systematic review were to study the  analgesic effect  of  real acupuncture  and to explore whether  sham acupuncture ( SA )  type is related to the estimated effect of  real acupuncture  for  musculoskeletal pain .  Five data bases were search ed . The outcome was  pain or disability  immediately ( ≤1 week ) following an intervention . St and ardized  mean differences  ( SMDs ) with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated . Meta-regression was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity .  Sixty-three studies ( 6382 individuals ) were included .  Eight condition types were included .  The pooled effect size  was moderate  for pain relief  ( 59 trials , 4980 individuals , SMD -0.61 , 95 % CI -0.76 to -0.47 ; P < 0.001 ) and  large for disability improvement  ( 31 trials , 4876 individuals , -0.77 , -1.05 to -0.49 ; P < 0.001 ) . In a univariate meta-regression model , sham needle location and /or depth could explain most or all heterogeneities for some conditions ( e.g. , shoulder pain , low back pain , osteoarthritis , myofascial pain , and fibromyalgia ) ; however , the interactions between subgroups via these covariates were not significant ( P < 0.05 ) . Our review provided low- quality evidence  that real acupuncture  has a moderate effect ( approximate 12-point reduction on the 100-mm visual analogue scale ) on  musculoskeletal pain  . SA type did not appear to be related to the estimated effect of real acupuncture."
" Search es of bibliographical data bases revealed  33 trials  investigating the effects of 27 different drugs on  OSA severity and /or symptoms .  The mechanisms by which these drugs are supposed to improve  OSA  include , amongst others , an  increase in tone of the upper airways , an increase in ventilatory drive , a reduction in airway resistance , and alterations in surface tension forces in the upper airway .  In most of these studies there was no significant  effect on OSA  observed . However , there is evidence from a few small trials that some drugs , especially those thought to increase upper airway muscle tone , have the potential to reduce  OSA severity ;  but further data from larger studies of adequate duration are needed."
"sObjective : To determine the effects of  ankle-foot orthoses ( AFOs )  on  gait , balance , gross motor function  and activities of daily living in  children with cerebral palsy .  Data sources : Five data bases were search ed ( Pubmed , Psycinfo , Web of Science , Academic Search Premier and Cochrane Library ) before January 2018 . Review methods : Studies of the effect of  AFOs  on  gait  ,  balance  , gross motor function and activities of daily living in  children with cerebral palsy  were included .  Articles with a modified PEDRO score ≥ 5/9 were selected .  Data regarding population , AFO , interventions and outcomes were extracted . When possible ,  st and ardized mean differences ( SMDs )  were calculated from the outcomes . Results :  Thirty-two articles , corresponding to 56 studies ( 884 children ) were included . Fifty-one studies included children with spastic cerebral palsy .    AFOs  increased stride length  ( SMD = 0.88 , P <  0.001 ) and gait speed  ( SMD = 0.28 , P  < 0.001 ) , and decreased cadence  ( SMD =  –0.72 , P < 0.001 ) . Gross motor function scores improved ( Gross Motor Function Measure ( GMFM )  D ( SMD = 0.30 , P = 0.004 ) , E ( SMD = 0.28 , P = 0.02 ) ,  Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory  ( PEDI ) ( SMD = 0.57 , P < 0.001 )  )  . Data  relating to balance and activities of daily living  were insufficient to conclude  .  Posterior   AFOs ( solid , hinged , supra-malleolar , dynamic )  increased ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact  ( SMD = 1.65 , P < 0.001 )  and during swing  ( SMD = 1.34 , P  < 0.001 ) , and decreased ankle power generation in stance  ( SMD = –0.72 , P < 0.001 ) in children with equinus gait . Conclusion : In  children with spastic cerebral palsy  , there is strong evidence  that  AFOs induce  small improvements in gait speed  and moderate evidence  that  AFOs have a small to moderate  effect on gross motor function  . In  children with equinus  gait , there is strong evidence that posterior AFOs induce large changes in distal kinematics."
" This paper is consistent with other review s in this area , suggesting that  people with arthritis  receive only marginal benefits from participating in chronic disease  self-management interventions  . When looking at the types of outcomes that trials are based on , however , alternative explanations for these results seem probable . As evaluations heavily rely on patient self-report , current approaches to program evaluation may not be sufficient to assess the intended impact of  self-management education .  An in-depth investigation of the types of outcomes assessed is provided in a separate paper."
"hBACKGROUND In 2011 , the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) published a systematic review on the comparative effectiveness of  disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs )  used to treat  adults with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .  The publication was an up date to a 2007 report . A total of  258 published articles  were used in the AHRQ review to compare the effectiveness of  corticosteroids , and oral and biologic DMARDs  in the treatment of RA . Head-to-head studies and prospect i ve cohort trials were used to compare one drug to another in determining efficacy and effectiveness . AHRQ compiled this report in an attempt to summarize and integrate the available data for clinicians to make evidence based practice decisions for their patients since there is limited consensus among the medical community regarding the comparative effectiveness of drugs used to treat RA . The report reveals there is still much research to be done concerning the side effects of these agents and their influence in different patient subgroups . OBJECTIVES To : ( a ) utilize review findings to make diagnostic and treatment management decisions in clinical practice , ( b ) inform clinicians on the findings from the up date d AHRQ 's 2011 comparative effectiveness review on drug therapy for  RA in adults  , and ( c ) identify shortcomings in the current research and future directions revealed by the report . SUMMARY Rheumatoid arthritis is a major public health burden . The 2011 up date d AHRQ report includes several new medications approved by the FDA since 2007 . The review includes 31 head-to-head r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) , 1 head-to-head nonr and omized controlled trial , 44  placebo controlled trials  , 28 meta-analyses or  systematic  review s , and  107 observational studies  . Most of the studies used for the comparative analysis are of fair quality with an insufficient to moderate strength of evidence assigned to the findings ( Table 1 ) . A mixed treatment comparisons (MTC)meta- analysis from the AHRQ report found that the biologic etanercept has a higher probability of  improvement in disease activity  compared with other biologic DMARDs , but the MTC findings have a low strength of evidence and caution is recommended in the interpretation of this weak evidence . For  patients with early RA  , limited evidence precludes conclusions about the superiority of one combination therapy versus another . The data are also inconclusive for comparisons of  therapeutic similarity  among oral DMARDs including the limitation created by differences inmethotrexate  ( MTX ) dosing  across trials . Extensive clinical experience over the years support the preferred use of MTX in most patients versus other oral DMARDs as well as its use in multidrug regimens , whereas there is little data on the use of  oral DMARDs  in combination with  biologic agents .  The review does not support a specific  biologic DMARD  over another due to the lack of head-to-head trials comparing these agents using vali date d RA outcome measures . The data show that the majority of biologics have approximately the same efficacy except for anakinra , which was found to be less effective . The biologic and oral  DMARDs  are similar in  overall tolerability  , but several studies suggest that  adverse events  are more common with  biologic DMARDs  versus oral  DMARDs .  Based on limited evidence , the oral  DMARDs  do not appear to have an increased risk of  severe adverse events  including  cardiovascular events and cancer .  Although most studies also found no increased  risk of cardiovascular events or cancer  with the  biologic DMARDs  , cohort studies show an increased  risk of heart failure  with  adalimumab , etanercept  , and  infliximab  compared with oral  DMARDs .  The up date d AHRQ review synthesizes the current literature on therapies used for the treatment of  RA in adults .  The investigators are also able to identify pertinent research gaps in the literature that can be addressed with future research."
"nOBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between   maternal  diet  during pregnancy and lactation and development of   atopic disorders  in childhood .  METHODS We included studies published up to August 2011 that assessed  food-based  maternal  dietary interventions  or that examined associations between   maternal dietary intake   during  pregnancy  and /or  lactation  and   allergic outcomes  (  eczema  ,  asthma  ,  hay fever  ,  and sensitization )  in their children .  RESULTS  We included 42 studies ( > 40 000 children ) : 11 intervention studies ( including 7 r and omized control trials ) , 26 prospect i ve cohort studies , 4 retrospective cohort studies , and 1  case-control study . In the r and omized control trials , no significant difference was noted overall in the  prevalence of eczema and asthma  in the offspring of  women on diets  free from common food allergens during pregnancy . The prospect i ve cohorts investigated a large number of potential associations , but reported few significant associations between  maternal dietary intake  and  development of allergy .  Maternal  diets  rich in  fruits and vegetables , fish , and foods containing vitamin D and Mediterranean dietary patterns  were among the few consistent associations with lower risk for allergic disease in their children . Foods associated with higher risk included  vegetable oils  and  margarine , nuts  , and  fast food .   This review did not find widespread or consistent links between  mothers  '  dietary  intake and  atopic outcomes  in their children . However , maternal consumption of  Mediterranean dietary patterns  , diets rich in  fruits and vegetables , fish  , and  vitamin D-containing  foods were suggestive of benefit , requiring further evaluation."
"ePostoperative malnutrition is a major issue among  gastrointestinal cancer patients .  Because n-3  polyunsaturated fatty  acids ( n-3 PUFAs ) have immunological benefits ,  n-3 PUFAs  are widely used in  oral nutritional supplements  ( ONS ) . However ,  n-3 PUFAs  in ONS reduced patients ’ compliance with ONS and affected the role of ONS in maintaining the postoperative nutritional status of patients . The aim of this study was to systematic ally explore the benefits of  enteral nutrition rich in n-3 PUFAs  in maintaining the nutritional status of  patients after gastrointestinal surgery .  Data bases including PubMed , Web of Science , Embase , Cochrane Library , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , Wanfang , and VIP data bases were search ed through March 16 , 2019 . The references of related review s and studies were assessed up to March 16 , 2019 . The effect sizes from individual studies were calculated as the st and ardized  mean difference ( SMD ) , mean difference ( MD )  , and  risk ratio ( RR  ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) .  A total of 11 studies ( n = 977 ) were included .  In this systematic review and meta- analysis , we observed that  enteral supplementation of n-3 PUFAs  had no significant  effect on weight  ( MD , 1.09 ; 95 % CI , −0.90 , 3.08  ) , body mass index  ( MD , 0.55 ; 95 % CI , −1.45 , 2.54  ) , albumin  ( SMD , 0.39 ; 95 % CI , −0.10 , 0.87  ) , wound infections  ( RR , 0.87 , 95 % CI , 0.57 , 1.33 )  , or pneumonia  ( RR , 0.98 ; 95 % CI , 0.60 , 1.59 ) in  gastrointestinal cancer patients .  Thus , compared with  enteral nutritional without n-3 PUFAs , enteral nutritional rich in n-3 PUFAs  has no significant effects  on nutritional status , incidence of pneumonia , or wound infections  among  gastrointestinal cancer patients  during postoperative convalescence."
"yThe combination of economic and social costs associated with non-communicable diseases provide a compelling argument for developing strategies that can influence modifiable risk factors , such as discrete food choices . Models of  behaviour  , such as the  Theory of Planned Behaviour ( TPB )  provide conceptual order that allows program design ers and policy makers to identify the substantive elements that drive behaviour and design effective interventions . The primary aim of the current review was to examine the association between  TPB   variables  and  discrete  food choice behaviours . A systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies . Calculation of the pooled mean effect size ( r+ ) was conducted using inverse-variance weighted , r and om effects meta- analysis . Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the Q- and I2-statistics . Meta-regression was used to test the impact of moderator variables : type of food choice behaviour ;  participants ’ age  and  gender . A total of 42 journal articles and four unpublished dissertations met the inclusion criteria .   TPB  variables were found to have medium to large associations with both  intention and behaviour . Attitudes  had the strongest association with  intention  ( r+ = 0.54 ) followed by  perceived behavioural control  ( PBC , r+ = 0.42 ) and  subjective norm  ( SN , r+ = 0.37 ) . The association  between intention and behaviour  was r+ = 0.45 and between  PBC and behaviour  was r+ = 0.27 . Moderator analyses revealed the complex nature of dietary behaviour and the factors that underpin individual food choices . Significantly higher  PBC-behaviour associations  were found for choosing health compromising compared to health promoting foods . Significantly higher  intention-behaviour and PBC-behaviour associations  were found for choosing health promoting foods compared to avoiding health compromising foods . Participant characteristics were also found to moderate associations within the model . Higher  intention-behaviour associations  were found for  older  , compared to  younger age groups .  The variability in the association of the  TPB  with different food choice behaviours uncovered by the moderator analyses strongly suggest that research ers should carefully consider the nature of the behaviour being exhibited prior to selecting a theory."
"dThe purpose of this systematic review is to assess the evidence behind the dietary requirement of  protein  and to assess the health effects of varying  protein  intake in  healthy elderly persons  in order to evaluate the evidence for an optimal protein intake . The literature search covered year 2000 - 2011 . Prospect i ve cohort , case-control , and intervention studies  of a general healthy population in setting s similar to the Nordic countries with protein intake from food-based sources  were included . Out of a total of  301 abstract s , 152 full papers were identified as potentially relevant .  After careful scrutiny , 23 papers were quality grade d as A ( highest , n=1 ) , B ( n=18 ) , or C ( n=4 ) . The grade of evidence was classified as convincing , probable , suggestive , or inconclusive . The evidence is assessed as : probable for an estimated average requirement ( EAR ) of 0.66 g good- quality protein/kg body weight (BW)/day based on nitrogen balance ( N-balance ) studies and the subsequent recommended dietary allowance ( RDA ) of 0.83 g good- quality protein/kg BW/day representing the minimum dietary protein needs of virtually all healthy elderly persons . Regarding the optimal level of  protein  related to functional outcomes like  maintenance of bone mass , muscle mass , and strength , as well as for morbidity and mortality  , the evidence is ranging from suggestive to inconclusive . Results from particularly prospect i ve cohort studies suggest a  safe intake  of up to at least 1.2 - 1.5 g protein/kg BW/day or approximately 15 - 20 E% . Overall , many of the included prospect i ve cohort studies were difficult to fully evaluate since results mainly were obtained by food frequency question naires that were flawed by underreported intakes , although some studies were ' calibrated ' to correct for under- or over-reporting . In conclusion , the evidence is assessed as probable regarding the EAR based on N-balance studies and suggestive to inconclusive regarding an  optimal protein intake  higher than the estimated RDA assessed from N-balance studies , but an exact level can not be determined . Potentially adverse effects of a protein intake exceeding 20 - 23 E% remain to be investigated."
 . The current data do not support clinical guideline recommendations for administering double-dose vaccination for  patients with CKD  as  seroconversion  was not improved and  seroprotection  was inadequately assessed . Large high- quality studies are required to overcome the current evidence gap regarding vaccine dosing in CKD.
"yIn 2014 , the Food and Drug Administration approved a new  human papillomavirus 9-valent vaccine ( 9vHPV )  , targeting nine HPV types : HPV types 6 , 11 , 16 , and 18 , which are also targeted by the  quadrivalent HPV vaccine ( qHPV )  , plus five additional high cancer risk HPV types ( HPV types 31 , 33 , 45 , 52 , and 58 ) . The aim of the current study was to systematic ally retrieve , qualitatively and quantitatively pool , as well as critically appraise all available evidence on  9vHPV  from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . We conducted a systematic review of the literature on  9vHPV   efficacy , immunogenicity  and safety , as well as a systematic search of registered , completed , and ongoing RCTs . We  retrieved and screened 227 records for eligibility .  A total of 10 publications reported on RCTs ' results on  9vHPV  and were included in the review . Sixteen RCTs on  9vHPV  have been registered on RCT registries . There is evidence that  9vHPV  generated a response to HPV types 6 , 11 , 16 and 18 that was non-inferior  to qHPV  .  Vaccine efficacy  against five additional HPV type-related diseases was directly assessed on  females aged 16 - 26 years  ( risk reduction against high- grade cervical , vulvar or vaginal disease = 96·7 % , 95 % CI 80·9%-99·8  % ) . Bridging efficacy  was demonstrated for males and females aged 9 - 15 years and males aged 16 - 26 years ( the lower bound of the 95 % CIs of both  the geometric mean titer ratio and difference in seroconversion rates  meeting the criteria for non-inferiority for all HPV types ) . Overall  , 9vHPV  has been proved  to be safe and well tolerated  . Other RCTs addressed :  9vHPV  co-administration with other  vaccines  ,  9vHPV  administration in subjects that previously  received qHPV  and 9vHPV   efficacy in regimens containing fewer than three doses . The inclusion of additional HPV types  in 9vHPV  offers great potential to exp and protection against HPV infection . However , the impact  of 9vHPV  on reducing the global burden of HPV-related disease will greatly depend on vaccine uptake , coverage , availability , and affordability."
"eAIMS To analyse the evidence on the  effectiveness , usability and acceptability  of  health technology  in  falls detection and prevention among older adults .  METHODS  Five data bases were  search ed from February  2004  to February  2014  : PubMed , Medline , Embase , Cochrane and CINAHL , with reference lists review ed and research ers contacted for additional articles . The interventions were  health technology tools used for falls detection and prevention  ( e.g.  computers , mobile phones , motion sensors )  . The outcomes were  effectiveness of , and the attitudes of  healthcare staff  towards , health technology  in  preventing falls .  Two review authors independently assessed full texts using modified versions of the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists . RESULTS Full-texts  of 51 out of 7927 articles were examined  and 17 articles accepted following appraisal using Joanna Briggs Institute modified criteria . These were divided into subheadings of  health information technology tool with visual cues  ( n = 2 ) ,  sensors  ( n = 4 ) ,  Webcam  ( n = 1 ) and  electronic medical records  ( n = 3 ) . Three of the seven systematic review s evaluated  sensor technology  alone , whereas the remainder examined multicomponent interventions . There is a lack of research into the  efficacy  of and  staff attitudes  towards health technology in falls detection and prevention . One study found nurses accepted a  health information technology toolkit  with  visual cues  , with a single r and omized controlled trial demonstrating a reduction in  falls rates .  Most studies regarding sensor technology were of low quality and did not find  reduced falls rates or number of falls-related injuries .  There was also mixed response from  healthcare staff  and users regarding the use of sensors , with concerns about  privacy and false alarms .   Video camera  surveillance effectively reduced  falls rates  and was well accepted by nursing staff . However , patients had concerns for their privacy . Electronic medical records have not so far demonstrated a  reduction  in  falls  , with ongoing staff concerns about their  usability .   Good- quality literature regarding the  effectiveness and acceptability  of health  technology  in falls detection and prevention is lacking . Further research into both these fields is vital prior to wider implementation of such tools in clinical practice."
"eOBJECTIVE The purpose of this study is to explore the evidence surrounding  educational videos  for  patients and family caregivers in hospice and palliative care .  We ask three research questions : 1 . What is the evidence for  video interventions  ? 2 . What is the quality of the evidence behind  video interventions  ? 3 . What are the  outcomes  of   video  interventions  ? METHODS The study is a systematic review , following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review s and Meta- Analysis ( PRISMA ) guidelines . Research ers systematic ally search ed five data bases for experimental and observational studies on the evidence supporting  video education  for  hospice and palliative care patients and caregivers , published in 1969 - 2019 .  RESULTS The review identified  31 relevant articles  with  moderate-high  quality of evidence . Most studies were  experimental ( 74 % ) , came from the United States ( 84 % ) and had a mean sample size of 139 participants .  Studies showed that  video interventions  positively affect  preferences of care and advance care planning , provide emotional support , and serve as decision and information aids .   A strong body of evidence has emerged for  video education interventions  in hospice and palliative care . Additional research assessing  video interventions  ' impact on clinical outcomes is needed . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S  Videos  are a promising tool for patient and family education in hospice and palliative care."
"dCancer  patients  are more at risk of being  unemployed  or having  difficulties to return to work ( RTW )  compared to individuals without health concerns , and is thus a major public health issue . The aim of this systematic review is to identify and describe the interventions developed specifically to help  cancer patients  to RTW after treatment . Two research ers independently screened the articles for inclusion and Critical Appraisal Skills Program ( CASP ) checklists were used to assess the methodology of the included studies .  Ten manuscripts  met the inclusion criteria . The type of studies were three quasi-experimental studies , three longitudinal studies , three r and omized  controlled trials  ( RCTs ) and a qualitative study .  RTW  interventions were conducted in or outside the hospital ( n = 6 and 3 respectively ) , or both ( n = 1 ) .  Improvements in RTW  were only observed in quasi-experimental studies . No  improvement in RTW  was noted in RCTs , nor in other measures ( e.g. ,  quality of life , fatigue ) .  Lack of statistically significant improvement does not necessarily reflect reality , but may be attributed to non-adapted research methods . This systematic review underscores the need for research es in the RTW field to reach a consensus on RTW criteria and their assessment . Recommendations to this effect are suggested."
"sBACKGROUND  Intensive care unit nurses  are critical for managing mechanical ventilation .  Continuing education  is essential in building and maintaining nurses ' knowledge and skills , potentially improving patient outcomes . AIMS The aim of this study was to determine whether  continuing education programmes  on  invasive mechanical ventilation  involving  intensive care unit nurses  are effective in improving patient outcomes . METHODS  Five electronic data bases were search ed from 2001 to 2016  using keywords such as mechanical ventilation , nursing and education . Inclusion criteria were   invasive mechanical ventilation continuing education  programmes that involved nurses and measured patient outcomes .  Primary outcomes were  intensive care unit mortality and in-hospital mortality .  Secondary outcomes included  hospital and intensive care unit length of stay , length of intubation , failed weaning trials , re-intubation incidence , ventilation-associated pneumonia rate and lung-protective ventilator strategies .   Studies were excluded if they excluded nurses , patients were ventilated for less than 24 h , the education content focused  on  protocol implementation or oral care exclusively or the outcomes  were  participant satisfaction  . Quality was assessed by two review ers using an education intervention critical appraisal worksheet and a risk of bias assessment tool . Data were extracted independently by two review ers and analysed narratively due to heterogeneity . RESULTS  Twelve studies met  the inclusion criteria for full review : 11 pre- and post-intervention observational and 1 quasi-experimental design . Studies reported statistically significant reductions in  hospital length of stay , length of intubation , ventilator-associated pneumonia rates , failed weaning trials and improvements in lung-protective ventilation compliance .  Non-statistically significant results were reported for  in-hospital and intensive care unit mortality , re-intubation and intensive care unit length of stay .   Limited evidence of the effectiveness of continuing education programmes on  mechanical  ventilation involving  nurses  in improving patient outcomes exists . Comprehensive continuing education is required . RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Well- design ed trials are required to confirm that comprehensive continuing education involving intensive care  nurses  about mechanical ventilation improves patient outcomes."
"sOBJECTIVE To determine whether  people 's  beliefs about their illness , conceptualised by the  common sense model ( CSM )  , can prospect ively predict  adherence  to   self-management  behaviours  ( including ,   attendance , medication , diet and exercise )   in  adults with acute and chronic physical illnesses .  DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Electronic data bases were search ed in September 2014 , for papers specifying the use of the  ' CSM '  in relation to  ' self-management '  ,  '  rehabilitation  '  and  '  adherence ' in the context of physical illness .  Six hundred abstract s emerged .  Data from  52 relevant studies were extracted  .  Twenty-one studies  were meta-analysed , using correlation coefficients in r and om effects models . The remainder were descriptively synthesis ed . RESULTS The  effect sizes for individual illness belief domains and adherence to self-management behaviours  ranged from .04 to .13 , indicating very weak , predictive relationships . Further analysis revealed that predictive relationships did not differ by the  : type of self-management behaviour ; acute or chronic illness ; or duration of follow-up .   Individual illness belief domains , outlined by the CSM , did not predict  adherence to self-management behaviours  in  adults with physical illnesses .  Prospect i ve relationships , controlling for past behaviour , also did not emerge . Other factors , including  patients '  treatment beliefs and inter-relationships between individual illness beliefs domains , may have influenced potential associations with adherence to  self-management  behaviours."
"nActivities running in community-based- setting s offer a method of delivering  multimodal interventions  to  older adults  beyond  cognitive training programmes .  This systematic review and meta- analysis investigated the impact of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) of  ' real-world ' interventions  on the cognitive abilities  of healthy older adults .  Data base search es were performed between October 2016 and September 2018 .  Forty-three RCTs were eligible for inclusion with 2826 intervention participants and 2234 controls .  Interventions to enhance  cognitive ability  consisted of  participation in activities  that were  physical  ( 25 studies ) ,  cognitive  ( 9 studies ) , or mixed ( i.e. ,  physical and cognitive ;  7 studies ) , and two studies used other interventions that included older adults assisting schoolchildren and engagement via social network sites . Meta- analysis revealed that  Trail Making Test ( TMT ) A  , p = 0.05 , M = 0.43 , 95 % CI [ -0.00 , 0.86 ] ,  digit symbol substitution  , p = 0.05 , M = 0.30 , 95 % CI [ 0.00 , 0.59 ] , and  verbal fluency  , p = 0.04 , M = 0.31 , 95 % CI [ 0.02 , 0.61 ] , improved after specific types of interventions versus the control groups ( which were either active , wait-list or passive controls ) . When comparing  physical activity interventions  against all control groups ,  TMT  A , p = 0.04 , M = 0.25 , 95 % CI [ 0.01 , 0.48 ] , and  digit span forward  , p = 0.05 , M = 0.91 , 95 % CI [ -0.00 , 1.82 ] , significantly improved . Results remained non-significant for all outcomes when comparing  cognitive activity interventions  against all control groups . Results therefore suggest that healthy older adults are more likely to see  cognitive improvements  when involved in physical activity interventions . In addition ,  TMT  A was the only measure that consistently showed significant improvements following physical activity interventions .  Visuospatial abilities  ( as measured by TMT A ) may be more susceptible to improvement following  physical activity-based interventions  , and TMT A may be a useful tool for detecting differences in that domain."
" Given the high burden of death among  children younger than five years of age in low and middle income countries  , and the fact that mortality in infancy is a major contributory cause , it is critical to obtain sound scientific evidence of the effect of  vitamin A supplementation  during the neonatal period on infant mortality and morbidity . Evidence provided in this review does not indicate a potential beneficial effect of  vitamin A supplementation  among neonates at birth in reducing mortality during the first six months or 12 months of life . Given this finding and the absence of a clear indication of the biological mechanism through which vitamin A could affect mortality , along with substantial conflicting findings from individual studies conducted in setting s with potentially varying levels of maternal vitamin A deficiency and infant mortality , absence of follow-up studies assessing any long-term impact of a bulging fontanelle after supplementation and the finding of a potentially harmful effect among  female infants  , additional research is warranted before a decision can be reached regarding policy recommendations for this intervention."
" This review found a significant decrease in  length of stay  in  preterm infants receiving a  NNS  intervention .  The review did not reveal a consistent benefit of NNS with respect to other major clinical  variables ( weight gain , energy intake , heart rate , oxygen saturation , intestinal transit time , age at full oral feeds and behavioral state )  . The review identified other positive clinical outcomes of NNS : transition from tube to bottle feeds and  better bottle feeding performance .  No negative outcomes were reported in any of the studies . There were also a number of limitations of the presently available evidence related to the design of the studies , outcome variability , and lack of long-term data . Based on the available evidence ,  NNS  in preterm infants would appear to have some clinical benefit . It does not appear to have any short-term negative effects . In view of the fact that there are no long-term data , further investigations are recommended . In order to facilitate meta- analysis of these data , future research in this area should involve outcome measures consistent with those used in previous studies . In addition , published reports should include all relevant data."
" ICS were superior to SCG on  measures of lung function and asthma control  for both  adults and children with chronic asthma .  There were few studies reporting on  quality of life and health care utilization  , which limited our ability to adequately evaluate the relative effects of these medications on a broader range of outcomes . Although there were no differences in  adverse effects  between  ICS  and  SCG  , most trials were short and may not have been of sufficient duration to identify long-term effects . Our results support recent consensus statements in the U.S. and elsewhere that favour the use of  ICS  over  SCG  for control of persistent asthma."
"  5-ASA  was superior to  placebo  for maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis . However ,  5-ASA  had a statistically significant  therapeutic inferiority  relative to SASP . Oral  5-ASA  administered once daily is as  effective and safe  as conventional dosing for maintenance of remission in quiescent ulcerative colitis . There does not appear to be any difference in  efficacy or safety  between the various formulations of  5-ASA .   Patients with extensive ulcerative colitis or with frequent relapses  may benefit from a higher dose of maintenance therapy . High dose therapy appears to be as  safe  as low dose and is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events."
"yHuman papillomavirus ( HPV ) types cause approximately 70 % of cervical cancer worldwide . Two vaccines have been recently evaluated in r and omized controlled trials :  the bivalent vaccine for HPV 16 and 18  ( Cervarix , GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium ) and  the quadrivalent vaccine for HPV 6 , 11 , 16 , and 18  (  Gardasil  , Merck and Co , Inc , Whitehouse Station , NJ ) . We have performed a systematic review of all r and omized controlled trials in which  vaccines against HPV  were compared with  placebo  regarding efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity .  Six studies met the inclusion criteria , which included 47,236 women .  The first objective in this systematic review was to assess  vaccine efficacy  in the prevention of cytologically and /or histologically proven lesions . And the secondary objective was the evaluation of  safety and vaccine immunogenicity .  Bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines significantly reduced the  rate of lesions in the cervix , vulva , vagina , and anogenital region  , with  efficacy  of 93 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 87 - 96 ) and 62 % ( 95 % CI , 27 - 70 ) , respectively , when compared with the control groups according to intention to treat . Regarding  safety  , we found more  symptoms  in the bivalent vaccine group ( 35 % ; 95 % CI , 5 - 73 ) when compared with the control groups . In regard to  vaccine immunogenicity  , there was  seroconversion  in the group that received the vaccine when compared with the placebo group in the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines . Prophylactic vaccination can prevent HPV infection in  women aged 9 to  26  years  not previously  infected  with the  HPV subtypes  covered by the  vaccines  . To evaluate cervical cancer incidence and mortality , a longer follow-up is necessary."
 Increased waiting time from surgery to initiation of  adjuvant chemotherapy  is associated  with a significant decrease in survival  . Avoidance of unnecessary delays in the initiation of  adjuvant chemotherapy  has the potential to save the lives of many women with breast cancer.
"dBackground Sepsis is a global major health problem with high mortality rates . More effective therapy is needed for treating sepsis .  Acupuncture  has been used for various diseases , including  severe infection  , in  China  for more than 2,000 years . Previous studies reported that  acupuncture at Zusanli ( ST36 )  might be effective in treating sepsis , but the efficacy and the quality of evidence remain unclear since there is no systematic review on acupuncture at ST36 for sepsis . Methods  Seven data bases were search ed from the inception of each data base up to May 2019 .  Ultimately ,  54 studies using  acupuncture at ST36  for the treatment of experimental sepsis were identified in both English and Chinese literature  with systematic review procedures . Results  Acupuncture  might be useful in  reducing injuries induced by sepsis in cardiac , lung , kidney , liver , gastrointestinal tract , and immune system .  Its potential mechanisms for antisepsis might include  reducing oxidative stress and inflammation , improving microcirculatory disturbance , and maintaining the immune balance  mediated by dopamine . However , the positive findings should be interpreted with caution due to poor method ological quality and publication bias . Conclusion  Acupuncture at ST36  might be a promising complementary strategy for controlling  sepsis inflammation  , yet further studies are needed."
"sData from observational studies suggest that nasal obstruction contributes to the pathogenesis of   snoring  and  obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) .   To define more accurately the relationship between snoring , OSA and nasal obstruction , the current authors have summarised the literature on epidemiological and physiological studies , and performed a systematic review of r and omised controlled trials in which the effects of treating nasal obstruction on  snoring and OSA  were investigated . Search es of bibliographical data bases revealed nine trials with r and omised controlled design .  External nasal dilators  were used in five studies ,  topically applied steroids  in one ,  nasal decongestants  in two , and  surgical treatment  in one study . Data from studies using nasal dilators , intranasal steroids and decongestants to relieve nasal congestion showed beneficial effects on  sleep architecture  , but only minor improvement of  OSA symptoms or severity . Snoring  seemed to be reduced by nasal  dilators  .  Nasal  surgery   also had minimal impact on  OSA symptoms .  In conclusion , chronic nasal obstruction seems to play a minor role in the pathogenesis of   obstructive sleep apnoea   , and seems to be of some relevance in the origin of snoring . The impact of treating nasal obstruction in  patients with  snoring  and  obstructive sleep apnoea   on long-term outcome remains to be defined through r and omised controlled trials of medical and surgical therapies."
" All the nutritional interventions review ed had the potential to decrease  stunting  , based on evidence from outside of slum context s ; however , there was no evidence of an effect of the interventions included in this review ( very low- to moderate-certainty evidence ) . Challenges linked to urban slum programming ( high mobility , lack of social services , and high loss of follow-up ) should be taken into account when nutrition-specific interventions are proposed to address  LBW and stunting  in such environments . More evidence is needed of the effects of multi-sectorial interventions , combining nutrition-specific and sensitive methods and programmes , as well as the effects of ' up-stream ' practice s and policies of governmental , non-governmental organisations , and the business sector on nutrition-related outcomes such as stunting."
"eRelapsed  germ cell tumor ( GCT )  is a highly curable cancer with  st and ard-dose platinum-based chemotherapy ( CT ) ;  however ,  high-dose CT ( HDCT )  is seldom used as salvage therapy instead or after conventional CT . We conducted a systematic review of published trials to compare outcomes between  st and ard-dose CT and HDCT  in  patients with relapsed GCT after first-line therapy for advanced disease .  A literature search was carried out in multiple electronic data bases ( PubMed , Embase , Scopus , Web of Science , and The Cochrane Library ) , and studies reporting salvage treatment of  relapsed GCT  with   st and ard-dose  or carboplatin – etoposide-based HDCT  were selected .  Overall response rate , median overall survival ( OS ) , and the 1- , 2- , 3- , and 5-year OS rates  were pooled , and the significance of difference between arms was assessed with a Chi-square test .  Twenty-nine  st  and  ard-dose  and 31 HD studies were included in the meta- analysis  .  For st and ard-dose CT  versus  HDCT  , there was no significant difference in  median OS  ( 14.8 months and 24.09 months , respectively ; P = 0.09 ) or in  1- , 2- , 3- , or 5-year survival rate   ( st and ard-dose CT  , 64.2 , 63.6 , 45.1 , and 43 % , respectively ;  HDCT  , 63.7 , 51.2 , 46.7 , and 45 % , respectively ; P = 0.9 , P = 0.4 , P = 0.75 , and P = 0.06 ) .  Conventional dose regimens and HDCT  were associated with comparable  efficacy  when used as salvage therapies in relapsed GCTs as second-line therapy or beyond . However , the selection of ideal c and i date s for more or less intensive treatments deserves further research in the near future."
"nCONTEXT Malnutrition in  pediatric cancer  is common worldwide , yet its prevalence and effects on clinical outcomes remain unclear . OBJECTIVE The aim of this review was to evaluate primary research reporting the prevalence of malnutrition in  pediatric cancer patients  and to assess the effects of  pediatric cancer  and its treatment on nutritional status . DATA SOURCES Electronic data bases of MEDLINE , CINHAL , and PubMed were search ed ( January 1990-February 2013 ) . STUDY SELECTION  Studies of patients aged < 18 years who were diagnosed with and treated for cancer and for whom measurements of anthropometry were reported and  included . The primary outcome was the  prevalence of malnutrition ( undernutrition and overnutrition ) , expressed as body mass index ( BMI )  , in  children diagnosed with and treated for cancer .  DATA EXTRACTION Evidence was appraised critically by employing the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool , and data was extracted from original articles . DATA SYNTHESIS  A total of 46 studies were included  , most of which were considered to be of low quality on the basis of heterogeneity in both the criteria and the measurements used to define malnutrition .  Undernutrition  was identified by  measuring BMI , weight loss , mid-upper arm circumference , and triceps skinfold thickness  , while  overnutrition  was assessed using  BMI .  Overall , the prevalence of  undernutrition  ranged from 0 % to 65 % and  overnutrition  from 8 % to 78 % . Finally ,  undernutrition  in pediatric cancer at diagnosis was associated with  poor clinical outcomes  in 6 of 9 studies .  The possibility of a high prevalence of malnutrition in  childhood cancer  , indicated by the studies review ed , highlights the need for high- quality , population -based , longitudinal studies using st and ard criteria to identify malnutrition."
 Few studies tested predictability of the  TPB  in  population s  with  or at-risk of diabetes .  This review highlighted differences in the predictive utility of the  TPB  suggesting that the model is behaviour and population specific . Findings on key determinants of specific behaviours contribute to a better underst and ing of mechanisms of behaviour change and are useful in design ing targeted behavioural interventions for different diabetes population.
"dA systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the following interventions for prevention of   aspiration pneumonia ( AP )  in older adults :   compensatory strategy /positioning changes , dietary interventions , pharmacologic therapies , oral hygiene , and tube feeding .  Data sources included a key word search of the MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , CINAHL , and HealthSTAR data bases and h and search es of  six journals  . Reference lists of relevant primary and review articles were search ed . Studies included were  r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) enrolling adults aged 65 and older at risk of and assessed for AP .  Two investigators extracted data on population , intervention , outcomes , and method ological quality . Of the  17 identified RCTs  , eight met the selection criteria , two addressed  dietary management or compensatory swallowing  , two assessed  pharmacological therapies  , one assessed  oral hygiene  , and three assessed  tube feeding .  None of the eight trials reported use of blinding , and allocation concealment was unclear in five . Use of  amantadine   prevented pneumonia  in one trial of  nursing home residents .  The antithrombotic agent  cilostazol   prevented AP  in another trial but result ed in  excessive bleeding .  Insufficient data exist to determine the  effectiveness of positioning strategies , modified diets , oral hygiene , feeding tube placement , or delivery of food  in  preventing AP .  Considering how common the problem of AP is in older adults , larger , high- quality RCTs on the effectiveness of preventive interventions are warranted."
"hObjective The aim was to investigate whether  coffee or caffeine consumption  is associated with  reproductive  endpoints among  women with natural fertility ( ie  ,  time to pregnancy [ TTP ] and spontaneous abortion [ SAB ] ) and among women in fertility treatment ( ie , clinical pregnancy rate or live birth rate ) .  Design This study was a systematic review and dose – response meta- analysis including data from case – control and cohort studies . Methods An extensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase , with no time and language restrictions . Also , reference lists were search ed manually . Two independent review ers assessed the manuscript quality using the Newcastle – Ottawa Scale ( NOS ) . A two-stage dose – response meta- analysis was applied to assess a potential association between  coffee/caffeine  consumption and the  outcomes : TTP , SAB , clinical pregnancy , and live birth .  Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochrane Q-test and I2 statistics . Publication bias was assessed using Egger ’s regression test . Results The pooled results showed that  coffee/caffeine  consumption is associated with a significantly increased  risk of SAB  for 300 mg caffeine/day ( relative risk [ RR ] : 1.37 , 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] : 1.19 ; 1.57 ) and for 600 mg caffeine/day ( RR : 2.32 , 95 % CI : 1.62 ; 3.31 ) . No association was found between  coffee/caffeine  consumption  and outcomes of fertility treatment  ( based on two studies ) . No clear association was found between exposure to  coffee/caffeine  and  natural fertility  as measured by  fecundability odds ratio  ( based on three studies ) or  waiting TTP  ( based on two studies ) . Conclusion Results from this meta- analysis support the growing evidence of an association between  coffee/caffeine  intake and the  risk of SAB .  However , viewing the reproductive capacity in a broader perspective , there seems to be little , if any , association between  coffee/caffeine  consumption and  fecundity .  In general , results from this study are supportive of a pre caution ary principle advised by health organizations such as European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) and World Health Organization ( WHO ) , although the advised limit of a maximum of two to three cups of coffee/200–300 mg caffeine per day may be too high."
"tOBJECTIVE The relative differences in effectiveness of  subchondral stimulation , osteochondral grafts  , and  autologous chondrocyte implantation ( ACI )  are still unclear . It is the objective of this study to systematic ally review the literature on  ACI  compared to other treatments by clinical outcome and the quality of the repair tissue , including an assessment of the validity of these findings . METHOD The online data bases PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Controlled Trial Register , CENTRAL , CINAHL , and BioMed were search ed . Controlled trials comparing  ACI with other methods of cartilage repair  or  placebo  were included . Data on  clinical  outcome and the quality  of the repair  tissue was abstract ed in duplicate . Study validity was assessed by individual components ( r and omization , blinded outcome assessment , sample size , attrition , percentage biopsies ) . RESULTS  Nine studies were included .  The  internal validity  of most of these studies was poor . Studies comparing  ACI  with  subchondral stimulation  have a higher quality and show  no differences  in  clinical outcomes  , but suggest better  results  in  tissue quality .  The high quality evidence comparing  ACI  with  osteochondral grafts  shows better  clinical outcomes and higher tissue quality  after  ACI .   Among the included studies there is much inconsistency in method ological quality and findings . Regardless of these problems , the absolute differences between groups are fairly small , thus raising questions about their clinical importance . Future studies will be needed to answer the question of benefits of  ACI  compared to other treatments , and could profit from addressing and avoiding the problems seen in this group . Finally conclusions concerning  long-term effects  are still difficult."
"tNon-invasive  ventilation ( NIV )  has been widely supported in the past two decades as an effective application in avoiding the need for  endotracheal intubation  ( ETI ) and reducing associated mortality in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ( AHRF ) patients . However , the efficacy of  NIV  in  AHRF patients , non-related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and trauma  is still controversial in the field of medical research . This retrospective study aim ed to evaluate the efficacy of  NIV  as an adjunctive therapy in  non- COPD and non-traumatic AHRF patients .  Data of  11 r and omized control trials  (  RCTs )  , which were conducted  between 1990 and 2010  to determine the efficacy of  NIV   in non- COPD and non-traumatic AHRF patients  , were review ed from the PUBMED , MEDLINE , Cochrane Library , and EMBASE data bases . Parameters monitored in this study included the  ETI rate , fatal complications , mortality rate of patients , and their ICU and hospital duration of stay .  Overall results showed a statistically significant decrease in the  rate of ETI , mortality , and fatal complications  along with  reduced ICU and hospital length of stay  in non- COPD and non-trauma AHRF patients of various etiologies . This systematic review suggests that  non- COPD and non-trauma AHRF patients  can potentially benefit from  NIV  as compared with conventional treatment methods . Observations from various cohort studies , observational studies , and previously published literature advocate on the efficacy of  NIV  for treating  non- COPD and non-traumatic AHRF patients .  However , considering the diversity of studied population s , further studies and more specific trials on less  heterogeneous AHRF patient groups  are needed to focus on this aspect."
" The currently available data provide little information about the  effectiveness of yoga interventions  for  people suffering from haematological malignancies .  The finding  that yoga  may be beneficial  for the patients ' quality of sleep  is based on a very small body of evidence . Therefore , the role  of yoga  as an additional therapy for haematological malignancies remains unclear . Further high- quality r and omised controlled trials with larger numbers of participants are needed to make a definitive statement."
" Despite the significant effect noted in the studies , we concluded that there are not enough data to evaluate the effect of vaccination on coronary heart disease."
 This review demonstrates the lack of strong evidence to determine the most optimal methods of nutrition support prior to UGI cancer resection . Current surgical oncology guidelines should be utilised until further research from high quality trials enable the development of specific clinical practice guidelines.
 the studies included in this review provide evidence for the positive effects of  VR  in elderly and middle-aged adults with vestibular disturbances.
"yAdjuvanted-influenza  vaccination  is an efficient method for enhancing the  immunogenicity  of influenza split-virus vaccines for preventing influenza . However , the medical community 's underst and ing of its performance in  patients infected with HIV  remains limited . To identify the advantages , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis with r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and cohort and case-control studies that have the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  influenza vaccines  in  patients infected with HIV  as outcomes . We search ed six  different data  bases , and  1698 patients infected with HIV in 11 studies were included .  Statistical analysis was performed to calculate the  pooled st and ardized mean differences ( SMD ) or relative risk ( RR ) and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) .  Regarding  immunogenicity  , the  pooled SMD of GMT ( Geometric mean titer )  for A/H1N1 was 0.61 ( 95%CI ( 0.40,0.82 ) ) , the  pooled RR of seroconversion  was 1.34 ( 95%CI ( 0.91,1.98 ) ) for the H1N1 vaccine , 1.27(95%CI ( 0.64,2.52 ) ) for the H3N2 vaccine , 1.19(95%CI ( 0.97,1.46 ) ) for the B-type influenza vaccine . The  pooled RR of seroprotection  was 1.61 ( 95%CI ( 1.00,2.58 ) ) for the H1N1 vaccine , 1.06 ( 95%CI(0.83,1.35 ) ) for the H3N2 vaccine , and 1.13(95%CI(0.91,1.41 ) ) for the B-type vaccine .  Adjuvanted-influenza vaccination  showed  good general tolerability  in  patients infected with HIV  , with the only significant increase being the  rate of local pain at the injection site  ( RR = 2.03 , 95%CI ( 1.06,3.86 ) ) . In conclusion , all studies evaluating  injected adjuvanted influenza vaccination  among  patients infected with HIV  showed acceptable levels of safety and immunogenicity."
"sThe European micronutrient recommendations aligned ( EURRECA ) Network of Excellence seeks to establish clear guidelines for assessing the validity of reported  micronutrient  intakes among  vulnerable population groups .  A systematic literature review identified studies validating the methodology used in  elderly people  for measuring usual dietary  micronutrient  intake . The quality of each validation study selected was assessed using a EURRECA-developed scoring system . The validation studies were categorised according to whether the reference method applied reflected short-term intake ( < 7 d ) , long-term intake ( > or = 7 d ) or used biomarkers ( BM ) . A correlation coefficient for each micronutrient was calculated from the mean of the correlation coefficients from each study weighted by the quality of the study .  Thirty-three papers were selected  , which included the validation of twenty-five  different FFQ  ,  six diet histories ( DH )  ,  one 24-h recall ( 24HR  ) and a  videotaped dietary assessment method .  A total of five publications analysed BM , which were used to vali date four FFQ , and one 24HR , presenting very good correlations only for vitamin E. The analysis of weighted correlation coefficients classified by FFQ or DH showed that most of the micronutrients had higher correlations when the DH was used as the dietary method . Comparing only FFQ results showed very good correlations for measuring  short-term intakes of riboflavin and thiamin  and  long-term intakes of P and Mg .  When frequency methods are used for assessing micronutrient intake , the inclusion of  dietary supplements  improves their reliability for most micronutrients."
"hAIM The aim of this paper is to summarise and critically evaluate the evidence available from controlled clinical trials regarding the use of  guided imagery  as a sole adjuvant therapy for  cancer patients .  METHODS Electronic search es for controlled clinical trials were carried out in  eight data bases  and two clinical trial registers . Trials that featured  guided imagery as a sole adjuvant therapy  were included . No language restrictions were imposed . Data were extracted and vali date d independently by two research ers . RESULTS  Six r and omised clinical trials were included  . Detailed results were available for four studies only . Poor reporting and heterogeneous population s , interventions and outcome measures across trials precluded statistical pooling of results . The method ological quality was on average low . Three studies reported significant differences in  measures  of  anxiety , comfort or emotional response  to chemotherapy for patients who received  guided imagery  over the control groups . Two studies showed no differences between guided imagery and other interventions in any of the outcome measures .   Guided imagery  , as a sole adjuvant cancer therapy may be psycho-supportive and increase  comfort .  There is no compelling evidence to suggest positive effects on physical  symptoms  such as  nausea and vomiting .  The data seem sufficiently encouraging for the use of  guided imagery  as an adjuvant cancer therapy to merit further research."
" Overall , there is a lack of good- quality primary studies , and existing interventions are suboptimal . The inclusion of additional BCTs , including those to target efficacy appraisal s , could increase intervention effectiveness . The protocol ( CRD42015029365 ) is available from http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ PROSPERO /. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject ? Previous research indicates that an increase in   risk appraisal   is associated with increased uptake in health-related behaviours . Research suggests that interventions  increasing risk appraisal  have a greater effect on  intention  when elements of efficacy appraisal s are simultaneously increased . What does this study add ? This is the first systematic review to examine the effect of interventions on  risk appraisal and vaccination uptake  using only experimental studies . Limitations of the interventions themselves , and those caused by study methods and reporting , mean that the potential value of this type of review is lost . Instead , its value is in shining a light on the paucity of experimental studies in this area , and the quality of methods and reporting used . Future experimental studies should examine interventions that focus exclusively on  increasing risk and efficacy appraisal  compared to  controls  , use conditional measures of risk , and improve reporting to enable both more accurate coding of intervention content and more accurate assessment s of study bias."
" The economic analysis agrees with the conclusions from the previous models , in that biologics are shown to be  cost-effective  for treating  patients with active PsA  compared with the conventional management strategy . In  particular ,  etanercept is cost-effective compared with the other biologic treatments."

"8BACKGROUND The  omega-3 ( n-3 ) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )  has proven effective at reducing fat storage in animal studies . However , a systematic review of human trials showed a lack of quality data to support or refute this hypothesis . OBJECTIVE We sought to determine whether maternal  DHA  supplementation during the second half of pregnancy results in a lower  body mass index ( BMI )  and  percentage of body fat   in children .  DESIGN We conducted a follow-up at 3 and 5 y of age  of children who were born to mothers enrolled in the DOMInO ( DHA to Optimize Mother Infant Outcome ) double-blind , r and omized controlled trial  , in which  women with a singleton pregnancy  were provided with  DHA-rich fish-oil capsules  ( 800 mg  DHA/d  )  or vegetable-oil capsules ( control group )  in the second half of pregnancy . Primary outcomes were  the BMI z score and percentage of body fat  at 3 and 5  y  of  age  . Potential interactions between prenatal DHA and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPARγ ) genotype as a measure of the genetic predisposition to obesity were investigated . RESULTS  A total of 1614 children were eligible for the follow-up .  Parent or caregiver consent was obtained for  1531 children  ( 95  %  ) , and these children were included in the  analysis . BMI z scores and percentages of body fat of children  in the DHA group did not differ from those of children in the control group at either 3 y of age  [  BMI z score adjusted mean difference : 0.03 ( 95 % CI : -0.07 , 0.13 ; P = 0.61 ) ;  percentage of body fat  adjusted mean difference : -0.26 ( 95 % CI : -0.99 , 0.46 ; P = 0.47 ) ] or 5 y of age  [  BMI z score adjusted mean difference : 0.02 ( 95 % CI : -0.08 , 0.12 ; P = 0.66 ) ;  percentage of body fat  adjusted mean difference : 0.11 ( 95 % CI : -0.60 , 0.82 ; P = 0.75 ) ] . No treatment effects were modified by the PPARγ genotype of the child .  Independent of a genetic predisposition to obesity , maternal intake  of DHA-rich fish oil  during the second half of pregnancy does not affect the  growth or body composition  of children at 3 or 5 y of age . This trial was registered at www.anzctr.org.au as ACTRN1260500056906 and ACTRN12611001127998."
" Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy  is an established st and ard , improving  overall survival  in MIBC .  Pathologic complete response  appears to be an intermediate surrogate for survival , but this finding requires further validation . Definitive data to support  adjuvant chemotherapy  do not exist , and there are no data to support  perioperative therapy  in  cisplatin-ineligible patients .  Utilization of  neoadjuvant cisplatin  is low , attributable in part to patient/physician choice and the advanced age  of patients  ,  who often have multiple comorbidities  including  renal and /or  cardiac dysfunction . Trials are using the  neoadjuvant  paradigm to detect incremental  pathologic response  to  chemobiologic  regimens and brief  neoadjuvant single-agent therapy  to screen for the biologic activity of agents."
" It appears , from the limited number of studies performed , that inactivated vaccine may reduce exacerbations in COPD patients . The size of effect was similar to that seen in large observational studies , and was due to a reduction in exacerbations occurring three or more weeks after vaccination . In  elderly , high risk patients  there was an increase in  adverse effects  with vaccination , but these are seen early and are usually mild and transient."
"yINTRODUCTION  Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC )  is often diagnosed at later stages when treatment options are limited .  Maintenance therapy  may prolong the time to disease progression and potentially increase overall  survival .  Secondarily , it may increase the proportion of patients eligible for second-line therapy at the time of progression . The objective of this systematic review was to examine the use of  systemic treatment  in the maintenance of  patients with NSCLC .  METHODS MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library were search ed for phase III r and omized controlled trials comparing  maintenance systemic treatment against another systemic treatment or placebo  in  patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who had received a minimum of four prior cycles of  platinum-based chemotherapy .   Meta-analyses were conducted with clinical ly homogenous trials . RESULTS  Fourteen r and omized controlled trials with 22 publications were included  . The  overall survival benefit  was strongest for maintenance therapy with  pemetrexed  for  patients with nonsquamous NSCLC  ( hazard ratio = 0.74 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.64 - 0.86 ) but not significant for  patients with squamous NSCLC .  There was also an  overall survival benefit  with maintenance therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors , but the magnitude of the benefit was smaller than with  pemetrexed  ( hazard ratio = 0.84 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.75 - 0.94 ) .  Docetaxel or gemcitabine  as maintenance chemotherapies did not have an impact on  overall survival .   For  patients with advanced , stable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC  whose disease has not  progressed  after four to six  cycles of  platinum-based chemotherapy   , the  overall survival benefits  were strongest for  pemetrexed maintenance therapy  followed by  epidermal  growth factor  receptor tyrosine kinase  inhibitor maintenance therapy."
"nBACKGROUND  Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  has been shown to improve  survival outcomes  in  muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients .  We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to provide up date d results of previous findings . We also summarized published data to compare clinical outcomes of  methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , and cisplatin ( MVAC ) versus gemcitabine and cisplatin/carboplatin ( GC )  in the neoadjuvant setting . METHODS A  meta- analysis of 15 r and omized clinical trials was performed  to compare  neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus local treatment  with  the same local treatment alone .  Because no r and omized trials have investigated  MVAC  versus  GC  in the neoadjuvant setting , a meta- analysis of  13 retrospective studies  was performed to compare  MVAC  with  GC .  RESULTS  A total of 3,285 patients were included in 15 r and omized clinical trials .  There was a significant  overall survival ( OS )  benefit associated with  cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.87 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.79 - 0.96 ) .  A total of 1,766 patients were included in 13 retrospective studies .  There was no significant difference in  pathological complete response  between  MVAC  and  GC .  However ,  GC  was associated with a significantly reduced  overall survival  ( HR , 1.26 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 - 1.57 ) . After excluding carboplatin data ,  GC  still seemed to be inferior to  MVAC  in  OS  ( HR , 1.31 ; 95 % CI , 0.99 - 1.74 ) , but the difference was no longer statistically significant .  These results support the use of  cisplatin-based combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy  in  muscle-invasive  bladder  cancer  . Although  GC  and  MVAC  had similar treatment response rates , the different survival outcome observed in this study requires further investigation . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE  Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  ( NCT ) has been shown to improve  survival outcomes  in muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) patients , but the optimal neoadjuvant regimen has not been established .  Methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin , and cisplatin ( MVAC ) and gemcitabine and cisplatin/carboplatin ( GC )  are two of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in modern oncology . In this two-step meta- analysis , an up date d and more precise estimate of the survival benefit of cisplatin-based NCT in MIBC is provided . This study also demonstrated that  MVAC  might have superior  overall  survival compared with  GC  ( with or without carboplatin data ) in the neoadjuvant setting . The findings suggest that NCT should be st and ard care in MIBC , and MVAC could be the preferred neoadjuvant regimen."
")Background The therapeutic role of  methotrexate ( MTX )  for management of  inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD )  remains unclear . Methods We systematic ally review ed r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) of  MTX  for induction and  maintenance of remission in IBD until January 2020  in accordance with PROSPERO protocol ( # CRD42018115047 ) .  Relative risk ( RR ) of maintenance of remission , induction of remission , endoscopic disease activity , and adverse events  were combined in a meta- analysis . Findings  MTX  monotherapy was not superior to  placebo  for induction of clinical remission in Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . However ,  MTX  was superior to  placebo  in maintaining clinical remission of CD . Concomitant therapy with  MTX  and the TNF inhibitor  infliximab  ( IFX ) was not superior to IFX monotherapy in CD . In ulcerative colitis ( UC ) ,  MTX  monotherapy was not superior to  placebo  neither for induction of clinical remission , nor for maintenance of clinical remission .  MTX  did not result in  superior endoscopic outcomes  during induction or maintenance therapy compared with  placebo .  Regarding  adverse events ( AEs )  , our meta- analysis on CD studies showed a significantly  higher risk of AEs  when comparing  MTX  versus  placebo  in studies investigating induction of remission , but not in maintenance of remission . In UC , no such differences in  AEs  between  MTX  or placebo were observed . Interpretation Current data support the efficacy of parenteral  MTX  monotherapy for maintenance of clinical remission in CD .  MTX  is not confirmed to be effective for treatment of UC or for induction of remission in CD . No evidence supports concomitant  MTX  to improve efficacy of IFX ( no other biologics investigated )."
"dThe aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to assess the efficacy on an intervention on  breastfeeding self-efficacy  and perceived insufficient milk supply outcomes . The literature search was conducted among 6 data bases ( CINAHL , Medline , PsyncInfo , Scopus , Cochrane , and ProQuest ) in between January 2000 to June 2016 . Two review ers independently assessed the articles for the following inclusion criteria : experimental or quasi-experimental studies  ; healthy pregnant women participants intending to breastfeed or healthy breastfeeding women who gave birth to a term singleton and healthy baby ;  intervention administered could have been  educational , support , psycho-social , or breastfeeding self-efficacy based , offered in prenatal or postnatal or both , in person , over the phone , or with the support of e-technologies ;  breastfeeding self-efficacy or perceived insufficient milk supply as outcomes .  Seventeen studies were included in this review ; 12 were r and omized controlled trials .  Most interventions were  self-efficacy  based provided on 1-to-1 format . Meta- analysis of RCTs revealed that interventions significantly improved  breastfeeding self-efficacy  during the first 4 to 6 weeks ( SMD = 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.11 - 0.69 , p = 0.006 ) . This further impact exclusive  breastfeeding  duration . Only 1 study reported data on  perceived insufficient milk supply .   Women who have made the choice to breastfeed  should be offered   breastfeeding self-efficacy-based  interventions  during the perinatal period . Although significant effect of the interventions in  improving maternal breastfeeding self-efficacy  was revealed by this review , there is still a paucity of evidence on the mode , format , and intensity of interventions . Research on the modalities of  breastfeeding self-efficacy  should be pursued."

"yLymphoma etiology remains ill-defined , but immune factors seem to play a major role . The  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine  , a non-specific stimulator of the cellular immune response , could influence  lymphoma risk .  Previous studies addressing this issue showed conflicting results . In this study , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to synthesize the epidemiological evidence . We conducted a systematic search of all  relevant  articles in PubMed  , Embase , Library and Archives Canada , and Cochrane data bases , up to November 1st 2018 . A total of 11 studies were included .  Each study was summarized , method ological quality was assessed by independent evaluators , and a consensus score was generated .  Heterogeneity and publication bias  were evaluated .  Summary odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs )  were estimated separately for Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) and non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) by either a fixed effect ( FE ) or a r and om effect ( RE ) model depending on heterogeneity . In this meta- analysis , BCG vaccination was not associated with  HL  ( FE summary OR = 1.10 ; 95 % CI 0.93 - 1.30 ) , but positively associated with  NHL  ( RE summary OR = 1.20 ; 95 % CI 1.01 - 1.43 ) . However , when restricting to higher quality studies , no association was found between BCG vaccination and either  HL  ( RE summary OR = 0.97 ; 95 % CI 0.67 - 1.43 ) or  NHL  ( RE summary OR = 1.15 ; 95 % CI 0.84 - 1.59 ) . Overall , our findings do not support that BCG vaccination is associated with   lymphoma risk  .  Yet , lack of statistical power and relatively high heterogeneity among studies prevent us from making definitive conclusions . Future studies investigating this issue are needed , using robust methodology."

"yPurpose Methods to optimize positive  end-expiratory  pressure ( PEEP ) in  acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS )  remain controversial despite decades of research . The pressure – volume curve ( PVC ) , a graphical ventilator relationship , has been proposed for prescription of PEEP in ARDS . Whether the use of PVC ’s improves survival remains unclear . Methods In this systematic review , we assessed  r and omized  controlled trials  (  RCTs ) comparing  PVC-guided treatment  with  conventional PEEP management  on  survival in  ARDS   based on the  search of the National Library of Medicine from January 1 , 1960 , to January 1 , 2010  ,  and the Cochrane Central  Register  of  Controlled Trials .  Three RCTs were identified with a total of 185 patients , 97 with  PVC-guided treatment  and 88 with  conventional PEEP management .   Results The PVC-guided PEEP was associated with an increased probability  of 28-day or hospital survival  ( odds ratio [ OR ] 2.7 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1.5 , 4.9 ) using a r and om-effects model without significant heterogeneity ( I 2 test : P = .75 ) . The PVC-guided ventilator support was associated with  reduced cumulative risk of mortality  ( −0.24 ( 95 % CI −0.38 , −0.11 ) . The PVC-managed patients received  greater PEEP  ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] 5.7 cm H2O , 95 % CI 2.4 , 9.0 ) and  lower plateau pressures  ( SMD −1.2 cm H2O , 95 % CI −2.2 , −0.2 ) , albeit  with greater hypercapnia with increased arterial pCO2  ( SMD 8 mm Hg , 95 % CI  2  ,  14 ) . Weight-adjusted tidal volumes  were significantly lower in PVC-guided than conventional ventilator management ( SMD 2.6 mL/kg , 95 % CI −3.3 , −2.0 ) . Conclusion This analysis supports an association that ventilator management guided by the PVC for PEEP management may  augment survival  in ARDS . Nonetheless , only 3 r and omized trials have addressed the question , and the total number of patients remains low . Further outcomes studies appear required for the validation of this methodology."
" The limited evidence available suggests that  acupuncture  and  acupressure  may improve  both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS  when compared to a sham control . There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates  of adverse events .  There is no evidence comparing  acupuncture  or  acupressure  versus current ISPMD recommended treatments for PMS such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) . Further research is required , using vali date d outcome measures for PMS , adequate blinding and suitable comparator groups reflecting current best practice."
"tIntensified  chemotherapy regimens  result ing in improved  survival  of  children with acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL )  lead to concerns about therapy-induced immune damage reflected by the loss of protection of previous immunizations and the efficacy of (re-)vaccination . The severity of secondary immunodeficiency , however , is not clear and knowledge is based on a limited number of studies . We performed a systematic review on literature concerning  vaccination  data of  children with ALL published since 1980 . Eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria  . Regarding  antibody titers  after treatment , the number of children who had preserved the defined  protection level for antibodies  differed widely , ranging from 17 to 98 % for diphtheria , 27 to 82 % for Bordetella pertussis , 20 to 98 % for tetanus , 62 to 100 % for poliomyelitis , 35 to 100 % for Haemophilus influenzae type B ( HiB ) , 29 to 92 % for mumps , 29 to 60 % for measles and 72 to 92 % for rubella . Most patients however responded to revaccination , demonstrating  immunological recovery .  Although the design s and results of the included studies varied widely , it can be concluded that  cytostatic therapy  for ALL in children results in a temporarily reduction of  specific antibody levels .  Memory is preserved but revaccination may be warranted . This is the first systematic review and the best possible current approximation of chemotherapy-induced  immune damage  in children after ALL treatment."
"sThis systematic review of the literature focuses on the influence of ethnic , cultural , and geographic factors on the  caregivers of patients with dementia .  In particular , we explore the impact of cultural expectations on five important questions : 1 ) Do the characteristics of dementia affect  caregiver burden  ? 2 ) Do characteristics of the caregiver independently predict burden ? 3 ) Does the caregiver affect patient outcomes ? 4 ) Does support or  intervention  for caregiver result in reduced  caregiver burden  or improved  patient outcomes  ? 5 ) Finally , do patient interventions result in reduced  caregiver burden  or improved  patient outcomes  ? Our findings suggest that noncognitive , behavioral disturbances of patients with dementia result in increased  caregiver burden  and that  female caregivers  bear a particularly heavy burden across cultures , particularly in  Asian societies .  Caregiver  burden  influences time to medical presentation of  patients with dementia  , patient condition at presentation , and patient institutionalization . Moreover , interventions design ed to reduce  caregiver burden  have been largely , although not universally , unsuccessful .  Pharmacological treatments  for symptoms of dementia were found to be beneficial in reducing  caregiver burden .  The consistency of findings across studies , geographic regions , cultural differences , and heathcare delivery systems is striking . Yet , there are critical differences in cultural expectations and social re sources . Future interventions to reduce  caregiver burden  must consider these differences , identify patients and  caregivers  at greatest risk , and develop targeted programs that combine aspects of a number of interventional strategies."
"tObjective To identify  bronchoscopy-related complications and discomfort  , meaningful complication rates , and predictors . Method We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on  8 February 2016  , using a search strategy including the  PICO model  , on complications and discomfort related to   bronchoscopy  and related sampling techniques .  Results The search yielded  1,707 hits  ,  of which 45 publications were eligible for full review .   Rates of mortality and severe complications  were low . Other complications , for instance ,  hypoxaemia , bleeding , pneumothorax , and fever  , were usually not related to patient characteristics or aspects of the procedure , and complication  rates  showed considerable ranges . Measures  of patient discomfort  differed considerably , and results were difficult to compare between different study population s. Conclusion More research on safety aspects of bronchoscopy is needed to conclude on complication rates and patient- and procedure-related predictors of complications and discomfort."

 Studies on speech outcomes after TL are flawed in design and represent weak levels of evidence . There is an urge for st and ardized measurement tools for evaluations of substitute voice speakers . TES is the favorable speech rehabilitation method according to acoustic and perceptual outcomes . All speaker groups after TL report a degree of  voice h and icap .  Knowledge of caretakers and differences in health care and insurance systems play a role in the speech rehabilitation options that can be offered.
" Compared to alternative dietary approaches ,  st and ard RUTF  probably improves  recovery  and may increase  rate of weight gain  slightly , but the effects on  relapse and mortality  are unknown . St and  ard RUTF  meeting total daily nutritional requirements may improve  recovery and relapse  compared to a similar RUTF given as a supplement to the usual diet , but the effects on  mortality and rate of weight gain  are not clear . When comparing RUTFs with different formulations , the current evidence does not favour a particular formulation , except for  relapse  , which is reduced with  st and ard RUTF .  Well- design ed , adequately powered , pragmatic RCTs with st and ardised outcome measures , stratified by HIV status , and that include  diarrhoea  as an outcome , are needed."
" The effects of  physical exercise training interventions  for  childhood cancer participants  are not yet convincing . Possible reasons are the small numbers of participants and insufficient study design s , but it can also be that this type of intervention is not as effective as in adult cancer patients . However , the first results show some positive effects on  physical fitness  in the intervention group compared to the control group . There were positive intervention effects for  body composition , flexibility , cardiorespiratory fitness , muscle strength , and health-related quality of life  ( cancer-related items ) . These were measured by some assessment methods , but not all . However , the quality of the evidence was low and these positive effects were not found for the other assessed outcomes , such as  fatigue , level of daily activity , and adverse events .  There is a need for more studies with comparable aims and interventions , using a higher number of participants that also include diagnoses other than ALL."
"gFifteen meta-analyses have been published between 1995 and 2011 to evaluate the  efficacy/effectiveness and harms  of diverse  influenza vaccines -- seasonal , H5N1 and 2009 (H1N1)--in   various age-classes ( healthy children , adults or elderly ) .  These meta-analyses have often adopted different analyses and study selection criteria . Because it is difficult to have a clear picture of vaccine benefits and harms examining single systematic review s , we compiled the main findings and evaluated which could be the most reasonable explanations for some differences in findings ( or their interpretation ) across previously published meta-analyses . For  each age group  , we performed analyses that included all trials that had been included in at least one relevant meta- analysis , also exploring whether effect sizes changed over time . Although we identified several discrepancies among the meta-analyses on seasonal vaccines for  children and elderly  , overall most seasonal influenza vaccines showed statistically significant  efficacy/effectiveness  , which was acceptable or high for laboratory-confirmed cases and of modest magnitude for clinical ly-confirmed cases . The available evidence on parenteral  inactivated vaccines  for  children aged < 2 y  remains scarce . Pre-p and emic  "" avian "" H5N1 and p and  emic 2009 ( H1N1 ) vaccines can achieve satisfactory  immunogenicity  , but no meta- analysis has addressed H1N1 vaccination impact on clinical outcomes . Data on harms are overall reassuring , but their value is diminished by inconsistent reporting."
"dA better underst and ing of transmission dynamics is essential in influenza p and emic planning . If a substantial proportion of transmissions were to occur during the  presymptomatic phase  or from  asymptomatic individuals  , then infection control measures such as contact tracing and quarantine of exposures would be of limited value . Infectiousness has been inferred based on the presence of influenza in the upper respiratory tract rather than from transmission experiments . Although asymptomatic individuals may shed influenza virus , studies have not determined if such people effectively transmit influenza  .  We performed a systematic review of published studies describing the relationship between  viral shedding  and  disease transmission .  Based on the available literature , we found that there is scant , if any , evidence that  asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals  play an important role in  influenza transmission .  As such , recent articles concerning p and  emic  planning , some using transmission modeling , may have overestimated the effect of  presymptomatic or asymptomatic influenza transmission .  More definitive transmission studies are sorely needed."

" Effectiveness of self-management interventions and result ing recommendations for health policy makers are most frequently derived from highly variable evaluation-based measures , that is , types of outcomes that potentially carry a substantial amount of measurement error and /or bias such as response shift .

More research , especially qualitative studies , is needed to unravel cognitive processes and the role of response shift bias in the measurement of change."
" This review provides encouraging evidence that  antenatal  nutritional  education  with the aim of increasing energy and protein intake in the general obstetric population appears to be effective in reducing the risk of  preterm birth , low birthweight , increasing head circumference at birth  ,  increasing birthweight  among  undernourished  women , and increasing  protein intake  . There was no evidence of benefit or adverse effect for any other outcome reported .  Balanced energy and protein supplementation  seems to improve  fetal growth  , and may reduce the  risk of stillbirth and infants born small-for-gestational age .   High-protein supplementation  does not seem to be beneficial and may be harmful to the fetus .  Balanced-protein supplementation  alone had no significant effects on perinatal outcomes .The results of this review should be interpreted with caution . The risk of bias was either unclear or high for at least one category examined in several of the included trials , and the quality of the evidence was low for several important outcomes . Also , as the anthropometric characteristics of the general obstetric population is changing , those developing interventions aim ed at altering energy and protein intake should ensure that only those women likely to benefit are included . Large , well- design ed r and omised trials are needed to assess the effects of increasing energy and protein intake during pregnancy in  women  whose intake is below recommended levels."
" Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of  oral corticosteroids  is likely to be sufficient for treatment of  adults with acute exacerbations of COPD  , and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of  systemic corticosteroids  ( of around five days ) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer ( 10 to 14 days ) courses . We grade d most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision ; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates . The studies in this review did not include  people with mild or moderate COPD ;  further studies comparing short- duration  systemic corticosteroid  versus conventional longer- duration  systemic corticosteroid  for treatment of  adults with acute exacerbations of COPD  are required."

"DPatients  with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) or ulcerative colitis ( UC )  undergo various therapies , including  antibiotic therapy .  This meta- analysis of controlled clinical trials was conducted to evaluate whether the use of  antibacterial therapy  improves the clinical symptoms of  inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .  The Medline and Scopus data bases were search ed and a systematic review was performed . R and omized , controlled trials in which  antibiotic therapy  was compared with  placebo  were investigated . A total of  10 r and omized ,  placebo-controlled  clinical trials for CD were included  in the meta-  analysis  . The pooling of the data from these trials yielded an  odds ratio ( OR )  of 1.35 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.16 - 1.58 ] for  antibiotic therapy  compared with  placebo  in  patients with CD .  Furthermore , nine r and omized placebo-controlled clinical trials for UC matched our criteria and were included in the analysis . The pooling of the data from these trials yielded an  OR  of 2.17 ( 95 % CI , 1.54 - 3.05 ) in favor of  antibiotic therapy .  These results suggest that   antibiotics  improve clinical outcomes  in patients with IBD."
" Despite the importance of minimizing time on mechanical ventilation , only limited guidance on weaning and extubation is available from the pediatric literature . A significant proportion of patients being evaluated for weaning are actually ready for extubation , suggesting that weaning is often not considered early enough in the course of ventilation . Indications for extubation are even less clear , although a trial of spontaneous breathing would seem a prerequisite . Several indices have been developed in an attempt to predict  weaning and extubation success  but the available literature would suggest they offer no improvement over clinical judgment .  Extubation failure rates  range from 2 % to 20 % and bear little relationship to the  duration of mechanical ventilation . Upper airway obstruction  is the single most common cause of extubation  failure  . A reliable method of assessing  readiness for weaning  and predicting  extubation success  is not evident from the pediatric literature."
"tPURPOSE OF REVIEW  Metformin  has become an established treatment for  women with polycystic ovary syndrome  , although controversy remains as to how effective it is and in which population s it should be used . This review examines the recent literature in order to ascertain the evidence for the benefits and disadvantages of using  metformin  in  women with polycystic ovary syndrome .  RECENT FINDINGS A Cochrane systematic review and meta analysis examined the evidence for  metformin  in treating  polycystic ovary syndrome .  Since this was published there have been a number of new trials , some of which have been reasonably large involving  participants from many different countries .  SUMMARY Evidence shows that  metformin  is  effective in inducing ovulation  , has some  marginal benefit in improving aspects of the metabolic syndrome  ,  improves objective measures of hirsutism  , and seems to be  effective  in both  obese and lean individuals .  However , it has significant  side effects  , and the  high levels of effectiveness  that were reported by some early trials have not been replicated .  Metformin  should always be used as an adjuvant to  general lifestyle improvements  , and not as a replacement for  increased exercise  and improved diet."

"yObjective : To undertake a systematic review and meta- analysis of the effectiveness of  play-based interventions  compared to  traditional therapy  in  rehabilitation of adults with adult-acquired brain injury .  Data sources : The search was performed using Medline ; Cinahl Plus ; Health Source ( Nursing/Academic Edition ) ; Psychology and behavioural sciences collection ; Biomedical reference collection ( basic ) . Review methods : Studies included were r and  omised  controlled trials that investigated the effect of  play-based interventions  on physical function of  adults with adult acquired brain injury .  Two independent review ers identified eligible studies and assessed method ological quality using a modified Downs and Black . Meta- analysis compared st and ardised differences in means , to determine effect sizes for grouped functional outcome measures . The GRADE scoring system was used to determine the level of clinical evidence . Results :  Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria , 13 were considered high quality and 17 moderate quality . Studies predominantly involved post-stroke participants , with only three studies including participants with traumatic brain injury .  When compared to  traditional therapy  , dose-matched studies of  play-based interventions  showed a significant effect on  independence  ( Effect size ( ES ) = 0.6 ) and  physical performance  ( ES = 0.43 ) , as measured using the  Fugl –Meyer .  For non-dose matched studies  , play-based interventions  showed a significant  improvement for balance  ( ES = 0.76 ) compared  with traditional therapy .  In all studies that measured  participant enjoyment   , play-based therapy  was rated as more   enjoyable  than traditional therapy .  Conclusion :  Play-based interventions  for  people with adult acquired brain injury  are more effective in  improving balance and independence  , which may be due to them being more enjoyable than traditional therapy."

Specifically , in  individuals with moderate to severe impairment following a stroke  , previous evidence for effective treatments that recover h and function in this population is limited , and thus has never been review ed . With the progress of rehabilitation science and tool development , results from more and more clinical trials are now available , thereby justifying conducting a systematic review . METHODS AND ANALYSIS This systematic review protocol is consistent with the methodology recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis Protocol s and the Cochrane h and book for systematic review s of interventions . Electronic search es will be carried out in the PubMed , CINAHL , Physiotherapy Evidence Data base and Cochrane Library data bases , along with manual search es in the reference lists from included studies and published systematic review s. The date range parameters used in search ing all data bases is between January 1999 and January 2019 . R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) published in English , with the primary outcome focusing on  h and motor function  , will be included . Two review ers will screen all retrieved titles , abstract s and full texts , perform the evaluation of the risk bias and extract all data independently . The  risk of bias  of the included RCTs will be evaluated by the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool . A qualitative synthesis will be provided in text and table , to summarise the main results of the selected publications . A meta- analysis will be considered if there is sufficient homogeneity across outcomes . The  quality  of the included publications will be evaluated by the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation system  from the Cochrane H and book for Systematic Review s of Interventions . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is needed , and the results of this review will be disseminated via peer- review ed publications and conference presentations . TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42019128285."
"  Oral calorie supplements  do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of  moderately malnourished children  with  CF  over and above the use of  dietary advice  and monitoring alone . While  nutritional  supplements may be used , they should not be regarded as essential . Further r and omised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of  oral protein energy supplements  for the short-term in people with CF and acute weight loss and also for the long-term  nutritional management  of adults with CF or advanced lung disease , or both."
"sWe conducted a systematic review of controlled trials and pre-post studies to examine whether the putative benefits of  telehealth  , notably , improvements in  clinical outcomes and quality of life  , are mediated by increases in  knowledge , self-efficacy and self-care behaviour  in  patients with heart failure .   Telehealth  was defined as any system of home-based  self-monitoring  of signs or symptoms of heart failure that transferred data for remote assessment by healthcare providers .  Seven electronic data bases were  search ed for studies that assessed any of six pathways in a proposed model . Data were independently extracted by two review ers .  Twelve studies met  the  inclusion criteria  and provided evidence for or against one or more of the six pathways . Although all of the pathways in the model can be theoretically justified and three of the six relationships have been established in heart failure sample s outside the context of telehealth , none of the pathways in the model were supported by the telehealth studies review ed . Failure to replicate previously established relationships emphasizes the weakness of the telehealth literature , which impedes our ability to address questions such as how  telehealth  might achieve beneficial outcomes."
"sObjective : To systematic ally review the effect of  psychosocial interventions  on improving  QoL , depression and anxiety  of  cancer caregivers .  Methods : We conducted a systematic review of  psychosocial interventions   among adult cancer caregivers published from 2011 to 2016 .  PsycINFO , PubMed , Proquest , Cochrane Library , Embase , Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstract s ( ASSIA ) , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , Social Sciences Citation Index ( SSCI ) and EBSCO , China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) and WANFANG were search ed . Inclusion criteria were : r and omized controlled trails ( RCTs ) ; psychosocial intervention to cancer caregivers ;  psychosocial  health indicators including  quality of life , depression or anxiety  . Results :  21 studies out of 4,666 identified abstract s  met inclusion criteria , including 19 RCTs . The intervention modes fell into the following nine categories :  family connect intervention , self-determination theory-based intervention ( SDT ) , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , emotion-focused therapy ( EFT ) , comprehensive health enhancement support system ( CHESS ) , FOCUS programme , existential behavioral therapy ( EBT ) , telephone interpersonal counseling ( TIP-C ) , problem-solving intervention ( COPE ) .  Conclusion :  paired-intervention  targeting self-care and interpersonal connections of caregivers and symptom management of patients is effective in  improving quality of life and alleviating depression  of  cancer caregivers  while  music therapy  is helpful for  reducing anxiety  of cancer caregivers."
"sPROBLEM IDENTIFICATION To evaluate the effects of  peer-led supportive interventions  for  patients with cancer .  . LITERATURE SEARCH Six electronic data bases ( EMBASE , MEDLINE ® , Google Scholar , Cochrane Library , ProQuest Medical Library , and CINAHL ® ) were search ed for  articles published from 1997 to May 2017 .  . DATA EVALUATION  A total of 159 studies were identified . Eighteen ( 16 r and omized , controlled trials [ RCTs ] and 2 non- RCTs )  were eligible for systematic review and 16 for meta- analysis . The Cochrane risk of bias tool and Comprehensive Meta- Analysis software were used for analysis . . SYNTHESIS The authors synthesized the results of the effect size of each trial according  to cancer symptoms , coping , emotional health , quality of life , self-efficacy , sexuality , social support , and health-related behaviors  . . IMPLICATION S FOR RESEARCH The findings from this study suggest that an additional tiered evaluation that has a theoretical underpinning and high- quality methodology is required to confirm the efficacy  of peer-led supportive interventions  within cancer care models."
"  Patients with active UC  experience a clinical ly meaningful  burden of disease  across most aspects of quality of life .  Patients with inactive UC  exhibit negligible  disease burden  and are comparable to the general population on most  quality -of-life outcomes  . Thus , treatments which effectively induce and maintain remission may restore physical and mental health status."
"  Combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy  could be a viable option for  patients of good performance status with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer  , but further trials that report adequate survival and  QoL  data are sought .  Response rates and improvements in survival  are low .  Cisplatin-based  combinations have significant  toxicity .  Outcomes are poor and novel cytotoxic/biological agents and optimal scheduling need further investigation . Future trials need to stratify for and perform planned subgroup analysis with respect to previous treatment and site of recurrence."
"gThe primary objective of this review was to investigate the current evidence base for the use of  choice architecture  as a means to change  eating behaviour  in self-service  eating  setting s , hence potentially reduce calorie intake .  Twelve data  bases were search ed systematic ally for  experimental studies with  predefined choice architecture interventions  in the period of June 2011-March 2012 .  The  12 included  studies were grouped according to type of interventions and underwent a narrative synthesis . The evidence indicates that ( i ) health labelling at point of purchase is associated with healthier food choice , while ( ii ) manipulating the plate and cutlery size has an inconclusive effect on  consumption  volume . Finally , ( iii ) assortment manipulation and ( iv ) payment option manipulation was associated with healthier food choices . The majority of studies were of very weak quality and future research should emphasize a real-life setting and compare their results with the effect of other more well-established interventions on  food behaviour  in self-service eating setting."
" Careful consideration of underlying evidence and theory to drive intervention design , facilitated by the BCW , enabled identification of appropriate intervention components . BCTs including  Habit Formation , Information about Health Consequences and Self-monitoring of Behaviour  were considered potentially effective and appropriate to deliver within the NHS . Having reduced the pool of potential intervention components to a manageable number , it will now be possible to explore the perceived acceptability of selected BCTs in interviews with stroke survivors and healthcare professionals . This approach to intervention development should be generalisable to other chronic conditions and areas of behaviour change ( e.g. exercise adherence )."
"  Anti-tuberculous therapy  may provide a benefit over  placebo  for the prevention of relapse in  participants with Crohn 's disease in remission .  However , this result is very uncertain due to unclear study quality and the small numbers of patients assessed . Further studies are needed to provide better quality evidence for the use of  anti-tuberculous therapy  for maintaining remission in people with quiescent Crohn 's disease."
" There was no conclusive evidence supporting  any antenatal BF education  for  improving initiation of BF , proportion of women giving any BF or exclusively BF  at three or six months or the duration of BF . There is an urgent need to conduct a high- quality , r and omised controlled study to evaluate the  effectiveness  and  adverse  effects of  antenatal BF education  , especially in  low- and middle-income countries  . Evidence in this review is primarily relevant to  high-income setting ."
"sBACKGROUND  Pillboxes  are widely available , have evidence of effectiveness , but translating pillboxes in self-management interventions requires an underst and ing of intervention components . PURPOSE To review components of  intervention design  ,  interventionist training  , delivery , receipt , enactment , and targeted behaviors in adherence studies . METHODS  Five multidisciplinary data bases  were search ed to find reports of controlled trials testing  pillboxes and medication adherence interventions  in  adults managing medications .  Details of treatment fidelity , that is , design , training , delivery , receipt , and enactment , were abstract ed . FINDINGS A total  of 38 articles reporting 40 studies were included .   Treatment fidelity descriptions  were often lacking , especially reporting receipt and  enactment  , important for both control and intervention groups . Clearly reported details are needed to avoid making assumptions when translating evidence .  These findings serve as a call to action to explicitly state intervention details . Lack of reported intervention detail is a barrier to translating which components of pillboxes work in influencing medication adherence behaviors and outcomes."
" Analyses of exhaled breath yielded promising results , although st and ardization of breath collection , sample storage and data h and ling remain critical issues . In order to foster  breath analysis  implementation into practice , larger studies should be implemented in true screening setting s , paying particular attention to st and ardization in breath collection , consideration of covariates , and validation in independent population sample."
"sBackground :  Vitamin D  serum levels and the presence and activity of rheumatic conditions have been associated . However , many studies are merely observational , and the existent r and omized clinical trials were never systematic ally analyzed . Therefore , this study aims to provide a systematic review and meta- analysis of such a topic . Methods :  MEDLINE , EMBASE , LILACS  ,  COCHRANE  , and  CINAHL  were explored to identify r and omized trials that investigated clinical repercussions of  vitamin D ( or analogs ) supplementation  for at least 3 months in  rheumatic diseases .  St and ardized clinical and /or laboratorial outcomes related to disease activity were analyzed according to each disease before and after supplementation . Results : Data base search es  rendered 668 results ; 9 were included—5 on rheumatoid arthritis , 3 on systemic lupus erythematosus , and 1 on systemic sclerosis .  Seven of the studies were meta-analyzed . After  vitamin D supplementation  ,  rheumatoid arthritis recurrence  decreased ; however , not significantly ( risk difference = −0.10 , 95 % CI = −0.21 , 0.00 , P = .05 ) . No statistical significance was observed  regarding visual analog scale  ( mean difference = 2.79 , 95 % CI = −1.87 , 7.44 ,  P  =  .24 ) and disease activity score28  ( mean difference = −0.31 , 95 % CI = −0.86 , 0.25 , P = .28 ) . Regarding systemic lupus  erythematosus , anti-dsDNA positivity  was significantly reduced ( risk difference = −0.10 , 95 % CI = −0.18 , −0.03 ; P = .005 ) .  Conclusion : Vitamin D supplementation   reduced anti-dsDNA  positivity on systemic lupus erythematosus and could possibly reduce rheumatoid arthritis recurrence , although novel r and omized clinical trials are needed to confirm and extend the benefits of this hormone in immune-mediated rheumatic diseases."
"sPurpose  Undergoing  chemotherapy  and radiotherapy  can be physically and psychologically stressful for  people with cancer .  Providing preparatory  information  to  cancer patients  as they face treatment and its aftermath has the potential to improve patient outcomes . This study assessed the method ological quality and effectiveness of interventions providing  preparatory information about chemotherapy and /or radiotherapy  to  cancer patients  in improving patient outcomes and health care use . Methods MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Cochrane data bases were systematic ally search ed from January 1995 until  October 2012 .  Inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) met Effective Practice and Organisation of Care ( EPOC ) criteria for study design ; ( 2  ) included adults with a current cancer diagnosis ;  (  3 ) delivered  preparatory  information  via  a health care  provider or was  self-directed ;  ( 4 ) examined  psychological well-being  ,  quality of life  , physical symptoms , satisfaction , knowledge , or health service utilisation . Studies were assessed for method ological quality using the EPOC criteria . Results  Eighteen studies involving 3,443 cancer patients met inclusion criteria .  Interventions included  written information , audiotapes , videotapes  , and  computer programs .  Interventions  improved patient satisfaction  ( 6/7  studies ) , information needs and patient knowledge  ( 5/6  studies )  ,  physical symptoms  ( 3/4  studies ) and cost  ( 1/1 study ) . More than half of the interventions  improved psychological outcomes and quality of life  ( 10/17 studies ) . Conclusion Providing preparatory  information  can improve  patient-reported outcomes  in  cancer patients  undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , especially with respect to satisfaction and  knowledge  . Some , but not all , studies improved  psychological outcomes  and physical symptoms . There is a need for method ologically rigorous research to determine the most effective timing and method of delivery of preparatory information to improve patient outcomes."
"  ω-3 PUFAs  may have a therapeutic role in  decreasing pain  associated with RA , with doses of 3 to 6 g/d appearing to have a greater effect . Due to the limitations identified in the RCTs included in this review , more research is needed to investigate  ω-3 PUFAs  in larger population s and over extended periods of time."
" A great diversity of  sham acupressure  controls have been used in clinical practice and research . A solid conclusion whether different sham alternatives are related to different  treatment outcomes  can not be derived because of significant clinical heterogeneity among the analyzed trials . Non-acupoints are generally recommended but the definite locations should be identified with caution . For studies using single sham acupoints on h and s or legs , it is suggested to apply identical  acupressure  devices on the same acupoint as in the active intervention without any stimulation . While for studies on pain , stimulation of sham acupoints should be avoided."
" Based on an analysis of the studies ,  acupuncture  improves  the CPR   among women undergoing IVF .  When the studies were restricted to  Asian or non-Asian area patients  , compared with  traditional acupuncture  and other methods ,  electrical acupuncture  yielded  better IVF outcomes  . Optimal positive effects could be expected using  acupuncture  in IVF during COH , especially in Asian area . However , as a limitation of this review , most of the included studies did not mention the number of embryos transferred."
"sRecent Phase III data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) 2013 annual conference by Brose et al led to the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval of  sorafenib  for the treatment of  well-differentiated radioactive iodine-resistant metastatic thyroid cancer .  This is the second drug in 40 years to be FDA approved for this indication . Recent review s and a meta- analysis reveal a modest ability to induce  a partial remission  but substantial ability to  halt disease progression .  Given the significant activating mutations present in thyroid cancer , many of which are inhibited by  sorafenib  , the next logical approach may be to combine targeted rational therapies if permitted by collective toxicity profiles . This systematic review aims to summarize the recent Phase II/III data leading to the FDA approval of  sorafenib  for radioactive iodine therapy  differentiated thyroid  cancer and highlights recent novel combination therapy trials."
"sLong-chain  omega-3 fatty acids  could have  neuroprotective properties  against   dementia   , which is becoming a major global public health issue . We conducted a systematic review of the literature to establish the association between eating  fish  ( a source of long-chain omega-3  fatty acids )  or taking  long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplements  and the risk  of cognitive decline  or Alzheimer disease  (  AD )  .  We identified  eleven observational studies and four clinical trials .  All three observational studies that used  cognitive decline  as an outcome reported significant benefits , whereas only four of eight observational studies that used  incidence of AD or dementia  as an outcome reported positive findings . None of four small clinical trials provided convincing evidence for the use of this approach in the  prevention or treatment of any form of dementia .  In summary , the existing data favor a role for long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in slowing  cognitive decline   in elderly individuals without dementia  , but not for the  prevention or treatment of dementia ( including AD ) .  This apparent dichotomy might reflect differences in study design s with regard to participants , dosages , the ratio of long-chain omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids , or the choice of outcome measurements . Large clinical trials of extended duration should help to provide definitive answers."
"nBackground Allergies cause a considerable burden to both sufferers and the National Health Service . There is growing interest in  acupuncture  as a treatment for a range of conditions . Since acupuncture may modulate the immune system it could be a useful treatment for  allergic rhinitis ( AR ) sufferers .  We therefore assessed the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of  acupuncture  in  patients with AR  by performing a systematic review of the literature . Methods Search es  (  to 2007  )  were conducted in all major data bases for r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the clinical effectiveness of  acupuncture  in the treatment of AR . No limits were placed on language . Studies were included if they compared  acupuncture to a sham or inactive acupuncture treatment ( placebo ) with or without st and ard care .  Meta- analysis was performed where feasible . Results  Seven relevant  RCTs were included after screening and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria . The trials were generally of poor quality as assessed by a  modified Jadad scale  , with the exception of two studies which scored highly . A wide variety of outcomes was measured but most assessed  symptom severity  on a  visual analogue scale .  A meta- analysis failed to show any summary benefits of  acupuncture  treatment  for symptom severity scores or serum IgE measures  which could not have been accounted for by chance alone .  Acupuncture  was not associated with any additional  adverse events  in the trials . Conclusion There is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of  acupuncture  in  patients with AR .  A large well conducted RCT , which overcomes identified method ological problems in the existing RCTs , would be required to resolve this question."
" Overall , the data do not provide strong or consistent evidence that responsive feeding affects important outcomes for  preterm infants or their families .  Some ( low quality ) evidence exists that preterm infants fed in response to  feeding and  satiation cues achieve  full oral feeding  earlier than infants fed prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals . This finding should be interpreted cautiously because of method ological weaknesses in the included trials . A large RCT would be needed to confirm this finding and to determine if responsive feeding of preterm infants affects other important outcomes."
"hABSTRACT The  dietary  total antioxidant capacity  ( TAC )  has been a useful tool in epidemiological studies . To assess whether the TAC is associated with  chronic diseases in middle-aged and older adults  carried out a systematic review of articles indexed in MEDLINE and Science Direct .  Of the 104 articles found , nine were included to meet the inclusion criteria .  There was variation among the items on the sample size , sample origin , use of statistical tests , analysis of different outcomes and the use of assays to evaluate the  TAC  , which brought limitations to the comparability of results on the association of  TAC  with the outcomes of interest . However , in six studies we found an inverse association between  TAC  and the risk of chronic diseases , showing that this method has great potential for clinical applications and public health."
"eBACKGROUND The role for  adjuvant radiotherapy ( ART )  after curative resection in  extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma  remains unclear . Due to the lack of r and omized trials , available data comes from single center experiences or data -based population studies with inconclusive results . OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of  radiotherapy ( with or without concurrent chemotherapy )  on  toxicity and survival  of  radically resected patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer ( extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder cancer and pure ampullary cancer ) .  DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Eligible studies with data on  survival , recurrence and toxicity  were retrieved from the MEDLINE , ISI web of science , EMBASE and Cochrane data bases from January 1995 to December 2008 , to ensure that all  ART  treatments were performed with conventional  3D techniques  . In the absence of r and omized controlled- studies , all observational cohort studies ( longitudinal and historical ) were initially considered .  Ten retrospective cohort studies  ( where the use of concurrent CT was reported only in 2 ) , met all inclusion criteria and were enrolled for final meta- analysis .  Hazard ratio ( HR )  had to be extracted from survival curves using the Tierney et al. methods . MIX 1.7 statistical software was used for meta- analysis . RESULTS All studies on  ART  used conventional 3D-techniques . Patients in the ART cohorts were more likely to have involved  surgical margins  and  positive lymph nodes .  For extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma location ,  ART  significantly  improved overall survival  ( HR 0.62 ; 95 % CI 0.48 to 0.78 , p<0.001 ) . Meta- analysis was not feasible for gallbladder cancer and ampullary cancer locations .  Late radiation-induced toxicity  was low ( 2 - 9 % late obstruction or GI bleeding ) .  In the absence of r and omized controlled studies , we found in the present systematic review and meta- analysis of observational studies that ,  patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma  treated with  adjuvant RT  have a significant  lower risk of dying  compared to patients treated with surgery alone."
"nDietary  assessment methods  that are recognized as appropriate for the general population are usually applied in a similar manner to  athletes  , despite the knowledge that sport-specific factors can complicate assessment and impact accuracy in unique ways . As  dietary assessment  methods are used extensively within the field of sports nutrition , there is concern the validity of method ologies have not undergone more rigorous evaluation in this unique population sub-group . The purpose of this systematic review was to compare two or more methods  of  dietary assessment   ,  including  dietary intake  measured against biomarkers or reference measures  of energy expenditure , in  athletes . Six electronic data bases  were search ed for  English- language , full-text articles published from January 1980 until June 2016 .  The search strategy combined the following keywords : diet , nutrition assessment , athlete , and validity ; where the following outcomes are reported but not limited to :  energy intake , macro and /or micronutrient intake , food intake , nutritional adequacy , diet quality , or nutritional status .  Meta- analysis was performed on studies with sufficient method ological similarity , with between-group st and ardized mean differences ( or effect size ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) being calculated . Of the  1624 studies identified , 18 were eligible for inclusion .  Studies comparing  self-reported energy intake ( EI ) to energy expenditure  assessed via  doubly labelled water  were grouped for comparison ( n = 11 ) and demonstrated  mean  EI was under-estimated by 19 % ( −2793 ± 1134 kJ/day ) . Meta- analysis revealed a large pooled effect size of −1.006 ( 95 % CI : −1.3 to −0.7 ; p < 0.001 ) . The remaining studies ( n = 7 ) compared a new dietary tool or instrument to a reference method ( s ) ( e.g. , food record , 24-h dietary recall , biomarker ) as part of a validation study . This systematic review revealed there are limited robust studies evaluating dietary  assessment  methods in  athletes .  Existing literature demonstrates the substantial variability between methods , with under- and misreporting of intake being frequently observed . There is a clear need for careful validation of  dietary assessment  methods , including emerging technical innovations , among athlete population."
" This analysis provided no support for the hypothesis that the agents studied provide any clinical benefit for  renal cancer patients  although they increase the  risk of toxic effects .  R and omized trials are underway to test targeted therapies , which might open a new therapeutic frontier . Until these trials yield results , no  adjuvant therapy  can be recommended for patients who undergo surgical resection for renal cell cancer."
"sPurpose of review The purpose of this article is to provide an up date d review exploring the recent developments in the field of  self-guided interventions  and describe the state of knowledge . This article builds on a previous systematic review on  self-guided interventions  , finding that the recent literature demonstrates that evidence for these interventions is mixed . The field is limited by descriptions of these interventions , and it is not possible to ascertain what aspects of interventions are more successful . Recent findings Development of a reporting framework whereby self-guided interventions could be clearly presented , would be a substantial contribution to underst and ing the evidence for these studies . Recent findings also support the need to underst and  patient adherence and engagement  , which could be achieved within a reporting framework . Additionally , ensuring patient safety is paramount and all studies should develop strategies to ensure patients can engage with these studies in a way that allows them to access more help and support if required . Summary  Self-guided interventions  have potential for implementation and further translation because of being  cost-effective  and requiring few re sources ; and a reporting framework has the capacity to lead to clearer definitions and descriptions ; and significantly improve the quality of evidence for these studies."
"yBACKGROUND The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) recently approved two-dose immunization schedules for  bivalent ( HPV 16/18 )  and  quadrivalent ( HPV 6/11/16/18 ) human papillomavirus  (  HPV ) vaccines  in  nine to fourteen and thirteen year-old-girls , respectively .  Registration was based on trials comparing immunogenicity of two-dose schedules in  girls 9 - 14 years to three-dose schedules in young women 15 - 26 years .  We evaluate comparability of  antibody levels  between and within  age groups  and discuss potential implication s for monitoring the effectiveness of HPV vaccination . METHODS A systematic literature search was performed for studies comparing immunogenicity of  two- to three-dose schedules of HPV vaccination .  We compared  geometric mean concentrations ( GMCs )  of vaccine-type  antibodies  between different dosing schedules across different age groups . Meta- analysis was used to estimate  pooled GMC ratios  ( bivalent vaccine ) of two- compared with three-dose schedules within girls . FINDINGS For both vaccines , two-dose immunization of girls yielded  non-inferior GMCs  relative to a three-dose schedule in  young women  up to respectively 36 and 48 months follow-up .  Pooled GMC ratios  for the bivalent vaccine within girls showed the two-dose schedule becoming inferior to the three-dose schedule in girls for HPV 16 at approximately two years after the first dose . For the quadrivalent vaccine ,  antibody responses for HPV-18  became inferior from 18 months follow-up onwards when comparing the two-dose schedule with the three-dose schedule within girls . IMPLICATION S Two-dose immunization of girls has non-inferior  immunogenicity  compared to a three-dose schedule among young women . However , non-inferior  immunogenicity  of two- compared with three-dose schedules within girls has not been shown at all time points . Due to this inconclusive evidence , implementation of two-dose HPV vaccination needs to be monitored closely."
"eAim . To summarize all relevant trials and critically evaluate the effect of   acupuncture  on  heart rate variability ( HRV ) .   Method . This was a systematic review with meta- analysis . Keyword search was conducted in 7 data bases for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Data extraction and risk of bias were done . Results .  Fourteen included studies  showed a decreasing effect of  acupuncture  on  low frequency ( LF ) and low frequency to high frequency ratio ( LF/HF ratio ) of HRV  for nonhealthy subjects and on normalized low frequency ( LF norm ) for healthy subjects . The overall effect was in favour of the sham/control group for high frequency ( HF ) in nonhealthy subjects and for normalized high frequency ( HF norm ) in healthy subjects . Significant decreasing effect on  HF and LF/HF ratio of HRV  when  acupuncture  was performed on ST36 among healthy subjects and PC6 among both healthy and nonhealthy subjects , respectively . Discussion . This study partially supports the possible effect of  acupuncture  in modulating the  LF of HRV  in both healthy and  nonhealthy  subjects , while previous review reported that  acupuncture  did not have any convincing effect on HRV in healthy subjects . More published work is needed in this area to determine if HRV can be an indicator of the therapeutic effect of acupuncture."
" The results suggest  Tai Chi  does not exacerbate  symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis .  In addition ,  Tai Chi  has statistically significant benefits on  lower extremity range of motion  , in particular  ankle range of motion  , for people with RA . The included studies did not assess the effects on patient-reported pain."
"dDementia  Care Mapping ( DCM )  is an observational tool set within a practice development process . Following training in the method ,  DCM  is implemented via a cyclic process of briefing staff , conducting mapping observations , data analysis and report preparation , feedback to staff and action planning . Recent controlled studies of  DCM 's  efficacy have found heterogeneous results , and variability in  DCM  implementation has been indicated as a potential contributing factor . This review aim ed to examine the primary research evidence on the processes and the barriers and facilitators to implementing  DCM  as a practice development method within  formal dementia care setting s.  PUBMED , PsycINFO , CINAHL , The Cochrane Library-Cochrane review s , HMIC ( Ovid ) , Web of Science and Social Care Online were search ed using the term  "" Dementia Care Mapping ""  . Inclusion criterion was  primary research studies in any formal dementia care setting s  where  DCM  was used as a practice development tool and which included discussion /critique of the implementation processes . Assessment of study quality was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool .  Twelve papers were included in the review  ,  representing nine research studies .  The papers included discussion of various components of the  DCM  process , including  mapper selection and preparation ; mapping observations ; data analysis , report writing and feedback ;  and  action planning .  However , robust evidence on requirements for successful implementation of these components was limited . Barriers and facilitators to mapping were also discussed . The review found some consensus that  DCM  is more likely to be  successfully implemented  if the right people are selected to be trained as  mappers  , with appropriate mapper preparation and ongoing support and with effective leadership for  DCM  within the implementing organization/unit and in organizations that already have a person-centered culture or ethos . Future development of the  DCM  tool should consider ways to save on time taken to conduct DCM cycles . More research to underst and the ingredients for effective  DCM  implementation is needed."
" The findings from this review suggest that CRF is linked to immune/inflammatory , metabolic , neuroendocrine , and genetic biomarkers . We also identified gaps in knowledge and made recommendations for future research."
"eObjective : To systematic ally review the literature regarding safety of disease-modifying drug ( DMD ) use during pregnancy on perinatal and developmental outcomes in  offspring of patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .  Methods : A PubMed and EMBASE search up to February 2012 was conducted with a manual search of references from relevant articles . Selected studies were evaluated using internationally accepted criteria . Results :  Fifteen studies identified 761  interferon & bgr;-  ,  97 glatiramer acetate-  , and 35  natalizumab-exposed  pregnancies .  Study quality ranged from poor to good ; no study was rated excellent . Small sample sizes limited most studies . Compared with data for unexposed pregnancies , fair- to good- quality prospect i ve cohort studies reported that  interferon & bgr ;  exposure was associated with  lower mean birth weight , shorter mean birth length , and preterm birth  ( < 37 weeks ) , but not  low birth weight  ( <  2,500 g ) , cesarean delivery , congenital anomaly ( including malformation ) , or spontaneous abortion .  Fewer studies of fair quality were available for  glatiramer acetate  and  natalizumab .  Glatiramer acetate exposure was not associated with  lower mean birth weight , congenital anomaly , preterm birth , or spontaneous abortion .   Natalizumab  exposure did not appear to be associated with  shorter mean birth length , lower mean birth weight , or lower mean gestational age .  No studies examined   mitoxantrone  or  fingolimod  exposure  . One study of paternal DMD use during conception found no effect  on gestational age or birth weight .  Few studies examined  longer-term developmental outcomes  . Conclusion : Further studies are needed to determine the potential risks associated with preconceptional and in utero DMD exposure in  patients with MS .  Discontinuation of DMDs before conception is still recommended .

"sOBJECTIVES The aim of this review was to search existing literature to identify  comfort interventions  that can be used to assist  an adult patient to undergo complex radiotherapy requiring positional stability for periods greater than 10 min .  The objectives of this review were to ; 1 ) identify  comfort interventions  used for clinical procedures that involve sustained inactivity similar to radiotherapy ; 2 ) define characteristics of  comfort interventions  for future practice ; and 3 ) determine the effectiveness of identified comfort interventions . The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and meta-analyses statement and the Template-for-Intervention-Description- and Replication guide were used . KEY FINDINGS The literature search was performed using PICO criteria with five data bases ( AMED , CINAHL EMBASE , MEDLINE , PsycINFO ) identifying  5269 titles .  After screening ,  46 r and omised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria  . Thirteen interventions were reported and were grouped into four categories :  Audio-visual , Psychological , Physical , and Other interventions ( education/information and aromatherapy )  . The majority of  aromatherapy  , one  audio-visual  and one  educational intervention  were judged to be clinical ly significant for  improving patient comfort  based on anxiety outcome measures ( effect size ≥ 0.4 , mean change is greater than the Minimal-Important-Difference and low-risk-of-bias ) . Medium to large  effect sizes  were reported in many interventions where differences did not exceed the Minimal-Important-Difference for the measure . These interventions were deemed worthy of further investigation .  Several interventions were identified that may  improve comfort  during  radiotherapy  assisting  patients  to sustain and endure the same position over time . This is crucial for the continual growth of complex radiotherapy requiring a need for comfort to ensure stability for targeted treatment . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE Further investigation of comfort interventions is warranted , including tailoring interventions to patient choice and determining if multiple interventions can be used concurrently to improve effectiveness."

"eABSTRACT The conceptual basis of   early childhood feeding  interventions  for obesity prevention is poorly understood . The aim of this systematic review is to characterise these interventions ’ use of  behaviour change techniques ( BCTs )  and  psychological theory  , focusing on interventions delivered by healthcare professionals for  children ≤ 2 years .  We search ed  seven electronic data bases from inception to January 2019  and identified  12 trials .   BCTs  and theory use were identified using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1 and the Theory Coding Scheme respectively . Interventions used 19  BCTs  , most commonly   ‘ Instruction  on  how to perform the behaviour ’   ( 12 of 12 studies ) and   ‘ Social support   ( unspecified ) ’ ( 8 of 12 studies ) .  The mean number of BCTs  used was 5.1 . Six trials explicitly stated basing interventions on theory , most commonly   social cognitive theory  and  responsive feeding   ( 4 of 6 studies each ) . Links between theory use and BCTs were poor .  Early childhood feeding  interventions have insufficiently integrated psychological theories into their development and evaluation . We recommend greater consideration of  psychological theory  incorporating  family and systems approaches and responsive feeding  in future intervention development . Moreover , these theories should explicitly link with BCTs . These theories and BCTs should also be included in the evaluation phase."
"sPURPOSE  Cognitive alterations  are reported in  breast cancer patients receiving  chemotherapy  .  This has adverse effects on patients ' quality of life and function . This systematic review investigates the effectiveness of  pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions  to manage  cognitive alterations  associated with breast cancer treatment . METHODS Medline via EBSCO host , CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL were search ed for the period January 1999-May 2014 for prospect i ve r and omised controlled trials related to the management of chemotherapy-associated cognitive alterations  .  Included studies investigated the management of  chemotherapy-associated  cognitive alterations   and used subjective or objective measures in  patients with breast cancer during or after  chemotherapy .   Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias . RESULTS  Thirteen studies involving 1138 participants were included .  Overall , the risk of bias for the 13 studies was either high ( n=11 ) or unclear ( n=2 ) .  Pharmacologic interventions  included  psychostimulants  ( n=4 ) ,  epoetin alfa  ( n=1 ) and  Ginkgo biloba  ( n=1 ) .  Non-pharmacologic interventions  were  cognitive training  ( n=5 ) and  physical activity  ( n=2 ) . Pharmacologic agents were ineffective except for  self-reported cognitive function  in an epoetin alfa study .  Cognitive training interventions  demonstrated benefits in  self-reported cognitive function , memory , verbal function and language and orientation/attention .   Physical activity  interventions were effective in improving  executive function and self-reported concentration .   Current evidence does not favour the pharmacologic management of  cognitive alterations  associated with breast cancer treatment .  Cognitive training and physical activity interventions  appear promising , but additional studies are required to establish their efficacy . Further research is needed to overcome method ological shortfalls such as heterogeneity in participant characteristics and non-st and ardised neuropsychological outcome measures."

"gOBJECTIVE : Existing evidence of predictors of   repeated teenage pregnancy   has not been assessed rigorously . This systematic review provides a comprehensive evaluation of protective and risk factors that are associated with   repeated teenage pregnancy   through a metaanalytical consensus . DATA SOURCES : We used PubMed , EMBASE , CINAHL , ProQuest , PsychINFO , ScienceDirect , Scopus , and  Web of Science data bases from 1997–2015  and the reference list of other relevant research papers and related review s. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Eligibility criteria included (  1 ) epidemiologic studies that analyzed factors associated with repeated pregnancy or birth among adolescents < 20 years of age who were nulliparous or experienced at least 1 pregnancy , and ( 2 )  experimental  studies  with  an observational component  that was  adjusted for the intervention .  STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS : We performed narrative synthesis of study characteristics , participant characteristics , study results , and quality assessment . We also conducted r and om‐effects and quality ‐effects metaanalyses with meta‐regression to obtain pooled odds ratios of identified factors and to determine sources of between‐ study heterogeneity . RESULTS :  Twenty‐six eligible epidemiologic studies , most from the United States ( n=24 ) , showed > 47 factors  with no evidence of publication bias for each meta analysis . Use of contraception ( pooled odds ratio , 0.60 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.35–1.02 ) , particularly  long‐acting reversible contraceptives  ( pooled odds ratio , 0.19 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.08–0.45 ) , considerably reduced  repeated teenage pregnancy risk  . Among studies about contraception , the  number of follow‐up  visits ( adjusted coefficient , 0.72 ; P=.102 ) and  country  of study ( unadjusted coefficient , 2.57 ; permuted P=.071 ) explained between‐ study heterogeneity . Education‐related  factors  , which included  higher level of education  ( pooled odds ratio , 0.74 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.60–0.91 ) and  school  continuation ( pooled odds ratio , 0.53 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.33–0.84 ) , were found to be protective .  Conversely , depression  ( pooled odds ratio , 1.46 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.14–1.87 ) ,  history of abortion  ( pooled odds ratio , 1.66 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.08–2.54 ) ,  and relationship factors , such as partner  support ,  increased the repeated teenage pregnancy risk  .   :  Contraceptive use  , educational  factors  , depression , and a history of abortion  are the highly influential predictors of  repeated  teenage pregnancy  .  However , there is a lack of epidemiologic studies in  low‐  and middle‐income countries to measure the extent and characteristics  of repeated teenage pregnancy  across more varied setting."

"lBackground  Cell-free DNA  has been proposed as a means of predicting complications among  severely injured patients .  The purpose of this systematic review was to assess whether  cell-free DNA  was useful as a prognostic biomarker for outcomes in  trauma patients in the intensive care unit .  Methods We search ed Pubmed , Embase , Scopus and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials and reference lists of relevant articles for studies that assessed the prognostic value of  cell-free DNA detection  in  trauma patients in the intensive care unit .  Outcomes of interest included  survival , posttraumatic complications and severity of trauma .  Due to considerable heterogeneity between the included studies , a checklist was formed to assess quality of  cell-free DNA measurement .  Results  A total of 14 observational studies , including 904 patients , were  eligible for analysis . Ten studies were design ed as prospect i ve cohort studies ; three studies  included selected patients from a cohort  while one study was of a retrospective design . We found a significant correlation between higher  values of cell-free DNA  and  higher mortality .  This significant correlation was evident as early as on intensive care unit admission . Likewise , cell-free DNA predicted the  severity of trauma and posttraumatic complications  in a majority of patients . Conclusion The amount of cell-free DNA can function as a prognostic tool for mortality and to a lesser extent severity of trauma and posttraumatic complications . St and ardizing  cell-free DNA  measurement is paramount to ensure further research in cell-free  DNA  as a prognostic tool."
" Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains a rescue therapy . Since the year 2000 , patient treatment and practice with  ECMO  have considerably changed as the result of research findings and technological advancements over time . Over the past four decades , only four RCTs have been published that compared the intervention versus conventional treatment at the time of the study . Clinical heterogeneity across these published studies prevented pooling of data for a meta- analysis .We recommend combining results of ongoing RCTs with results of trials conducted after the year 2000 if no significant shifts in technology or treatment occur . Until these new results become available , data on use  of ECMO  in patients with acute respiratory failure remain inconclusive . For  patients with acute cardiac failure or arrest  , outcomes of ongoing RCTs will assist clinicians in determining what role  ECMO and ECPR  can play in patient care."
"sThe present systematic review with meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) aim ed to analyze the effectiveness of  omega-3 fatty acids  on the   frequency  , severity , and  duration of migraine .   This systematic review was performed by search ing several data bases for controlled clinical trials .  Of the 13 trials , five , two , and three RCTs met the eligibility criteria  to evaluate the efficacy of  omega-3  on the  frequency , duration , and severity of migraine attacks  , respectively . The  Jadad scale  was used to evaluate the risk of bias analysis . Overall estimates of the intervention effect were obtained from r and om-effect meta- analysis . The studies ’ heterogeneity was evaluated using the chi-squared test ( χ2 ) ( Cochran ’s test ( Q test ) ) and I2 Index . Potential sources of heterogeneity among the trials were investigated by meta-regression analyses . The results showed  that  omega-3 intake had  no effect on frequency  ( WMD = −0.20 ; 95%CI −0.67 , 0.27 ; P = 0.401 , and I2 = 4.6 % ;  P = 0.380 ) and severity  ( SMD = −0.59 ; 95%CI −1.85 , 0.66 ; P = 0.35 , and I2 = 88.8 % ;  P = 0.000 ) of migraine  but had  a reduction effect on the duration of migraine attacks  ( WMD = −3.44 ; 95%CI −5.70 , −1.19 ; P = 0.003 , and I2 = 0.0 % ; P = 0.926 ) . In  conclusion , omega-3 intake  leads to a significant  reduction  of approximately  3.44 hours in the duration of migraine  . Further r and omized controlled trials of high method ological quality with adequate sample sizes are required to confirm the results of the meta-analyses."

"oThe systematic review by Gupta et al. [ 1 ] tries to clarify the difficult issue of what are the best  chemotherapy  options for  patients affected by inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent or metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma .  The lack of drugs with a high response rate that significantly improve survival makes the treatment of these patients especially challenging [ 2 ] .  Doxorubicin  is the most widely accepted st and ard first-line treatment for soft-tissue sarcomas and , by extension , for uterine leiomyosarcomas [ 3 ] . However , it is still unclear if this is the optimal drug , as other agents have also proven to be active in this malignancy . Leiomyosarcomas are one of the most common subtypes within the heterogeneous group of tumours that are softtissue sarcomas [ 4 ] . They can arise from almost anywhere in the body , but limbs , gynaecological area and vessels are the most common sites of origin [ 5 ] . Although not fully confirmed in the literature , it is commonly accepted that the primary disease site plays an important role in both the  response to treatment  and  prognosis  [ 6 ] . Uterine leiomyosarcomas certainly seem to be more  chemosensitive  than those that arise from vessels . Despite this apparent heterogeneity in clinical behaviour , leiomyosarcomas have one common feature : their  poor prognosis  [ 7 ] . Not only are they incurable in the advanced setting , but the  response rates  of currently available treatments are low . One of the difficulties that has historically affected the development of successful drugs in leiomyosarcoma is clinical trial design . Due to the rarity of soft-tissue sarcomas , the classic trials included many different histological subtypes in order to achieve sufficient patient numbers and reach statistical significance . This strategy is fraught with difficulties , as soft-tissue sarcomas encompassmore than 50 different diseases with very different origins , biology , chemosensitivity and prognosis . Thus , the results from these studies are difficult to."

"sCONTEXT Currently , st and ard treatment of  metastatic prostatic cancer ( MPCa )  is  and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) .  Recent studies suggested that local treatment of MPCa is related to increase of  survival  of those patients , as observed in other tumors . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of local treatment on  overall survival and cancer specific survival  in 3 and 5 years in  patients with MPCa .  MATERIAL S AND METHODS Systematic review and meta- analysis of population studies published at PubMed , Scielo , Lilacs , Cochrane and EMBASE data bases until June 2016 . Several large cohorts and Post-Roc studies were included , that evaluated  patients with MPCa su bmi tted to  local treatment ( LT )  using radiotherapy ( RDT ) , surgery ( RP ) or brachytherapy ( BCT ) or not su  bmi  tted to local treatment ( NLT ) .  RESULTS  34.338 patients were analyzed in six included papers , 31.653 su bmi tted to NLT and 2.685 to  LT  . Overall survival  in three years was significantly higher in patients su bmi tted to LT versus NLT ( 64.2 % vs. 44.5 % ; RD 0.19 , 95 % CI , 0.17 - 0.21 ; p<0.00001 ; I²=0 % ) , as well as in five years ( 51.9 % vs. 23.6 % ; RD 0.30 , 95 % CI , 0.11 - 0.49 ; p<0.00001 ; I²=97 % ) . Sensitive analysis according to type of local treatment showed that surgery ( 78.2 % and 45.0 % ; RD 0.31 , 95 % CI , 0.26 - 0.35 ; p<0.00001 ; I²=50  % )  and radiotherapy ( 60.4 % and 44.5 % ; RD 0.17 , 95 % CI , 0.12 - 0.22 ; p<0.00001 ; I²=67 % ) presented  better outcomes   .  LT using RDT , RP or BCT  seems to significantly  improve overall survival and cancer-specific survival  of  patients with metastatic prostatic cancer .  Prospect i ve and r and omized studies must be performed in order to confirm our results."
"hBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE This systematic review analyzed studies examining the  effectiveness  of various  physical therapy interventions  for  temporom and ibular disorder .  METHODS Studies met 4 criteria : (  1 ) subjects were from 1 of 3 groups identified in the first axis of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporom and ibular Disorders , ( 2  ) the intervention was within the  realm of physical therapist practice  , ( 3 ) an experimental design was used , and ( 4 ) outcome measures assessed one or more primary presenting symptoms .  Thirty studies  were evaluated using Sackett 's rules of evidence and 10 scientific rigor criteria .  Four r and omly selected articles  were classified independently by 2 raters ( interrater agreement of 100 % for levels of evidence and 73.5 % for method ological rigor ) . RESULTS The following recommendations arose from the 30 studies : ( 1 )  active exercises  and  manual mobilizations  may be effective ; ( 2 ) postural training may be used in combination with other interventions , as independent effects of postural training are unknown ; ( 3 )  mid-laser therapy  may be more effective than other  electrotherapy  modalities  ;  ( 4 ) programs involving   relaxation  techniques and  biofeedback  ,  electromyography  training , and proprioceptive  re-education   may be more effective than  placebo treatment or occlusal splints ;  and ( 5 )  combinations of active exercises ,  manual therapy , postural correction  , and  relaxation techniques   may be effective . DISCUSSION AND  These recommendations should be viewed cautiously . Consensus on defining temporom and ibular joint disorder , inclusion and exclusion criteria , and use of reliable and valid outcome measures would yield more rigorous research."
"CPlatinum  agents such as cisplatin and carboplatin  are DNA-damaging agents with activity in breast cancer ( BC ) , particularly in the  triple negative ( TN ) subgroup .  The utility of  platinum agents  , in addition to  st and ard neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC )  , is controversial . To assess the activity of  platinum agents  in  patients with TNBC treated with  NAC   , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of all published studies . A search of PubMed , EMBASE , the Web of Science , SCOPUS , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed to identify studies that investigated  platinum-based NAC  in  patients with TNBC .  R and om effect models were adopted to estimate the summary  risk ratio  ( RR ) , and the publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger ’s regression asymmetry test . The primary endpoints were the  pooled rate of the pathologic complete response ( pCR ) and the RR to obtain a pCR  in patients treated versus not treated with  NAC containing platinum agents .   28 studies were included ( six r and omized controlled trials and 22 retrospective or prospect i ve studies ) for a total of 1,598 TNBC patients .  Overall , the  pooled rate of pCR  in patients treated with  platinum-based NAC  was 45 % . In r and omized trials ,  NAC containing cisplatin or carboplatin  significantly increased the  rate of pCR  compared with  nonplatinum agents  ( RR = 1.45 , 95 % CI 1.25–1.68 ; P < 0.0001 ) . Compared with non-TN , TNBCs were associated with a threefold increase in  the pCR rate  when treated with  platinum-based NAC  ( RR 3.32 , 95 % CI 2.39–4.61 ; P < 0.0001 ) . In conclusion ,  pCR rates  increase significantly with the addition of  cisplatin or carboplatin  in TNBC compared with  NAC containing no platinum drugs .  TN status is a predictor of benefit from platinum-based NAC."
"rPURPOSE While fatigue , sleep disturbance , and depression often co-occur in  breast cancer patients  , treatment efficacy for this symptom cluster is unknown . A systematic review was conducted to determine whether there are specific interventions  ( ie  ,  medical , pharmacological , behavioral , psychological , and complementary medicine approaches )  that are effective in mitigating the   fatigue-sleep disturbance-depression symptom cluster  in breast cancer patients  , using the Rapid Evidence Assessment of the Literature ( REAL ( © ) ) process . METHODS Peer- review ed literature was search ed across multiple data bases  ;  from data  base  inception -  October  2011 , using keywords pre-identified to capture r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) relevant to the research question . Method ological bias was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) 50 checklist .  Confidence  in the  estimate of effect  and  assessment of safety  were also evaluated across the categories of included interventions via the Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluations ( GRADE ) methodology . RESULTS The initial search yielded  531 citations , of which 41 met the inclusion criteria .  Of these ,  twelve  RCTs reported on all three symptoms , and eight of these were able to be included in the GRADE analysis . The remaining  29  RCTs reported on two symptoms . Studies were of mixed quality and many were underpowered . Overall , results suggest that there is : 1 ) promising evidence for the effectiveness of various treatment types in mitigating  sleep disturbance  in breast cancer patients ; 2 ) mixed evidence for  fatigue  ; 3 ) little evidence for treating  depression  ; and 4 ) no clear evidence that treatment of one symptom results in effective treatment for other symptoms .  More high- quality studies are needed to determine the impact of varied treatments in mitigating the  fatigue-sleep disturbance-depression symptom  cluster  in breast cancer patients .  Furthermore , we encourage future studies to examine the psychometric and clinical validity of the hypothesized relationship between the symptoms in the  fatigue-sleep disturbance-depression  symptom cluster."

( 2014 ) , The Oncologist , 19 , 251–258 . For a discussion of meta- analysis and forest plots used in oncology research , please see the related article by Joanne Lester starting on page 465 . N early  63,000 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in 2014  , with an estimated death rate  of 1,900  during this period . Differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) includes papillary , follicular and Hürthle cell histologies and accounts for greater than 90 % of all thyroid cancers ( American Cancer Society , 2014 ) . While most differentiated thyroid cancers are curable with implementation of the st and ard of care including surgery , possible radioactive iodine ( RAI ) , and thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) suppression , 10 % to 15 % of patients will have or develop disease that is RAI-refractory or nonavid ( Pacini et al. , 2012 ) . This population of patients has a poorer prognosis with an  overall survival rate  of 2.5 to 3.5 years ( Durante et al. , 2006 ) . For patients who are  refractory to RAI  and have  metastatic or recurrent disease  not  amenable  to  surgery or external-beam radiation therapy  , there has been a paucity of response to traditional chemotherapeutic agents . In this setting ,  cytotoxic agents  such as  doxorubicin  have produced insignificant improvement in  objective and subjective sequelae or overall survival benefit  ( Gottlieb et al. , 1974 ) . The shift in systemic oncologic treatment from chemotherapeutic  agents  to targeted agents has been practice -changing in a variety of he-matologic and solid tumor malignan-cies . The advent of multikinase in-hibitors ( MKIs ) that have the ability to target a variety of overexpressed mutated pathways and block angio-genesis signaling has been promising . Thyroid cancer , recognized as highly vascular , also has multiple associated somatic mutations of proto-oncogenes v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B ( BRAF ) , V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( K-Ras ) , and rearranged during transfection ( RET )."
">Introduction Evidence suggests that providing care for an  older loved one  may present a risk to the health of the  caregiver .  To underst and the link between the psychosocial stress of caregiving and damage to the health of caregivers , numerous studies have assessed the presence of inflammatory biomarkers among  caregivers .  These biomarkers are measured to underst and the relationships between the social stress of caregiving and the health of  caregivers .  Objective To provide a complete summary of the current literature regarding the most clinical ly relevant pro-inflammatory biomarkers associated with caregiving . Methods We search ed  articles in MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 1980 to 30 April 2016  for all studies that assessed biomarkers  ( cortisol , interleukin-6  and  c-reactive protein )  among  caregivers of community-dwelling older persons .  The quality of the selected studies was assessed by two review ers using the STROBE or CONSORT checklist . Results  Twenty-four studies were included .  Most of the studies were cross-sectional and focused on  dementia caregiving .  Increases in biomarkers were associated with problems such as  disturbed sleep , burden or pain and caregiving characteristics  , including  daily stressors  and the  duration of caregiving .   Cognitive-behavioural therapy  and participation in leisure  activities  were associated with significantly lower  levels of cortisol and IL-6  , respectively . Discussion We found little evidence concerning the association between caregiving status and  biomarkers of stress and inflammation .  We discuss potential sources of bias and suggest some directions for further research . This stress model can be exp and ed by taking into account the positive aspects of caregiving and the potential re sources of  caregivers ."

"mPURPOSE To identify and systematize the main studies on the  transition from  enteral to oral feeding  in preterm infants .  RESEARCH STRATEGY Articles that describe the  transition from  oral to enteral feeding  in preterm infants  were located in MEDLINE , LILACS , and SciELO data bases . SELECTION CRITERIA Original studies , with available abstract , published in the last 10 years were included . DATA ANALYSIS Analysis of the methodology and the main results of the studies , and meta- analysis of the effects of  sensory-motor-oral stimulation  at the time of transition to full oral feeding and duration of hospitalization were conducted . RESULTS  Twenty-nine national and international publications  were considered . Most studies were clinical trials ( 44.8 % ) and did not use  rating scales  to start the transition process ( 82.7 % ) . In the meta- analysis , positive effect  of stimulation of the sensory-motor-oral system  was observed with respect to the  transition time to oral diet  ( p=0.0000 ) , but not in relation to the  length of hospital stay  ( p=0.09 ) . However , heterogeneity between studies was found both in the analysis of the  transition time  to  full oral feeding  ( I2=93.98 ) and in the  length of hospital stay  ( I2=82.30 ) .  The transition to oral feeding is an important moment , and various physical and clinical characteristics of  preterm infants  have been used to describe this process . Despite the impossibility of generalizing the results due to the heterogeneity of the studies , we have noted the importance of strategies for stimulation of sensory-motor-oral system to decrease the period of transition to full oral feeding system."
"nINTRODUCTION Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a serious global health problem .  CYD-TDC ( Dengvaxia ® )  was the first vaccine to gain regulatory approval to try and address this problem . AIM Summarize all available evidence on the immunogenicity , efficacy and safety of the  CYD-TDV dengue vaccine .  METHOD Meta- analysis and systematic review . RESULTS The best and worst  immunogenicity  results were for DENV4 and DENV1 , respectively .  Vaccine efficacy  of 60 % was derived from studies with  participants aged 2 - 16 years old  , with DENV4 and DENV2 presenting the best and worst results , respectively .  Erythema and swelling  were more frequent with CYD-TDV . No differences were detected for  systemic adverse events  .   CYD-TDV  showed moderate efficacy in  children and adolescents .  From the immunogenicity results in adults , we can expect satisfactory efficacy from vaccination in this population."

This systematic review comprehensively summarizes the available epidemiologic and r and omized controlled trial evidence investigating the role of  exercise  in the management of cancer . Literature search es focused on determining the potential impact of  exercise  on 1 )  cancer mortality and recurrence  and 2 )  adverse effects of cancer and its treatment .  A total of  100 studies were review  ed involving thous and s of  individual patients whose  exercise behavior  was assessed following the diagnosis of any type of cancer .  Compared with patients who performed  no/less exercise  , patients who  exercised  following a diagnosis of cancer were observed to have a lower  relative risk of cancer mortality and recurrence  and experienced fewer/less  severe adverse effects .  The findings of this review support the view that  exercise  is an important adjunct therapy in the management of cancer . Implication s on cancer care policy and practice are discussed."
"sNeonatal  hypothermia  is an important risk factor for  mortality and morbidity  , and is common even in temperate climates . We conducted a systematic review to determine whether  plastic coverings  , used immediately following delivery , were effective in reducing  the incidence of mortality , hypothermia and morbidity  .  A total of 26 studies ( 2271 preterm and 1003 term neonates ) were included .  Meta-analyses were conducted as appropriate .  Plastic wraps  were associated with a  reduction in hypothermia  in  preterm  ( ⩽29 weeks ; risk ratio (RR)=0.57 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.46 to 0.71 ) and  term  neonates ( RR=0.76 ; 95 % CI 0.60 to 0.96 ) . No significant  reduction in neonatal mortality or morbidity  was found ; however , the studies were underpowered for these outcomes . For neonates , especially preterm ,  plastic wraps  combined  with  other environmental heat sources are effective in  reducing  hypothermia during stabilization and transfer within hospital . Further research is needed to quantify the effects  on  mortality or morbidity , and investigate the use  of plastic coverings  outside hospital setting s or without additional heat sources."
"  Long-term iron  supplementation appears to result in  improved iron status  and  a reduction in iron deficiency and anemia  in  preterm and LBW infants .  However , high- quality evidence regarding the long-term effects of supplementation on functional health outcomes is lacking . Iron overload has largely been ignored . Well- design ed , long-term , dose-response RCTs are required to ascertain the optimal dose and delivery method for the provision of dietary iron in preterm  infants  , with consideration of short- and long-term health effects .

" All the interventions discussed in this review can reduce the  symptoms of UNS .  However  , TENS , optokinetic stimulation , somatosensory electrostimulation , mirror therapy and virtual reality training  seem to be the most effective treatment methods ( d > 0,80 ) . Future research should focus on producing studies of higher method ological quality with larger sample sizes."
" as it is shown by the numerous studies in the field , the application of VR has a positive impact on the  rehabilitation  of the most predominant  geriatric  syndromes . The level of  realism  of the virtual stimuli seems to have a crucial role in the training of cognitive abilities . Future research needs to improve study design by including larger sample s , longitudinal design s , long term follow-ups , and different outcome measures , including  functional and quality of life indexes  , to better evaluate the clinical impact of this promising technology in healthy old subjects and in neurological patients."
"sNutrition research is struggling to demonstrate beneficial health effects , since nutritional effects are often subtle and long term . Health has been redefined as the ability of our body to cope with daily-life challenges . Physiology acts as a well-orchestrated machinery to adapt to the continuously changing environment . We term this adaptive capacity “ phenotypic flexibility . ” The phenotypic flexibility concept implies that health can be measured by the ability to adapt to conditions of temporary stress , such as physical exercise , infections or mental stress , in a healthy manner . This may offer a more sensitive way to assess changes in health status of healthy  subjects  . Here , we performed a systematic review of  61 studies applying different  nutritional stress tests   to quantify  health   and  nutritional health  effects  , with the objective to define an  optimal nutritional stress test  that has the potential to be adopted as the golden st and ard in nutrition research . To acknowledge the multi-target role of nutrition , a relevant subset of 50 processes that govern optimal health , with high relevance to diet , was used to define phenotypic flexibility . Subsequently , we assessed the response of  biomarkers  related to this subset of processes to the different challenge tests . Based on the obtained insights , we propose a  nutritional stress test  composed of a  high-fat , high-caloric drink  ,  containing 60 g palm olein , 75 g glucose and 20 g dairy protein  in a total volume of 400 ml . The use of such a st and ardized  nutritional challenge  test in intervention studies is expected to demonstrate subtle improvements of  phenotypic  flexibility , thereby enabling substantiation of nutritional health effects."
" This review provides limited evidence that  interventions aim ed at communities to inform and educate about early childhood vaccination  may improve  attitudes towards vaccination  and probably increase  vaccination uptake  under some circumstances . However , some of these interventions may be re source intensive when implemented on a large scale and further rigorous evaluations are needed . These interventions may achieve most benefit when targeted to areas or groups that have low childhood vaccination rates .."
" This review highlights a paucity of data on the use of  BMP  in fracture healing as well as considerable industry involvement in currently available evidence . There is limited evidence to suggest that  BMP  may be more effective than controls for acute tibial fracture healing , however , the use of  BMP  for treating nonunion remains unclear . The limited available economic evidence indicates that  BMP  treatment for acute open tibial fractures may be more favourable economically when used in patients with the most severe fractures."
"tCaregivers are healthcare assets because they care for patients at home ; however , when clinicians focus solely on patients , caregivers ' needs may not be recognized . The purpose of this scoping literature review is to identify the burdens on  caregivers of people with Parkinson 's disease .  CINAHL and PubMed data bases were search ed to locate  thirteen original articles  , one systematic review , and one meta- analysis within the last five years that highlighted caregivers ' burdens . Results indicate the need to identify practical interventions that decrease  caregivers ' physical , psychological , and socioeconomic burdens .  Correlates of Parkinson  's  caregiver   burdens are not clearly available .  Caregivers '  context ual demographic information is missing , as is an underst and ing of how caregivers negotiate day-to-day caregiving activities . Gaps exist about how caregivers reconcile multiple medications and manage rehabilitation needs of the patient at home . A recommendation for practice is a systematic evaluation of the caregivers ' capacity at the time of clinic visit."
"LMost  children  are surviving  acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL )  today . Yet , the emergence of cardiometabolic comorbidities in this population may impact long-term outcomes including the  quality of life  and  lifespan .  Obesity is a major driver of cardiometabolic disorders in the general population , and in ALL patients it is associated with increased risk of  hypertension  ,  dysglycemia  , and  febrile neutropenia  when compared with lean ALL patients undergoing therapy . This systematic review aims to assess the current evidence for  bariatric interventions  to manage  obesity  in  children with ALL .  The primary outcome for this systematic review was the  change in BMI z-score  with implementation of the interventions studied . Literature search es were conducted in several data bases . Ten publications addressing the study question were included in this review , and five studies were used in the meta- analysis to assess the impact of the  bariatric interventions  on  obesity .  The  BMI z-score  did not change significantly with the interventions . However , the  quality of evidence  was low , which precluded the recommendation of their use . In conclusion , prospect i ve , rigorous , adequately powered , and high- quality longitudinal studies are urgently needed to deliver effective lifestyle  interventions  to  children with ALL  to treat and prevent obesity . These interventions , if successful , may improves  cardiometabolic health outcomes  and  enhance  the  quality of life and life expectancy  in children with ALL."
"sPURPOSE To systematic ally evaluate and quantify the effects of  Tai Chi/Qigong ( TCQ )  on  motor ( UPDRS III , balance , falls , Timed-Up- and -Go , and 6-Minute Walk )  and  non-motor ( depression and cognition ) function  , and  quality of life ( QOL )  in  patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) .  METHODS A systematic search in  7 electronic data bases targeted clinical studies evaluating  TCQ  for individuals with PD published through August 2016 .  Meta- analysis was used to estimate effect sizes ( Hedges 's g ) and publication bias for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Method ological bias in RCTs was assessed by two raters . RESULTS Our search identified  21 studies , 15 of which were RCTs with a total of 735 subjects .  For RCTs , comparison groups included no treatment ( n = 7 , 47 % ) and active interventions ( n = 8 , 53 % ) . Duration of   TCQ   ranged from 2 to 6 months . Method ological bias was low in 6 studies , moderate in 7 , and high in 2 . Fixed-effect models showed that  TCQ  was associated with significant improvement on  most motor outcomes ( UPDRS III  [ ES = -0.444 , p < 0.001 ] ,  balance  [ ES = 0.544 , p  < 0.001  ] ,  Timed-Up- and -Go  [ ES = -0.341 , p =  0.005  ] ,  6 MW  [ ES = -0.293 , p =  0.06  ] ,  falls  [ ES = -0.403 , p =  0.004  ] ,  as well as depression  [ ES = -0.457 , p = 0.008 ] and  QOL  [ ES = -0.393 , p < 0.001 ] ,  but not cognition  [ ES = -0.225 , p = 0.477 ] ) . I2 indicated limited heterogeneity . Funnel plots suggested some degree of publication bias .  Evidence to date supports a potential benefit of  TCQ  for improving  motor function , depression and QOL  for individuals with PD , and vali date s the need for additional large-scale trials."
"eBackground / Aims : To assess the efficacy of intravesical  hyaluronic acid ( HA ) and HA/chondroitin sulfate ( CS ) instillation  in  patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome  by systematic review and meta- analysis . Methods : A systematic literature search was performed using the keywords  : ‘ interstitial cystitis ' or ‘ painful bladder syndrome ' or ‘ bladder pain syndrome ' and ‘   hyaluronic acid  '   , up to March 31 ,  2016  . The primary outcome was  visual analogue scale related pain symptom ( VAS ) .  Secondary outcomes were the  O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index ( ICSI ) and Problem Index ( ICPI ) , frequency , nocturia , bladder volume , and voided urine volume .  Results :  Ten articles involving 390 patients  were retrieved and assessed in analysis . A significant improvement in  mean VAS  on fixed-effect and r and om-effect models ( mean difference [ MD ] -3.654 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -3.814 to -3.495 , and MD -3.206 , 95 % CI -4.156 to -2.257 , respectively ) was found . Significant improvements were found in  the ICSI  ( MD -3.223 , 95 % CI -4.132 to -2.315 ) and  ICPI  ( MD -2.941 , 95 % CI -3.767 to -2.116 ) . Similarly , the  other  outcomes were significantly improved . Conclusion : Intravesical  HA and HA/CS  instillation  improved pain symptom , quality of life , and other outcomes  and could be included as therapeutic modality of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome."
" Online interventions  are a promising strategy for the care of  people with dementia  . It would be advisable to perform further r and omized trials to assess the reasons for lack of adherence to intervention , as well as usability studies to test the different software programs used."
" In summary , little evidence exists for the positive effects of  case  conferences   in the care of  people with dementia .  This review highlights the need for method ologically well- design ed intervention studies to provide conclusive evidence of the effects of case conferences."
"sEnvironmental , or  ' choice-architecture ' , interventions  aim to change behaviour by changing properties/contents of the environment and are commonly used in the workplace to promote healthy behaviours  in employees .  The present review aim ed to evaluate and synthesize the evidence surrounding the effectiveness of  environmental interventions  targeting  eating behaviour  in the  workplace  . A systematic search identified  8157 articles , of which 22 were included in the current review .  All included studies were coded according to risk of bias and reporting quality and were classified according to the emergent typology of  choice-architecture interventions .  More than half of included studies ( 13/22 ) reported significant changes in  primary measures of eating behaviour ( increased fruit/veg consumption , increased sales of healthy options and reduction in calories purchased )  . However , only one study produced a small significant improvement in  weight/body mass index .  Many studies had a high or unknown risk of bias ; reporting of interventions was suboptimal ; and the only trial to measure compensatory behaviours found that intervention participants who ate less during the intervention  ate more out with the workplace  later in the day . Hence , we conclude that more rigorous , well-reported studies that account for compensatory behaviours are needed to fully underst and the impact of  environmental interventions  on diet and importantly on  weight/body mass index  outcomes."
 Future research should focus on the effectiveness of components of multi-faceted programmes and their  cost effectiveness  and include qualitative data to better target interventions for behavioural and psychological symptoms . It is important to consider family carer readiness to use  non-pharmacological strategies  and to develop a shared language about the inherent needs and communications of behavioural and psychological symptoms.
" Based on limited evidence , we can not recommend a specific drug for the treatment of  fatigue  in palliative care patients .  Fatigue  research in palliative care seems to focus on modafinil and methylpheni date , which may be beneficial for the treatment of  fatigue  associated with palliative care although further research about their efficacy is needed .  Dexamethasone , methylprednisolone , acetylsalicylic acid , armodafinil , amantadine and L-carnitine  should be further examined . Consensus is needed regarding  fatigue outcome parameters  for clinical trials."
"dINTRODUCTION  Benign  Paroxysmal  Positional Vertigo  is highly prevalent in  elderly people .  This condition is related to vertigo , hearing loss , tinnitus , poor balance , gait disturbance , and an increase in risk of falls , leading to postural changes and quality of life decreasing . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the outcomes obtained by clinical trials on the effectiveness of  Otolith Repositioning Maneuver and Vestibular Rehabilitation exercises  in the treatment of  Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo in elderly .  METHODS The literature research was performed using PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science and PEDro data bases , and included r  and omized  controlled clinical trials  in English , Spanish and Portuguese , published during January 2000 to August 2016 .  The method ological quality of the studies was assessed by PEDro score and the outcomes analysis was done by critical revision of content . RESULTS Six studies were fully review ed . The  average age of participants ranged between 67.2 and 74.5 years .  The articles were classified from 2 to 7/10 through the PEDro score . The main outcome measures analyzed were  vertigo , positional nystagmus and postural balance .  Additionally , the  number of maneuvers necessary for remission of the symptoms , the quality of life , and the functionality  were also assessed . The majority of the clinical trials used  Otolith Repositioning Maneuver  ( n=5 ) and 3 articles performed  Vestibular Rehabilitation exercises in addition to Otolith Repositioning Maneuver or pharmacotherapy .  One study showed that the addition of movement restrictions after maneuver did not influence the outcomes .  There was a trend of improvement in Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo symptomatology in  elderly patients who  underwent Otolith Repositioning Maneuver .   There is sparse evidence from method ologically robust clinical trials that examined the effects of  Otolith Repositioning Maneuver and Vestibular Rehabilitation exercises  for treating Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo in the elderly . R and omized controlled clinical trials with comprehensive assessment of symptoms , quality of life , function and long-term follow up are warranted."
" :  Individualized multicomponent psychosocial interventions  following residential care placement may be beneficial in  improving family carers ’ role overload , psychological distress and guilt  . Group interventions may also  improve feelings of guilt and sadness  . There is insufficient evidence that  individualized or group  interventions  improve carer depression , burden or satisfaction  . However , due to substantial heterogeneity between studies and method ological flaws , the grade of this evidence is very low . Further high quality RCTs that include different groups of carers are recommended . Comparative effects of  individualized versus group interventions  should be examined as these are likely to have cost implication."
"nBACKGROUND  Exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) analysis  is a simple non-invasive technique that allows repeated collection of breath sample s with a minimum of inconvenience for the subject . These breath sample s can potentially indicate lung disease activity and given the ease of collection ,  EBC  is becoming a useful research tool in the study of respiratory diseases . It has the potential to be used in both population -based studies and in the context of  pediatric asthma  it may prove useful in diagnosis and monitoring . METHODS A systematic review was conducted to identify studies of   EBC markers   in  childhood asthma .  RESULTS Most of the studies were cross-sectional in design , and the results suggest that simple chemical entities such as hydrogen ions ( as pH ) , hydrogen peroxide , and oxides of nitrogen are associated with pediatric allergic asthma and exacerbations . In addition , more complex molecules including leukotrienes , prostagl and ins , and cytokines such as the  interleukins IL-4 and IL-5  are also elevated in the breath of those with asthma .   EBC  has the potential to aid diagnosis , and to evaluate the inflammatory status of  asthmatic children .  Future studies may be able to refine further how best to collect EBC sample s , to interpret them , and the technique has the potential to allow repeated sampling which will allow studies of natural history , pathogenesis and response to treatment to be undertaken."
"dThis work provides a systematic review of all published r and omised , controlled clinical trials ( RCT ) investigating the effects of  n-3 PUFA intake  on the prevention and treatment of  non-neurodegenerative neuropsychiatric disorders .  Five data bases ( PubMed , EMBASE , LILACS , CINAHL and The Cochrane Data base ) were search ed for RCT in this area published up to April 2011 . The selected studies all  involved human participants and included a comparison group . Thirty eight studies were identified  , which examined the influence of  n-3 PUFA supplementation  on the  prevention/treatment of depression  ( non-perinatal ) ( n 23 ) ,  perinatal depression  ( n 6 ) and  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD )  ( n 9 ) . Great heterogeneity was noticed in terms of study design , the doses of  n-3 PUFA  administered , and study duration . Some benefit was noted with respect to the treatment of  hyperactivity and depression  in over half the examined studies , although the evidence was not conclusive . For any firm conclusions to be drawn , further studies will be needed that take into account the initial n-3 PUFA status of the subjects . Excessive  n-3 PUFA  intakes might be associated with a  greater risk of peroxidation events and therefore neuropsychiatric deterioration .  Indeed , some studies only recorded benefits when lower doses were administered . It is therefore important that the dose required to achieve any potential benefit be determined."
" Evidence from 19 trials assessing different types of  dietary advice  for  women with GDM  suggests no clear differences for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes assessed using GRADE , except for a possible reduction in  caesarean section  for women receiving a  DASH diet  compared with a  control diet .  Few differences were observed for secondary outcomes .Current evidence is limited by the small number of trials in each comparison , small sample sizes , and variable method ological quality . More evidence is needed to assess the effects of different types of dietary  advice  for  women with GDM .  Future trials should be adequately powered to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes."
" In  patients with cardiovascular disease  ,  influenza vaccination  may reduce  cardiovascular mortality  and combined  cardiovascular events .  However , studies had some risk of bias , and results were not always consistent , so additional higher- quality evidence is necessary to confirm these findings . Not enough evidence was available to establish whether  influenza vaccination  has a role to play in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease."
"yIn this paper we review the associations between   maternal and child undernutrition  with human  capital and risk of adult diseases  in low-income and middle-income countries .  We analysed  data  from  five long-st and ing prospect i ve cohort studies from Brazil , Guatemala , India , the Philippines , and South Africa  and  noted  that indices of maternal and child  undernutrition  ( maternal height , birthweight , intrauterine growth restriction , and weight , height , and body-mass index at 2 years according to the new WHO growth st and ards ) were related to adult outcomes ( height , schooling , income or assets , offspring birthweight , body-mass index , glucose concentrations , blood pressure ) . We undertook systematic review s of studies from  low-income and middle-income countries  for these outcomes and for indicators related to  blood lipids , cardiovascular disease , lung and immune function , cancers , osteoporosis , and mental illness .  Undernutrition was strongly associated , both in the review of published work and in new analyses , with  shorter adult height , less schooling , reduced economic productivity , and --for women -- lower offspring birthweight .  Associations with adult disease indicators were not so clear-cut .  Increased size at birth and in childhood  were positively associated with  adult body-mass index  and to a lesser extent with  blood pressure values  , but not with  blood glucose concentrations .  In our new analyses and in published work ,  lower birthweight and undernutrition  in childhood were risk factors for  high glucose concentrations , blood pressure , and harmful lipid profiles  once adult body-mass index and height were adjusted for , suggesting that rapid postnatal weight gain -- especially after infancy -- is linked to these conditions . The review of published works indicates that there is insufficient information about long-term changes in  immune function , blood lipids , or osteoporosis indicators . Birthweight  is positively associated with lung  function  and with the incidence of some cancers , and undernutrition could be associated with mental illness . We noted that height-for-age at 2 years was the best predictor of human capital and that undernutrition is associated with lower  human  capital . We conclude that damage suffered in early life leads to permanent impairment , and might also affect future generations . Its prevention will probably bring about important  health , educational ,  and  economic  benefits . Chronic diseases are especially common in undernourished children who experience rapid  weight gain  after infancy."
" Exposure to inhaled allergens , ETS , unflued heaters and poor air quality has an important effect  on exacerbations  in  young children with asthma  and should be minimised or , ideally , avoided . Better underst and ing of the effect of exposure to damp housing , air conditioning and dietary factors plus interactions between environmental exposures associated  with  exacerbations is required."
" : Despite disparities in how health and  wellness coaching  have been operationalized previously , this systematic review observes an emerging consensus in what is referred to as  health and wellness coaching ;  namely , a patient-centered process that is based upon behavior change theory and is delivered by health professionals with diverse background s. The  actual coaching  process entails goal - setting determined by the patient , encourages self-discovery in addition to content education , and incorporates mechanisms for developing accountability in health behaviors . With a clear definition for  health and wellness coaching  , robust research can more accurately assess the effectiveness of the approach in bringing about changes in  health behaviors , health outcomes and associated costs  that are targeted to reduce the global burden of chronic disease."
" : The pregnancy and postpartum period presents a unique opportunity to engage women in interventions to help  optimize lifestyle behaviors for weight management  , however the optimal approach is unclear . Improving consistency in intervention implementation and reporting will improve future evidence synthesis."
" In  CPAP-naive people with severe sleep apnoea  , low- quality evidence indicates that supportive interventions that encourage people to continue to use their CPAP machines increase usage compared with usual care . Moderate- quality evidence shows that a  short-term educational intervention  results in a modest increase in  CPAP usage  . Low- quality evidence indicates that  behavioural therapy  leads to a large increase in  CPAP machine usage  . The impact of improved CPAP usage on  daytime sleepiness , quality of life and long-term cardiovascular risks  remains unclear . For outcomes reflecting machine usage , we down grade d for risk of bias and inconsistency . An additional limitation for  daytime sleepiness and quality of life measures  was imprecision . Trials in people who have struggled to persist with treatment are needed , as currently little evidence is available for this population . Optimal timing and duration and long-term effectiveness of interventions remain uncertain . The relationship between improved  machine  usage and effect  on symptoms and quality of life  requires further assessment . Studies addressing the choice of interventions that best match individual patient needs and therefore result in the  most successful and cost-effective therapy  are needed."
" With new studies included since the last version of this review , which included  adults and children  , this up date d meta- analysis in  adults with asthma  showed that tailoring asthma medications based on  FeNO  levels ( compared with primarily on clinical symptoms ) decreased the  frequency of asthma exacerbations  but did not impact on  day-to-day clinical symptoms , end-of- study FeNO levels , or inhaled corticosteroid dose .  Thus , the universal use of FeNO to help guide therapy in  adults with  asthma can not be advocated . As the main benefit shown in the studies in this review was a reduction  in asthma exacerbations  , the intervention may be most useful in adults who have frequent exacerbations . Further RCTs encompassing different  asthma  severity , ethnic groups in less affluent setting s , and taking into account different FeNO cutoffs are required."
" A wide range of interventions and exposures were identified , but the efficacy of many strategies remains unproven due to the high risk of bias present in many studies . Reducing dehydration prevalence in  long-term care facilities  is likely to require multiple strategies involving policymakers , management , and care staff , but these require further investigation using more robust study method ologies .

"gNeoadjuvant  treatment  in  non-metastatic pancreatic cancer ( PaC  ) has the theoretical advantages of downstaging the tumor , sterilizing any present systemic undetectable disease , selecting patients for surgery and administering therapy to each patient . The aim of this systematic review is to analyze the state of the art on  neoadjuvant protocol s  for  non-metastatic PaC.  A literature search over the last 10 years was conducted , and papers had to be focused on  resectable , borderline resectable ( BLR ) or locally advanced ( LA ) histo- or cytologically proven PaC ;  to be prospect i ve studies or prospect ively collected data bases ; to report percentage of protocol achievement and survival data at least in an intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis . Twelve studies were eligible for systematic review .  Studies included a total of 624 patients : 248 resectable , 268 BLR , 71 LA and 37 non-specified .  All studies were included for meta- analysis .  ITT overall survival  ( OS ) was 16.7 months ( 95 % CI 15.16–18.26 months ) ; for resected patients OS was 22.78 months ( 95 % CI 20.42–25.16 ) , and for eventually non-resected patients it was 9.89 months ( 95 % CI 8.84–10.96 ) .  Neoadjuvant approaches  for resectable , BLR and LA PaC are spreading . Outcomes tend to be better outside an RCT context , but strong evidence s are lacking . Actually such treatments should be performed only in a r and omized clinical trial setting."
"tNot all  patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD )  benefit from treatment with  systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics .  The aim of the study was to identify criteria recommended in current COPD guidelines for treating acute exacerbations with  systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics  and to assess the underlying evidence . Current COPD guidelines were identified by a systematic literature search . The most recent guidelines as per country/organisation containing recommendations about treating acute exacerbations of COPD were included . Guideline development and criteria for treating acute exacerbations with  systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics  were appraised . R and omised controlled trials directly referred to in context with the recommendations were evaluated in terms of study design , setting , and study population . A  total  of  19 COPD guidelines were included .   Systemic corticosteroids  were often universally recommended to all  patients with acute exacerbations .  Criteria for treatment with  antibiotics  were mainly an increase  in respiratory symptoms . Objective diagnostic tests  or  clinical examination  were only rarely recommended . Only few criteria were directly linked to underlying evidence , and the  trial  patients represented a highly specific group of  COPD patients .  Current COPD guidelines are of little help in primary care to identify  patients with acute exacerbations  probably benefitting from treatment with  systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics  in primary care , and might contribute to overuse or inappropriate use of either treatment."
" Obesity is an under-reported predictor of inferior response to  anti-TNF  agents in  patients with select immune-mediated inflammatory diseases .

"eOBJECTIVE To review common  complementary and alternative treatment modalities  for the treatment of  persistent musculoskeletal pain in older adults .  METHODS A critical review of the literature on  acupuncture and related modalities , herbal therapies , homeopathy  , and  spinal manipulation  was carried out . Review included  678 cases within 21 r and omized trials and 2 systematic review s of  herbal therapies :  798 cases within 2 systematic review s of  homeopathy  ; 1,059 cases within 1 systematic review of  spinal manipulation  for low back pain , and 419 cases within 4 r and omized controlled trials for neck pain .  The review of  acupuncture  and related modalities was based upon a paucity of well-controlled studies combined with our clinical experience . RESULTS Insufficient experimental evidence exists to recommend the use of traditional Chinese acupuncture over other modalities for  older adults with persistent musculoskeletal pain .  Promising preliminary evidence exists to support the use of  percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation  for persistent low back pain . While some herbals appear to have  modest analgesic benefits  , insufficient evidence exists to definitively recommend their use . Drug-herb interactions must also be considered . Some evidence exists to support the  superiority  of  homeopathic remedies  over  placebo  for treating  osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis .  The  benefits  of   spinal manipulation   for  persistent low back and neck pain  have not been convincingly shown to outweigh its risks . DISCUSSION While the use of complementary and alternative modalities for the treatment of persistent musculoskeletal pain continues to increase , rigorous clinical trials examining their efficacy are needed before definitive recommendations regarding the application of these modalities can be made."
"DBACKGROUND  People with intellectual disabilities ( ID )  experience more health problems and have different lifestyle change needs , compared with the general population . AIMS To improve  lifestyle change interventions  for people  with ID  , this review examined how  behaviour change  techniques  ( BCTs )  were applied in interventions aim ed at physical activity , nutrition or physical activity and nutrition , and described their quality . METHODS AND PROCEDURES After a broad search and detailed selection process ,  45 studies were included in the review .  For coding BCTs , the CALO-RE taxonomy was used . To assess the quality of the interventions , the  Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro  ) scale was used . Extracted data included general study characteristics and intervention characteristics . OUTCOMES AND RESULTS All interventions used  BCTs  , although theory-driven BCTs were rarely used . The most frequently used BCTs were  ' provide information on consequences of behaviour in general '  and  ' plan social support/social change '  . Most studies were of low quality and a theoretical framework was often missing .  AND IMPLICATION S This review shows that  BCTs  are frequently applied in lifestyle change interventions . To further improve effectiveness , these lifestyle change interventions could benefit from using a theoretical framework , a detailed intervention description and an appropriate and reliable intervention design which is tailored to people with ID."
" Sham-controlled RCTs have found no benefits of  acupuncture  relative to a credible sham  acupuncture  control for  IBS symptom severity or IBS-related quality of life .  In comparative effectiveness Chinese trials , patients reported greater benefits from  acupuncture  than from two  antispasmodic drugs ( pinaverium bromide and trimebutine maleate )  , both of which have been shown to provide a modest benefit for IBS . Future trials may help clarify whether or not these reportedly greater benefits of  acupuncture  relative to  pharmacological therapies  are due entirely to patients ' preferences for  acupuncture  or greater expectations of improvement on  acupuncture  relative to drug therapy."

The literature search retrieved  102 studies published before July 2005 ;  after additional h and search ing of conference proceedings ,  13 full-text articles and 13 abstract s met the  inclusion  criteria  . The review ers extracted the key characteristics of each of the economic evaluations , and all studies received a grade in five categories to summarise the quality of the study : methodology , transparency , sensitivity , relevance and overall score . The current economic literature is predominantly focused on identifying the  short-term direct cost of glaucoma  treatment , particularly the precise quantification of glaucoma drug costs . Using the European and US treatment guidelines as a benchmark , it is evident that the current body of literature does not satisfy the needs of decision-makers , although certain studies provide some valuable information , which is a step towards reaching this goal .The main method ological issue in the economic models is an absence of a clinical ly relevant  long-term effectiveness measure  , or where this measure is produced , there is a lack of transparency and validation of the methods used . More attention needs to be given to modelling the consequences of treatment , and those consequences should include  patient compliance , control of intraocular pressure and progression of visual field deficit  , since these drive both the costs and the overall outcomes .We recognise that constructing the ‘ ideal ’ clinical outcome measure represents a major challenge to research ers . As such , we have outlined a modelling framework that could be used to produce the required level of economic evidence , and ongoing clinical research ( such as the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial ) could provide the vali date d link between  intraocular pressure and disease progression  , which forms an essential part of such models."
" Implication s for practice Based on low quality evidence , the addition of  interferon  to  first-line chemotherapy  did not alter the  overall survival  in  post-surgical women with advanced EOC  compared with  chemotherapy  alone . There is low quality evidence to suggest that  interferon  in combination with  chemotherapy  worsened the  progression free survival  in post-surgical women with advanced EOC compared with  chemotherapy  alone . There is not enough evidence that  interferon therapy  alone alters  overall survival or progression free survival  compared to observation alone in  post-surgical women who have undergone first-line chemotherapy .  IMPLICATION S FOR RESEARCH Three of the five trials included in this review were stopped early and were , therefore , underpowered to detect any true effect of the intervention . The trials did not report the results of important outcomes in a uniform manner , preventing statistical aggregation of the results . Trial methodology was poorly reported result ing in unclear risk of bias . For clear recommendations to be made regarding the effectiveness of  interferon  in the treatment of advanced EOC , long-term , well conducted and adequately powered RCTs would be needed . However , the available data do not suggest that  interferon  has an adequately advantageous effect to warrant further investigation."
" Patients who  receive electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training   after  stroke are more likely to improve their  generic activities of daily living .  Paretic arm function may also improve , but not  arm muscle strength  . However , the results must be interpreted with caution because there were variations between the trials in the duration and amount of training , type of treatment , and in the patient characteristics."
"sThis study analyzed the evidence available in the literature concerning the effectiveness of different  active cutaneous warming systems  to prevent   intraoperative hypothermia .   This is a systematic review with primary studies found in the following data bases : CINAHL , EMBASE , Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and Medline . The sample comprised  23 r and omized controlled trials .  There is evidence in the literature indicating that the circulating water garment system is the most  effective  in  maintaining patient body temperature .  These results can support nurses in the decision-making process concerning the implementation of effective measures to maintain  normothermia  , though the decision of health services concerning which system to choose should also take into account its cost-benefit status given the cost related to the acquisition of such systems."
"dBackground There is lack of uniformity in the utilization of  peritoneal cytology  in  gastric cancer  management . The identification of intraperitoneal free cancer cells ( IFCCs ) is believed to confer poor prognosis . However , while some of these patients are palliated , others may undergo more aggressive therapies . In this review , we aim ed to identify and synthesize findings on the use of  peritoneal cytology  in predicting  peritoneal recurrence and overall survival  in  curative gastric cancer patients .  Methods Electronic literature search es were conducted using Medline , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1 , 1998 to December 31 , 2009 . We determined the  accuracy ,  sensitivity , and specificity of  peritoneal cytology  in predicting  peritoneal recurrence  based on four techniques —  conventional cytology , immunoassay , immunohistochemistry  , and  reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .   Recurrence rates and overall survival rates  for curative patients were determined , based on positivity or negativity for IFCCs . Results  Twenty-eight articles were included .  All four techniques showed wide variations in  accuracy , sensitivity , and specificity  in predicting  peritoneal recurrence . Recurrence rates  for patients positive for IFCCs ranged from 11.1 to 100 % , while those negative for IFCCs had recurrence rates of 0–51 % .  Overall survival  was significantly reduced for patients with positive IFCCs . Short follow-up periods and possible duplication of results may limit result interpretation . Conclusion The presence of IFCCs appears to increase the  risk of peritoneal recurrence  and is associated with worse  overall survival  in  gastric cancer patients .  Further incorporation of  peritoneal cytology  in clinical decision-making in gastric cancer depends on the development of a consistently accurate and rapid IFCC detection method."
"  Psychological interventions  appear to be effective in improving  survival  at 12 months but not at longer-term follow-up , and they are effective in  reducing psychological symptoms  only in some of the outcomes assessed in  women with metastatic breast cancer .  However , findings of the review should be interpreted with caution as there is a relative lack of data in this field , and the included trials had reporting or method ological weaknesses and were heterogeneous in terms of interventions and outcome measures."
"eINTRODUCTION In some cases , conservative treatment of  internal derangements of the Temporom and ibular Joint ( TMJ )  is considered little responsive . Thus , it is necessary to accomplish treatments that aim at reducing  pain  and  improve function  in  patients who present arthrogenic temporom and ibular disorders .  OBJECTIVE This study , by means of a systematic review of the literature , aim ed to analyze the  effectiveness  of  intra-articular injections with corticosteroids and sodium hyaluronate  for treating internal derangements of the TMJ . METHODS Carry out a research in the following data bases : MEDLINE , Cochrane , EMBASE , Pubmed , Lilacs , and BBO , considering  publications issued between 1966 and October 2010  , focusing on r and omized or quasi-r and omized controlled clinical trials , single or double-blind . RESULTS After applying the inclusion criteria we collected  9 articles  , 7 of which were  r and omized controlled double-blind clinical trials  and  2 r  and omized controlled single-blind clinical trials .  After analyzing the literature , it was found that intra-articular injection with  corticosteroids and sodium hyaluronate  seems to be an effective method for treating internal derangements of the TMJ . However , further r and omized controlled clinical trials , with representative sample s and longer follow-up time must be carried out in order to assess the real effectiveness of this technique."
" Published data suggest a 59 % relative reduction in NMIBC  recurrence  when  C-HT  is compared with  MMC alone  .  C-HT  also appears to improve  bladder preservation rate .  However , due to a limited number of r and omized trials and to heterogeneity in study design , definitive conclusions can not be drawn . In the future ,  C-HT  may become st and ard therapy for  high-risk patients with recurrent tumors  , for  patients who are unsuitable for radical cystectomy  , and in cases for which bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment is contraindicated."
" Addition of low-dose  glucocorticoids  to  csDMARD  therapy produces benefits in  early RA .  Under tight control conditions , combination therapy with  csDMARDs  is no better than  MTX  monotherapy . Tofacitinib is a new DMARD with proven efficacy."
" To conclude , although no consensus existed regarding the best approach to assess  DASH compliance  , its suboptimal compliance warrants attention . This study implied a need to investigate effective approaches to sustain the  DASH  dietary  pattern  beyond counselling alone."
 There were insufficient data to establish whether oral EPA was better than  placebo .  Comparisons of  EPA combined  with a  protein energy supplementation  versus a  protein energy supplementation ( without EPA )  in the presence of an appetite stimulant ( Megestrol Acetate ) provided no evidence that  EPA  improves symptoms associated with the cachexia syndrome often seen in patients with advanced cancer.
"eObjective : This study was to investigate the effectiveness of  action observation therapy  on  arm and h and motor function , walking ability , gait performance , and activities of daily living  in  stroke patients .  Design : Systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials . Data sources : Search es were completed in January 2019 from electronic data bases , including PubMed , Scopus , the Cochrane Library , and OTseeker . Review methods : Two independent review ers performed data extraction and evaluated the study quality by the PEDro scale . The pooled effect sizes on different aspects of outcome measures were calculated . Subgroup analyses were performed to examine the impact of stroke phases on  treatment efficacy  . Results : Included were  17 articles with 600 patients .  Compared with control treatments , the  action observation therapy  had a moderate effect size  on arm and h and motor outcomes  ( Hedge ’s g = 0.564 ; P < 0.001 ) , a moderate to large effect size  on walking outcomes  ( Hedge ’s g = 0.779 ; P < 0.001 ) , a large effect size  on gait velocity  ( Hedge ’s g = 0.990 ; P < 0.001 ) , and a moderate to large effect size on  activities of daily function  ( Hedge ’s g = 0 . 728 ; P = 0.004 ) . Based on subgroup analyses , the action  observation therapy  showed moderate to large  effect  sizes in the studies of  patients  with acute/subacute stroke or those with chronic stroke ( Hedge ’s g = 0.661 and 0.783 ) . Conclusion : This review suggests that  action observation therapy  is an effective approach for  stroke patients  to improve arm and h and motor function , walking ability , gait velocity , and daily activity performance."
"nAdipose  tissue-derived stem cells ( ASCs )  in the form of  stromal vascular fraction ( SVF )  and  cultured expansion  have been applied in clinical setting s in some countries to treat  osteoarthritis ( OA ) of knees  , one of the most common debilitating , incurable disorders . Since the first report of successful  cartilage-like tissue regeneration  with  autologous adipose SVF containing ASCs  , there has been a gradual increase in the number of publications confirming such results . Thus far , most of the reports have been limited to treatments of OA of knees . Recently , successful applications of  adipose SVF  in treating OA of ankles and hips have been reported . In addition , several groups have reported modified methods of applying  adipose SVF  , such as combining bone marrow stimulation with adipose SVF or adding additional extracellular matrix ( ECM ) in treating OA . Here , we present an up date d , systematic review of  clinical effectiveness and safety  in treating  OA of knees , ankles , and one hip since 2016  using  ASCs in the form of adipose SVF or in cultured expansion  , along with a description and suggestion of potential biological mechanisms of cartilage regeneration."
" Variation in outcome measurement and long-term follow up has hampered the ability of RCTs to contribute data on important outcomes for CP , result ing in lost opportunities to measure the impact of maternal and neonatal interventions . There is an urgent need for and long-term follow up of these interventions and an agreed set of st and ardised and clinical ly relevant common data elements for study end-points."
 Technology-mediated MHIS  for the  treatment of depression  has a consistent  positive  overall effect compared to controls . A total of 15 components have been identified . Further studies are needed to quantify the impact of individual components on treatment effects and to identify further components that are relevant for the design of future  technology-mediated  interventions for the treatment of depression and other mental disorders.
 More research is needed to determine whether routine inclusion of reproductive intention screening in primary care is warranted.
"hRecent controversy regarding the ethics of conducting   airway research  in patients  led to disagreements concerning the value and frequency of manikin-based investigation . However , no formal examination of the methodology of airway research has been undertaken . We , therefore , performed a systematic bibliometric review of  airway management research  to describe the conduct , quantify the subjects ( patient vs. manikin vs. other ) , assess the reported outcomes and map global trends .  We retrieved 1505 relevant studies published between 2006 and 2017 , together recruiting 359,648 subjects , of which 341,233 were patients , the remaining being volunteers or subjects managing  manikins  , human  cadavers  , animals or bench models .  There were 701 r and omised controlled clinical trials ( 46.6 % ) , 83 non-r and omised experimental clinical trials ( 5.5 % ) , 298 observational studies ( 19.8 % ) and 423 non-patient studies ( 28.1 % ) . A total of  1082 studies  ( 71.9 % ) were patient studies and 322 were manikin studies ( 21.4 % ) . The total  annual number of airway management studies  increased over time , as did the annual number of patient studies , but there was no significant increase in the annual number of manikin studies over time . Of the patient studies , subject baseline characteristics were most likely to be  ASA status 1 - 2  (  n = 531  , 49.1  % )  ,  population  s were most often  elective surgical patients  ( n = 918 , 84.8  %  ) and the most common interventions studied were tracheal intubation ( n = 820 , 54.4 % ) or supraglottic airway device insertion ( n = 257 , 17.1 % ) . There was a total of 77 different primary outcomes used in the included studies , the most commonly reported being  success rate and procedure time .  By underst and ing how and what has been previously studied these data can be used to form the basis for future priority setting exercises , core outcome set development , and could inform strategy on the future directions of airway management research."
"1BACKGROUND A potential mechanism of action of  manual therapy  is the activation of a sympathetic-excitatory response . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of  joint  mobilisation on changes in clinical manifestations of sympathetic nervous system activity . DATA SOURCES MEDLINE , EMBASE , AMED , CINAHL , EBSCO , PubMed , PEDro , Cochrane Collaboration Trials Register , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s and SCOPUS data bases . STUDY SELECTION R and omised controlled trials that compared a  mobilisation technique  applied to the spine or the extremities with a  control  or  placebo .  DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS Human studies collecting data on  skin conductance or skin temperature  were used . Data were extracted by two review ers . Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane guidelines , and quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach . St and ardised  mean  differences (  SMD )  and r and  om effects  were calculated . RESULTS  Eighteen studies were included in the review and 17 were included in the meta- analysis .  The meta- analysis found a significant increase in  skin conductance  [ SMD 1.21 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.88 to 1.53 , n=269 ] and a  decrease in temperature  ( SMD 0.92 , 95 % CI -1.47 to -0.37 , n=128 ) after mobilisation compared with the control group . An increase in  skin conductance  ( SMD 0.73 , 95 % CI 0.51 to 0.96 , n=293 ) and a  decrease in temperature  ( SMD -0.50 , 95 % CI -0.82 to -0.18 , n=134 ) were seen after mobilisation compared with placebo . The risk of bias was generally low , but the heterogenicity of the results down grade d the level of evidence . LIMITATIONS Most trials ( 14/18 ) were conducted on  asymptomatic healthy subjects .   There is moderate evidence suggesting a  sympatho-excitatory effect  of joint mobilisation . Systematic Review Registration Number PROSPERO CRD42018089991."
"  Immunogenicity  was significantly different between  RA patients and healthy controls  for the H1N1 strain , but not for the H3N2 or B strains .  Adverse event rates  were higher in  RA  patients .  Adjuvant  and special kinds of  immunosuppressive biologics  may play an important role in immunogenicity of inactivated influenza vaccines for RA patients."
" Higher protein intake ( ≥ 3.0 g/kg/d but < 4.0 g/kg/d ) from formula  accelerates weight gain .  However , limited information is available regarding the impact of higher formula protein intake on long-term outcomes such as  neurodevelopmental abnormalities .  Available evidence is not adequate to permit specific recommendations regarding the provision of very high protein intake ( > 4.0 g/kg/d ) from formula during the initial hospital stay or after discharge."
 This review highlights the lack of evidence for the provision of  dietary advice  in the management of illness-related malnutrition . The available data suggest that  oral nutritional supplements  have a greater role than dietary advice in the improvement of  body weight and energy intake .  A large adequately powered r and omised controlled trial is needed to compare the efficacy of different forms of therapy to increase dietary intake in people with illness-related malnutrition and to examine the impact of this on clinical function and survival.
"dABSTRACT Drawing from goal setting theory ( Latham & Locke , 1991 ; Locke & Latham , 2002 ; Locke et al. , 1981 ) , the purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of  multi-component goal setting interventions  for changing   physical activity ( PA ) behaviour .   A literature search  returned 41,038 potential articles .  Included studies consisted of controlled experimental trials wherein  participants  in  the intervention conditions set PA goals and their PA behaviour was compared to participants in a control group who did not set goals .  A meta- analysis was ultimately carried out across  45 articles ( comprising 52 interventions , 126 effect sizes , n = 5912 )  that met eligibility criteria using a r and om-effects model . Overall , a medium , positive effect ( Cohen 's d(SE ) = .552(.06 ) , 95 % CI = .43–.67 , Z = 9.03 , p < .001 ) of goal setting interventions in  relation to PA behaviour  was found . Moderator analyses across 20 variables revealed several noteworthy results with regard to features of the  study  ,  sample characteristics , PA goal content  , and  additional goal -related behaviour change techniques  . In conclusion ,  multi-component goal setting interventions  represent an  effective  method  of fostering PA  across a diverse range of population s and setting s. Implication s for effective goal setting interventions are discussed."
" Lung deposition  was lower than 20 % of nominal dose delivered with nebulizers and mostly occurred in proximal airways . Further studies are needed to link substantial  concentrations of antibiotics  in infected pulmonary fluids to  pulmonary deposition .  The administration technique  with nebulizers  should be improved in  ventilated patients  in order to ensure an efficient but safe , feasible and reproducible technique."
"sBACKGROUND The beneficial effects of  cardiac rehabilitation ( CR )  have been challenged in recent years and there is now a need to investigate whether current  CR  programmes , delivered in the context of modern cardiology , still benefit  patients .  METHODS A systematic review of non-r and omised controlled studies was conducted . Electronic search es of Medline , Embase , CINAHL , science citation index ( web of science ) , CIRRIE and Open Grey were undertaken . Non-r and omised studies investigating the effects of  CR  were included when recruitment occurred from the year 2000 onwards in accordance with significant CR guidance changes from the late 1990 's .  Adult patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infa rct ion ( AMI ) were included . Non-English articles were considered .  Two review ers independently screened articles according to pre-defined selection criteria as reported in the PROSPERO data base ( CRD42015024021 ) . RESULTS Out  of 2,656 articles , 8 studies involving 9,836 AMI patients were included . Studies were  conducted  in 6 countries .   CR  was found to reduce  the risk of all-cause and cardiac-related mortality and improve Health-Related Quality of Life ( HRQOL )  significantly in at least one domain . The benefits of  CR  in terms of  recurrent MI  were inconsistent and no significant effects were found regarding  re-vascularisation or re-hospitalisation  following AMI .  Recent observational evidence draws different conclusions to the most current review s of trial data with respect to  total mortality and re-hospitalisation  , question ing the representativeness of historic data in the modern cardiological era . Future work should seek to clarify which patient and service level factors determine the likelihood of achieving improved all-cause and cardiac mortality and reduced hospital re-admissions."
" At best there was ' low level ' evidence for the effectiveness of  outpatient  MD rehabilitation   in improving  active function and impairments  following BoNT for upper limb spasticity in  adults  with chronic stroke . No trials explored the effect of MD  rehabilitation  on  ' passive function ' ( caring for the affected limb  ) ,  caregiver burden  , or the individual 's priority goals for treatment . The optimal types ( modalities , therapy approaches , setting s ) and intensities of therapy for improving  activity ( active and passive function )  in  adults and children with post-stroke spasticity  , in the short and longer term , are unclear . Further research is required to build evidence in this area."
"sObjective . The aim of this study was to establish guidelines for the optimization of  biologic therapies  for  health professionals involved in the management of patients with RA , AS and PsA.  Methods . Recommendations were established via consensus by a panel of experts in rheumatology and hospital pharmacy , based on analysis of available scientific evidence obtained from four systematic review s and on the clinical experience of panellists . The  Delphi method  was used to evaluate these recommendations , both between panellists and among a wider group of rheumatologists . Results . Previous concepts concerning better management of  RA , AS  and  PsA  were review ed and , more specifically , guidelines for the optimization of biologic  therapies  used to treat these diseases were formulated . Recommendations were made with the aim of establishing a plan for when and how to  taper biologic treatment  in patients with these diseases . Conclusion . The recommendations established herein aim not only to provide advice on how to improve the  risk : benefit ratio and efficiency  of such treatments , but also to reduce variability in daily clinical practice in the use of biologic  therapies  for rheumatic diseases."
" Supplementation reduces the  risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy  but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear . Implementation of  iron supplementation  recommendations may produce heterogeneous results depending on the population s ' background risk for low birthweight and anaemia , as well as the level of adherence to the intervention."
"dPurpose  Drug-induced sedation endoscopy ( DISE ) classification systems  have been used to assess anatomical findings on  upper  airway obstruction , and decide and plan surgical treatments and act as a predictor for surgical treatment outcome for  obstructive sleep apnoea management .  The first objective is to identify if there is a universally accepted  DISE  grading and classification system for analysing  DISE  findings . The second objective is to identify if there is one   DISE   grading and classification treatment planning framework for deciding appropriate surgical treatment for  obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) .  The third objective is to identify if there is one  DISE grading and classification treatment outcome framework  for determining the likelihood of success for a given OSA surgical intervention . Methods A systematic review was performed to identify new and significantly modified  DISE classification systems :  concept , advantages and disadvantages . Results Fourteen studies proposing a new  DISE classification system  and three studies proposing a significantly modified  DISE classification  were identified . None of the studies were based on r and omised control trials . Conclusion  DISE  is an objective method for visualising upper airway obstruction . The classification and assessment of clinical findings based on  DISE  is highly subjective due to the increasing number of  DISE  classification systems . Hence , this creates a growing divergence in surgical treatment planning and treatment outcome . Further research on a universally accepted objective   DISE  assessment  is critically needed."
"dMalnutrition is common in  heart failure ( HF )  , and it is associated with higher hospital readmission and mortality rates . This review aims to answer the question whether  nutritional interventions  aim ing to  increase protein and energy intake  are effective at improving outcomes for  patients with HF who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition or cachexia .  Systematic search es of four data bases ( Medline , Embase , CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ) were conducted on 21 June 2019 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) or other interventional studies using protein or energy supplementation for  adult HF patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition or cachexia  were included . Two independent review ers assessed study eligibility and risk of bias . Five studies ( four RCTs and one pilot RCT ) met the inclusion criteria . The majority of studies were small and of limited quality . The  pooled weighted mean difference ( WMD ) for body weight  showed a benefit from the nutritional intervention by 3.83 kg ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.17 to 7.50 , P = 0.04 ) from three trials with no significant benefit  for triceps skinfold thickness  ( WMD = − 2.14 mm , 95 % CI − 9.07 to 4.79 , P = 0.55 ) from two trials . The combination  of personalized nutrition intervention with conventional treatment  led to a  decrease in all-cause mortality and hospital readmission  in one study . Findings of this review suggest that  nutritional interventions  could  potentially improve outcomes  in  HF patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition .  However , the strength of the evidence is poor , and more robust studies with a larger number of participants are needed."
" The addition of  anti-leukotrienes  to  ICS  is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in  the need for rescue oral corticosteroids or hospital  admission compared to the same or an increased dose of ICS in  children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma .  Although anti-leukotrienes have been licensed for use in children for over 10 years , the paucity of paediatric trials , the absence of data on  preschoolers  , and the variability in the reporting of relevant clinical outcomes considerably limit firm conclusions . At present , there is no firm evidence to support the  efficacy  and safety of anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to ICS as a step-3 option in the therapeutic arsenal for children with uncontrolled asthma symptoms on low-dose ICS."
"sAbstract This article focuses on the impact of increased duration of  exercise therapy  on   functional recovery  after stroke .  A comprehensive literature search using multiple data bases was used to identify all relevant  r and omized controlled trials .  Their quality was review ed by two independent assessors , and a narrative systematic review and meta- analysis was completed . Method ological quality of  all the 20 r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) identified had a median of 6 points ( range 5–8 ) on the 10-point PEDro scale .  A meta- analysis was completed for studies that had a common outcome measure . For each outcome measure , the estimated effect size ( ES ) and the summary effect size ( SES ) were expressed as st and ardized mean differences ( SMD ) . The results of the meta- analysis demonstrated that  increased duration of  exercise therapy  time has  a  small but positive effect on activities of daily living  as  measured by the Barthel Index  ( SES 0.13 ; CI 0.01–0.25 ; Z = 2.15 ; p = .03 ) and that these improvements are maintained over a 6-month period ( SES 0.15 ; CI 0.05–0.26 ; Z = 2.8 ; p = .00 ) . Pooling reported differences in the various upper and lower extremity outcome measures demonstrated no significant SESs . However , the meta- analysis is supportive of the hypothesis that additional , focused exercise on the lower extremity has a  favourable  effect  on lower extremity impairment and walking speed  . The narrative review raises a number of issues that need to be considered in the development of future RCTs."
"dABSTRACT Target audience ratings of the likely impact of persuasive messages , known as perceived message effectiveness ( PME ) , are commonly used in health communication campaigns . However , applications of PME rely on a critical assumption — that is , that PME is a valid indicator of the likely effectiveness of messages . To examine the evidence supporting this assumption , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of longitudinal studies in the  tobacco education campaigns literature . Six longitudinal studies  examining the predictive validity of  PME  met inclusion criteria . Results indicated that PME ratings were significantly associated with the majority of outcomes studied . In fact , each of the six studies found PME to be associated with at least one outcome , and across the six studies , PME was associated with  message recall , conversations about ads , beliefs about smoking and quitting smoking , quit intentions , and cessation behavior .  Meta-analyses demonstrated that PME predicted  quit intentions  ( r = .256 , p < .001 ) and  cessation behavior  ( r = .201 , p < .001 ) , revealing effects that were small to medium in magnitude . Our results suggest that PME provides some predictive value as to the likely  effectiveness  of messages , although additional work using different validation design s , with other health behaviors , and among other population s is needed."
" Based on the available evidence , the addition of  esophagectomy  to  chemoradiotherapy  in locally  advanced esophageal squamous  cell carcinoma , provides little or no difference  on overall survival  , and may be associated with  higher treatment-related mortality  . The addition of esophagectomy probably  delays locoregional relapse  , however , this end point was not well defined in the included studies . It is undetermined whether these results can be applied to the treatment of  adenocarcinomas  ,  tumors involving the distal esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction  , and to people with poor response to chemoradiation."

"dIntroduction  Informal caregivers  are important re sources for  community-dwelling frail elderly .  But caring can be challenging . To be able to provide long-term care to the elderly , informal caregivers need to be supported as well . The aim of this study is to review the current best evidence on the effectiveness of different types of  support services  targeting  informal caregivers of community-dwelling frail elderly .  Methods A systematic literature search was performed in Medline , PsychINFO , Ovid Nursing Data base , Cinahl , Embase , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and British Nursing Index in september 2010 . Results Overall , the effect of  caregiver support interventions  is small and also inconsistent between studies .  Respite care  can be helpful in  reducing depression , burden and anger .  Interventions at the individual caregivers ’ level can be beneficial in  reducing or stabilizing depression , burden , stress and role strain .  Group support has a positive effect on  caregivers ’ coping ability , knowledge , social support and reducing depression .   Technology-based interventions  can reduce  caregiver burden , depression , anxiety and stress  and  improve the caregiver ’s coping ability .  Conclusion  Integrated support packages  where the content of the package is tailored to the individual  caregivers ’  physical , psychological and social needs should be preferred when supporting  informal caregivers of frail elderly .  It requires an intense collaboration and coordination between all parties involved."
" In conclusion , there is moderate to high quality evidence that both  lipid-based nutrient supplements  and  blended foods  are effective in treating  children with MAM .  Although  lipid-based nutrient supplements ( LNS )  led to a clinical ly significant benefit in the  number of children recovered  in comparison with  blended foods  , LNS did not reduce  mortality , the risk of default or progression to SAM .  It also induced  more vomiting .   Blended foods  such as  CSB++  may be equally  effective and cheaper  than  LNS .  Most of the research so far has focused on industrialised foods , and on short-term outcomes of MAM . There are no studies evaluating interventions to improve the  quality of the home diet  , an approach that should be evaluated in setting s where food is available , and nutritional education and habits are the main determinants of malnutrition . There are no studies from Asia , where moderate acute malnutrition is most prevalent."
"sBACKGROUND Nutrition plays a fundamental role in  fetal growth and birth outcomes .  OBJECTIVE We synthesized effects of  dietary interventions  before or during  pregnancy on neonatal and infant outcomes .  DESIGN R and omized controlled trials that assessed the whole  diet  or dietary  components  and  neonatal or infant outcomes  were included . Two authors independently identified articles to be included and assessed the method ologic quality . A meta- analysis was conducted separately for each outcome by using a r and om-effects model . Results were reported by dietary intervention as follows : 1 )  counseling , 2 ) food and fortified food products  , or 3 )  a combination ( counseling plus food ) intervention  , and 4 )  collectively for all dietary interventions .  Results were subanalyzed by the nutrient of interest , country income , and BMI . RESULTS Of  2326 abstract s screened , a total of 29 r and omized controlled trials ( 31 publications ) were included  in this review .  Food and fortified food products  were effective in increasing  birth weight  [ st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) : 0.27 ; 95 % CI : 0.14 , 0.40 ; P < 0.01 ] and reducing the  incidence of low birth weight  ( SMD : -0.22 ; 95 % CI : -0.37 , -0.06 ; P < 0.01 ) . All  dietary  interventions and those focused on macronutrient intake also increased  birth weight  ( P < 0.01 ) and  length  ( P < 0.05 ) and reduced the incidence of  low birth weight  ( P < 0.01 ) .  Dietary interventions  in low-income countries and underweight or nutritionally at-risk population s increased  birth weight  ( P < 0.05 ) and reduced the incidence of  low birth weight  ( P = 0.01 ) . No effects were seen for the following other outcomes :  placental weight , head circumference , macrosomia , Apgar score , small for gestational age , large for gestational age , and perinatal mortality .   Additional high- quality r and omized controlled trials that test different dietary interventions are required to identify maternal diet intakes that optimize neonatal and infant outcomes."
"lBackground There is a significant public health burden associated with  substance use in Canada .  The early detection and /or treatment of risky substance use has the potential to dramatically improve outcomes for those who  experience harms from the non-medical use of psychoactive substances , particularly adolescents  whose brains are still undergoing development . The  Screening , Brief Intervention , and Referral to Treatment model  is a comprehensive , integrated approach for the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for  individuals experiencing substance use-related harms  , as well as those who  are at risk  of  experiencing such harm  . Methods This article describes the protocol for a systematic review of the  effectiveness  of brief  interventions  as part of the  Screening , Brief Intervention , and Referral to Treatment model  for reducing the non-medical use of psychoactive substances . Studies will be selected in which brief interventions target non-medical psychoactive substance use ( excluding alcohol , nicotine , or caffeine )  among those 12 years and older who are opportunistically screened and deemed at risk of harms related to psychoactive substance use .  We will include  one-on-one verbal interventions and exclude non-verbal brief interventions (  for example ,  the provision of information such as a pamphlet or online interventions )  and  group interventions .  Primary , secondary and adverse outcomes of interest are prespecified . R and omized controlled trials will be included ; non-r and omized controlled trials , controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series design s will be considered in the absence of r and omized controlled trials . We will search several bibliographic data bases ( for example , MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , PsycINFO , CORK ) and search sources for grey literature . We will meta-analyze studies where possible . We will conduct subgroup analyses , if possible , according to drug class and intervention setting . Discussion This review will provide evidence on the  effectiveness of brief interventions  as part of the  Screening , Brief Intervention  , and  Referral  to Treatment protocol aim ed at the non-medical use of psychoactive substances and may provide guidance as to where future research might be most beneficial."
"rABSTRACT Objectives :  Assistive technology ( AT )  may enable  people with dementia  to live safely at home for longer , preventing care home admission . This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of  AT  in improving the  safety  of   people  with dementia living in the domestic setting  , by search ing for r and omised controlled trials , non-r and omised controlled trials and controlled before-after studies which compared  safety AT with treatment as usual .  Measures of safety include  care home admission ; risky behaviours , accidents and falls at home ; and numbers of deaths .  The review up date s the safety aspect of Fleming and Sum 's 2014 systematic review . Method :  Seven bibliographic data bases , the Social Care Institute for Excellence website and the Alzheimer 's Society website  were search ed for published and unpublished literature between  2011–2016  . Search terms related to AT , dementia and older people . Common outcomes were meta-analysed . Results :  Three r  and  omised controlled trials  were identified  , including 245 people with dementia .  No significant differences were found between intervention and  control  groups in  care home admission  ( risk ratio 0.85 95 % CI [ 0.37 , 1.97 ] ; Z = 0.37 ; p = 0.71 ) . The  probability of a fall occurring  was 50 % lower in the intervention group ( risk ratio 0.50 95 % CI [ 0.32 , 0.78 ] ; Z = 3.03 ; p = 0.002 ) . One included study found that a  home  safety  package containing AT  significantly  reduced risky behaviour and accidents  ( F(45 ) = 4.504 , p < 0.001 ) . Limitations include the few studies found and the inclusion of studies in English only . Conclusion : AT 's effectiveness in decreasing care home admission is inconclusive . However , the AT items and packages tested  improved safety  through reducing falls risk , accidents and other risky behaviour."
" Interventions using delivery methods varying from traditional counseling to computers achieved moderate to strong  efficacy  and merit replication . Survivor needs related to transition to adult-oriented health care and school reentry were not addressed by existing interventions . This review also revealed the absence of  health behavior interventions  for  survivors  in  middle childhood and late adolescence  . Intervention formats that are  cost-effective  and reduce participant burden should be prioritized for further testing . To broaden the reach and appeal of interventions , alternative delivery methods , such as  mobile phone software applications  , should be evaluated."

"yThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of  omega-3 supplementation  for the prevention of  recurrent preterm birth ( PTB  )   in  asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous PTB .  We search ed  fish oil , long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids , pregnancy , and omega-3  in MEDLINE , OVID , Scopus , Clinical Trials.gov , the PROSPERO International Prospect i ve Register of Systematic Review s , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception of each data base to December 2014 with no limit for language . In addition the reference lists of all identified articles were examined to identify studies that were not captured by electronic search es . We performed a meta analysis of r and omized controlled trials  of asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous PTB who were assigned r and omly to  prophylactic omega-3 supplementation vs control ( either placebo  or no  treatment )  .  The primary outcome was predefined as  PTB at < 37 weeks of gestation .  The pooled results were reported as relative risk ( RR ) with 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . The protocol of this review was registered with PROSPERO ( registration number : CRD42015016371 ) .  Two r and omized controlled trials that included 1080 women  were  analyzed  . The  mean gestational age  at r and omization was approximately 134 days in both groups ( mean difference , 0.01 days ; 95 % CI , -0.13 to 0.14 ) . Women who  received omega-3  had similar  rates of PTB  at < 37 weeks of gestation ( 34.5 % vs 39.8 % ; RR , 0.81 ; 95 % CI , 0.59 - 1.12 ) and PTB at < 34 weeks of gestation ( 12.0 % vs 15.4 % ; RR , 0.62 ; 95 % CI , 0.26 - 1.46 ) compared with control subjects . The  omega-3  groups had a statistically significantly  longer latency  ( mean difference , 2.10 days ; 95 % CI , 1.98 - 2.22 ) and  higher birthweight  ( mean difference , 102.52 g ; 95 % CI , 20.09 - 184.95 ) compared with control subjects ; the other secondary outcomes ( which included  gestational age at delivery , spontaneous PTB at < 37 and 34 weeks of gestation , admission to the intensive care unit , intraventricular hemorrhage , necrotizing enterocolitis , sepsis , and perinatal death )  were similar  . Omega-3 supplementation  during pregnancy does not prevent recurrent  PTB  in asymptomatic singleton gestations with previous PTB . The benefits in longer  latency  and higher  birth weight  may deserve further study."
" Compared with the absolute scale , the relative scale captures more effectively the variation in  the  effects  of  β2-agonists  on exercise-induced FEV1-declines  . The absolute scale has been used in the  analysis of  FEV1 changes and may have led to sub-optimal statistical analysis in some cases . The choice between the absolute and relative scale should be determined based on biological reasoning and empirical testing to identify the scale that leads to lower heterogeneity."

"nIt has not been adequately evaluated whether the outcome of infections differs by body-weight category . We performed a systematic review of relevant studies .  Eleven studies  ( one retrospective and 10  prospect i  ve cohort studies  )  were included in this review , involving  a total of 3159 hospitalized patients or nursing home residents .  Most studies ( 6/11 ) referred to lower respiratory tract infections . Seven studies showed an association of  patient outcome ( mortality  in 6/7 studies ) with body-weight category . This was shown in multivariate analysis in 4/5 studies that reported relevant data . Obese or morbidly obese patients with infections had  worse outcome  compared with the rest of the patients or with normal-weight patients , in 4/7 studies that reported relevant data ; findings were not significant in the remaining three studies . Patients in the lowest body mass index ( BMI ) group had  worse outcome  compared with all other groups combined , in 3/5 studies that reported relevant data ; findings were not significant in the remaining two studies .  Low BMI  was associated with  worse outcome  in  patients with  lower  respiratory  tract infections   in 3/4 relevant studies . Although not consistently reported , an association of both ends of the  BMI  distribution with  worse outcome of infections  is plausible and merits further investigation."
"7OBJECTIVE To provide an evidence -based assessment of metabolic  syndrome  ,  hypertension  , and hyperlipidemia in  first-degree relatives of women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) .  DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis . SETTING Not applicable . PATIENT(S )  Mothers , fathers , sisters , and brothers of women with and without PCOS .  INTERVENTION(S ) An  electronic-based search  with the use of PubMed from 1960 to June 2015 and cross-checked references of relevant articles . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S )  Metabolic syndrome , hypertension and dyslipidemia , and surrogate markers , including systolic blood pressure ( BP ) , diastolic BP , total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and triglycerides .  RESULT ( S )  Fourteen of 3,346 studies were included  in the meta-  analysis .  Prevalence of the following was significantly increased in  relatives of women with PCOS :   metabolic syndrome  ( risk ratio [ RR ] 1.78 [ 95 % confidence interval 1.37 , 2.30 ] in mothers , 1.43 [ 1.12 , 1.81 ] in fathers , and 1.50 [ 1.12 , 2.00 ] in sisters ) ,  hypertension  ( RR 1.93 [ 1.58 , 2.35 ] in fathers , 2.92 [ 1.92 , 4.45 ] in sisters ) ,  and dyslipidemia  ( RR 3.86 [ 2.54 , 5.85 ] in brothers and 1.29 [ 1.11 , 1.50 ] in fathers ) . Moreover ,  systolic BP  ( mothers , sisters , and brothers  ) , total cholesterol  ( mothers and sisters  ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  ( sisters )  , and triglycerides  ( mothers and sisters ) were significantly higher in first-degree relatives of PCOS prob and s than in controls .  ( S ) Our results show evidence of clustering for  metabolic syndrome , hypertension  , and dyslipidemia in mothers , fathers , sisters , and brothers of women with PCOS .

"sCONTEXT  Acupressure  is a noninvasive strategy used to manage various symptoms . OBJECTIVES The purpose of this article was to review r and omized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of  acupressure  for the management of symptoms . METHODS A literature search was conducted in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , Medline , and PubMed using the key words  acupressure  , clinical trial , human , and /or r and omized . R and omized clinical trials published between January 1 , 2000  and  January 31 , 2010 , which used  acupressure  as the sole intervention for one group , were included when they were written in English and when there were four or more studies of the efficacy of  acupressure  for that particular symptom . RESULTS  Forty-three studies were included in this review .  Investigators in 16 of 23 studies concluded  acupressure  was effective , primarily for the management of  nausea and vomiting  in  patients during pregnancy and during chemotherapy .  Investigators in nine of 10 studies concluded that  acupressure  was effective for  pain  in  patients with dysmenorrhea  , during labor and after trauma . Investigators of four studies concluded that  acupressure  was effective in the  management  of  dyspnea  and investigators in six studies concluded that  acupressure  was effective in  improving fatigue and reducing insomnia  in a  variety of population  s. However , evaluation of the r and omized controlled trial reports indicated a significant likelihood of bias .   Acupressure  may be a useful strategy for the management of multiple symptoms in a variety of patient  population  s , but rigorous trials are needed . Inclusion of  acupressure  as an intervention may improve patient outcomes."
"yPurpose The therapy with  m and ibular advancement devices ( MADs )  represents a treatment option for  patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) .  The literature does not provide evidence regarding the most effective  m and ibular advancement ;  therefore , the aim of this systematic review with meta-regression was to investigate the effectiveness of different  m and ibular advancement amounts  in reducing   apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI )  in OSA patients .  Methods An electronic search was performed in MEDLINE , Cochrane Data base , Google Scholar Beta , ISI Web of Knowledge , Scopus , and LILACS to select r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating the efficacy of  MADs  in reducing   AHI  in adult OSA patients . Inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of OSA and  success evaluation performed with a polysomnography , follow-up of maximum 12 months , and protrusion amount reported as a percentage of the maximum  m and  ibular advancement . The  quality of evidence  was evaluated using the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) methodology  . The  success rate  of each study was computed : [ ( mean AHI at baseline-mean AHI after treatment)/mean AHI at baseline ] . Results Thirteen RCTs performing advancements from 50 to 89 % of maximum m and ibular protrusion were included . The meta-regression analysis showed that advancement amounts higher than 50 % do not significantly influence the  success rate  ( Q = 0.373 , p = 0.541 ) . According to the  GRADE score system  , the  quality of evidence  result ed to be moderate  .  Conclusion The  AHI improvement  result ed to be not proportional to the m and ibular advancement increase . It is plausible that the success of the therapy is influenced by a combination of variables that need closer study."
"yIn  advanced pancreatic cancer  , level one evidence has established a significant survival advantage with  chemotherapy  , compared to best supportive care . The treatment-associated  toxicity  needs to be evaluated . This study examines the secondary outcome measures for  chemotherapy   in advanced pancreatic cancer  using meta-analyses . A systematic review was undertaken employing Cochrane methodology , with search of data bases , conference proceedings and trial registers . The secondary end points were  progression-free survival (PFS)/time to progression ( TTP )  ( summarised using the  hazard ratio (  HR  ) ) , response rate and toxicity  ( summarised using relative risk ) . There was no significant advantage of  5FU  combinations vs  5FU  alone for  TTP  ( HR=1.02 ; 95 % CI=0.85–1.23 )  and toxicity . Progression-free survival  ( HR 0.78 ; CI 0.70–0.88 ) ,  TTP  ( HR=0.85 ; 95 % CI=0.72–0.99 ) and  overall response rate  ( RR=0.56 ; 95 % CI=0.46–0.68 ) were significantly better for  gemcitabine combination chemotherapy  , but offset by the greater  grade 3/4 toxicity thrombocytopenia  ( RR=1.94 ; 95 % CI=1.32–2.84 ) ,  leucopenia  ( RR=1.46 ; 95 % CI=1.15–1.86 ) ,  neutropenia  ( RR=1.48 ; 95 % CI=1.07–2.05 ) ,  nausea  ( RR=1.77 ; 95 % CI=1.37–2.29 ) ,  vomiting  ( RR=1.64 ; 95 % CI=1.24–2.16 ) and  diarrhoea  ( RR=2.73 ; 95 % CI=1.87–3.98 ) . There is no significant advantage on secondary end point analyses for administering  5FU  in combination over  5FU  alone . There is improved  PFS/TTP and response rate  , with gemcitabine-based combinations , although this comes with greater toxicity."
"nBackground : The European Palliative Care Research Collaboration is developing clinical guidelines on cachexia in  patients with advanced cancer .  A systematic review on the use of  fish oil/omega-3-fatty acids (n-3-FA)/eicosapentaenoic acids ( EPA )  in  advanced cancer patients suffering from cancer cachexia  was performed as part of the guideline development . Methods : The systematic literature search in Medline on the use of  fish oil/n-3-FA/EPA  identified  244 papers , with 38 publications included in the final evaluation  . Some smaller trials , often unr and omized and without a control group , reported a good effect of  n-3-FA  in  patients with advanced cancer and cachexia .  However , the results of the larger r and omized controlled trials could not support the positive results , as they mostly did not find a significant effect . Results : Adverse effects such as  abdominal discomfort , fish belching , fish aftertaste , nausea and diarrhoea  were reported with a low incidence .  No serious adverse effects  were documented , but  adverse effects  often had an  impact on quality of life .  This often limited dose escalations or even led to discontinuation of  n-3-FA .  Conclusion : There is not enough evidence to support a net benefit of  n-3-FA  in cachexia in advanced cancer . On the other h and , adverse effects were infrequent , with no severe adverse effects . The results from the review led to a weak negative GRADE recommendation."
" There is no evidence from RCTs to support or refute the use of  partial liquid ventilation  in  children with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome .  Adequately powered , high quality RCTs are still needed to assess its efficacy .

The studies should be published in full."
" Nitric  oxide  did not demonstrate any statistically significant effect on  mortality  and transiently  improved oxygenation  in  patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure  . Lack of data prevented assessment of other clinical ly relevant end points . If further trials comparing inhaled  nitric oxide  with an inhaled  placebo  are to proceed , they should be stratified for primary disease , assess the impact of other combined treatment modalities for respiratory failure , and must specifically evaluate clinical ly relevant outcomes , before any benefit of inhaled  nitric oxide  for respiratory  failure  can be excluded."
" There is some evidence suggesting that oral appliance improves  subjective sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing  compared with a control .  Nasal continuous positive airways  pressure appears to be more effective in improving   sleep disordered breathing   than oral  appliance .  Until there is more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of oral appliances , it would appear to be appropriate to restrict oral  appliance therapy  to patients with sleep apnoea who are unwilling or unable to comply with continuous positive airways pressure therapy."
"nBackground Several studies have examined the effects of  balance training  in  elderly individuals following total knee arthroplasty ( TKA )  , although findings appear to be equivocal . Objectives This systematic review and meta- analysis examined the effects of  balance training  on  walking capacity , balance-specific performance and other functional outcome measures  in  elderly individuals following TKA .  Methods Data sources : Pubmed , PEDro , Cinahl , SportD iscus , Scopus . Eligibility criteria : Data were aggregated following the population -intervention-comparison- outcome ( PICO ) principles . Eligibility criteria included : ( 1 ) r and omised controlled trials ; ( 2 ) studies with comparative groups ; ( 3 )  training interventions  were incorporated post-TKA ; and ( 4 ) outcome measures included walking capacity , balance-specific performance measures , subjective measures of physical function and pain and knee range-of-motion .  Participants : Elderly individuals ( 65 + years ) who underwent total knee arthroplasty .  Interventions :  Balance interventions that consisted of balance exercises , which were compared to control interventions that did not involve balance exercises , or to a lesser extent .  Participants also undertook  usual physiotherapy care in conjunction with either the balance and /or control intervention .  The intervention duration ranged from 4 to 32 weeks with outcome measures reported immediately following the intervention . Of these , four studies also reported follow-up measures ranging from 6 to 12 months post- interventions . Study appraisal : PEDro scale . Synthesis methods Quantitative analysis was conducted by generating forest plots to report on st and ardised mean differences ( SMD ; i.e. effect size ) , test statistics for statistical significance ( i.e. Z values ) and inter-trial heterogeneity by inspecting I2 . A meta-regression was also conducted to determine whether training duration predicted the magnitude of SMD . Results  Balance training  exhibited significantly greater improvement in  walking capacity  ( SMD = 0.57 ; Z = 6.30 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 = 35 % ) ,  balance-specific performance measures  ( SMD = 1.19 ; Z = 7.33 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 = 0 % ) and  subjective measures of physical function  ( SMD = 0.46 ; Z = 4.19 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 = 0 % ) compared to conventional training immediately post-intervention . However , there were no differences in  subjective measures of pain  ( SMD = 0.77 ; Z = 1.63 ; P > 0.05 ; I2 = 95 % ) and  knee range-of-motion  ( SMD = 0.05 ; Z = 0.39 ; P > 0.05 ; I2 = 1 % ) between interventions . At the 6- to 12-month follow-up period , improvement  in combined measures of walking capacity and balance performance  ( SMD = 041 ; Z = 3.55 ; P < 0.001 ; I2 = 0 % ) were significantly greater  for balance training  compared  to conventional training  , although no differences were observed  for subjective measures of physical function and pain  ( SMD = 0.26 ; Z = 2.09 ; P > 0.05 ; I2 = 0 % ) . Finally , the training duration significantly  predicted subjective measures of pain and physical function  ( r2 = 0.85 ; st and ardised β = 0.92 ; P < 0.001 ) , although this was not observed  for walking capacity and balance-specific performance measures  ( r2 = 0.02 ; st and ardised β = 0.13 ; P = 0.48 ) . Limitations A number of outcome measures indicated high inter-trial heterogeneity and only articles published in English were included .  Conclusion Balance  training  improved walking capacity , balance-specific performance and functional outcome measures  for  elderly individuals following TKA .  These findings may improve clinical decision-making for appropriate post-TKA exercise prescription to minimise falls risks and optimise physical function."

"eEvidence suggests a role of long chain  polyunsaturated  fatty acids ( LC-PUFA ) , in which animal foods are especially rich , in optimal neural development . The LC-PUFAs  docosahexaenoic acid  ( DHA ) and arachidonic  acid  , found in high concentrations in the brain and retina , have potential beneficial effects on  cognition  , and  motor and visual functions .  Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism . The treatment of PKU consists of a  phenylalanine-free diet  , which limits the intake of natural proteins of high biological value . In this systematic review , we summarize the available evidence supporting a role for  LC-PUFA supplementation  as an effective means of increasing  LC-PUFA levels  and  improving visual and neurocognitive functions  in  PKU patients .  Data from  controlled trials of children and adults ( up to 47 years of age )  were obtained by search ing the MEDLINE and SCOPUS data bases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines . For each selected study , the risk of bias was assessed applying the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration . The findings indicate that  DHA supplementation  in  PKU patients  from 2 weeks to 47 years of age improves  DHA status  and decreases  visual evoked potential P100 wave latency  in  PKU children  from 1 to 11 years old .  Neurocognitive  data are inconclusive."

"dIn the field of acupuncture research there is an implicit yet unexplored assumption that the evidence on  manual and electrical stimulation techniques  , derived from basic science studies , clinical trials , systematic review s , and meta-analyses , is generally interchangeable . Such interchangeability would justify a bidirectional approach to acupuncture research , where basic science studies and clinical trials each inform the other . This article examines the validity of this fundamental assumption by critically review ing the literature and comparing  manual to electrical acupuncture  in basic science studies , clinical trials , and meta-analyses . The evidence from this study does not support the assumption that these techniques are interchangeable . This article also identifies endemic method ologic limitations that have impaired progress in the field . For example , basic science studies have not matched the frequency and duration of manual needle stimulation to the frequency and duration of  electrical stimulation .  Further , most clinical trials purporting to compare the two types of stimulation have instead tested   electroacupuncture   as an adjunct to  manual acupuncture .  The current findings reveal fundamental gaps in the underst and ing of the mechanisms and relative effectiveness of  manual versus electrical acupuncture .  Finally , future research directions are suggested to better differentiate electrical from manual simulation , and implication s for clinical practice are discussed."

" : Generalisability of findings : On the available evidence there are no obvious benefits for one inhaler device over another when used by  children aged 5–15 years with chronic asthma .  However , the evidence , in the majority of cases , was compiled on  children with mild to moderate asthma and restricted to a limited number of drugs .  Therefore the findings may not be generalisable to those at the more severe end of the spectrum of the disease or to inhaler devices delivering some of the drugs used in the management of asthma . Need for further research : Many of the previous studies are likely to have been underpowered . Further clinical trials with a robust methodology , sufficient power and qualitative components are needed to demonstrate any differences in clinical re source use and patients ’ asthma symptoms . Further studies should also include the  behavioural aspects of patients  towards their medication and its delivery mechanisms . It is acknowledged that sufficient power may prove impractical owing to the large numbers of  patients  required."

"sOBJECTIVE The clinical impact of anti-drug antibodies ( ADAbs ) in  paediatric patients with JIA  remains unknown . This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to summarize the prevalence of ADAbs  in JIA studies  ; investigate the effect of ADAbs on  treatment efficacy and adverse events ;  and explore the effect of immunosuppressive therapy on antibody formation . METHODS PubMed , Embase and the Cochrane Library were systematic ally search ed to identify relevant clinical trials and observational studies that reported prevalence of ADAbs . Studies were systematic ally review ed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review s and Meta-Analyses and appropriate proportional and pairwise meta-analyses were performed . RESULTS  A total of 5183 references were screened ; 28 articles , involving 26 studies and 2354 JIA patients , met eligibility criteria .   Prevalence of ADAbs  ranged from 0 % to 82 % across nine biologic agents . Overall  pooled prevalence of ADAbs  was 16.9 % ( 95 % CI , 9.5 , 25.9 ) . Qualitative analysis of included studies indicated that antibodies to  infliximab , adalimumab  ,  anakinra  and  tocilizumab  were associated with  treatment failure and /or hypersensitivity reactions .  Concomitant MTX uniformly reduced the  risk of antibody formation  during adalimumab treatment ( risk ratio 0.33 ; 95 % CI 0.21 , 0.52 ) .  The association of ADAbs with  treatment failure and hypersensitivity reactions  indicates their clinical relevance in  paediatric patients with JIA .  Based on our findings , we recommend a preliminary course of action regarding immunogenicity of biologic agents in patients with JIA . Further strategies to predict , prevent , detect and manage immunogenicity could optimize treatment outcomes and personalize treatment with biologic therapies."
"eBackground R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) indicate that long-acting  bronchodilator  combinations , such as  β2-agonist (LABA)/muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA )  , have favorable efficacy compared with commonly used COPD treatments . The objective of this analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of  LABA/LAMA with LAMA or LABA/inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS )  in  adults with stable moderate-to-very-severe COPD .  Methods This systematic review and meta- analysis ( PubMed / MEDLINE , Embase , Cochrane Library and clinical trial/manufacturer data bases ) included RCTs comparing ≥12 weeks  ’ LABA/LAMA treatment with LAMA and /or LABA/ICS  ( approved doses only ) . Eligible studies were independently selected by two authors using predefined data fields ; the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed . Results  Eighteen studies ( 23 trials ) were eligible ( N=20,185  ) .  LABA/LAMA  significantly  improved trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 )  from baseline to week 12 versus both LAMA and LABA/ICS ( 0.07 L and 0.08 L , P<0.0001 ) , with patients more likely to achieve clinical ly important  improvements in FEV1  of > 100 mL ( risk ratio [ RR ] : 1.33 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : [ 1.20 , 1.46 ] and RR : 1.44 , 95 % CI : [ 1.33 , 1.56 ] , respectively , the number needed to treat being eight and six ,  respectively )  .  LABA/LAMA   improved transitional dyspnea index and St George ’s Respiratory Question naire scores  at week 12 versus LAMA ( both P<0.0001 ) , but not versus LABA/ICS , and  reduced  rescue medication use versus both ( P<0.0001 and P=0.001 ,   respectively  ) .  LABA/LAMA significantly  reduced moderate/severe exacerbation  rate compared with LABA/ICS ( RR 0.82 , 95 % CI  : [ 0.75 , 0.91 ] ) . Adverse event ( AE )  incidence was no different  for  LABA/LAMA versus LAMA treatment , but it was lower versus LABA/ICS ( RR 0.94 , 95 % CI : [ 0.89 , 0.99 ] ) , including  a lower  pneumonia risk ( RR 0.59 , 95 % CI : [ 0.43 , 0.81  ] )  . LABA/LAMA presented a lower risk  for withdrawals  due to lack of  efficacy  versus LAMA ( RR : 0.66 , 95 % CI : [ 0.51 , 0.87 ] ) and due to AEs versus LABA/ICS ( RR : 0.83 , 95 % CI : [ 0.69 , 0.99 ] ) . Conclusion The greater  efficacy  and  comparable safety profiles  observed with  LABA/LAMA  combinations versus  LAMA  or  LABA/ICS  support their potential role as first-line treatment options in  COPD  . These findings are of direct relevance to clinical practice because we included all currently available  LABA/LAMAs  and comparators , only at doses approved for clinical use."
" In comparison with  placebo  , we have found an increased risk of  serious adverse events  with regular salmeterol  .  There is also a clear increase in risk  of asthma-related mortality  in  patients not using inhaled corticosteroids  in the two large surveillance studies . Although the increase in  asthma-related mortality  was smaller in  patients taking inhaled  corticosteroids  at  baseline , the confidence interval is wide , so it can not be concluded that the inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol  .  The adverse effects of regular  salmeterol  in children remain uncertain due to the small number of  children studied ."
"dWomen  with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM )  are at a higher risk of developing  type 2 diabetes .  Several  postpartum lifestyle intervention  studies have been conducted for this high-risk group ; however , the r and omized clinical trials have not been evaluated systematic ally . Thus , the aim of this article is to evaluate the outcomes of clinical trials that focus on diabetes prevention among  women with DGM .  This systematic review utilized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines .  Chinese and US  data bases were search ed . R and omized controlled trials of  postpartum lifestyle interventions  to prevent type 2 diabetes  in women with prior GDM  were review ed . Outcomes included in this review are  type 2 diabetes incidences , insulin insistence , and weight-related measures .  The effect size of these outcomes in each study was computed . Data on intervention components were extracted , including type ( in-person vs. technology-based ) , content  ( diet  or  physical  activity or both ) , form ( individual session vs. group session ) , duration , intensity , evaluation time point , and program delivery .  A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria .  The  mean annual type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) incidence  of the intervention group was lower than that of the comparison  group  ( 6.0 % vs. 9.3 % ) , although there was no statistical difference between the two groups . About 50 % of these studies and two-thirds of studies , respectively , reported a significant decrease in  insulin resistance-related measures and weight-related measures  in the intervention group compared with the comparison group . The median intervention duration and study length were 6 months .  Postpartum lifestyle interventions  can be effective in reducing  T2DM development and insulin resistance  , and  decrease weight  in  women with GDM history  , regardless of the intervention types ( technology-based or in-person ) . Effective interventions typically include dietary changes while some physical activity changes can also improve outcomes . However , more interventions with long-term efficacy evaluation are warranted."

"yABSTRACT Motivation is a proximal determinant of behaviour , and increasing motivation is central to most health behaviour change interventions . This systematic review and meta- analysis sought to identify features of  physical activity interventions  associated with favourable changes in three prominent motivational constructs : intention , stage of change and autonomous motivation . A systematic literature search identified  89 intervention studies ( k = 200 ; N = 19,212 ) which assessed changes in these motivational constructs for  physical activity .   Intervention descriptions were coded for potential moderators , including  behaviour change techniques ( BCTs )  , modes of delivery and  theory  use . R and om effects comparative subgroup analyses identified  18  BCTs and 10 modes of delivery independently associated with changes in at least one motivational outcome ( effect sizes ranged from d = 0.12 to d = 0.74 ) .  Interventions delivered face-to-face or in gym setting s  ,  or which included the BCTs ‘ behavioural goal setting ’ , ‘ self-monitoring ( behaviour ) ’ or ‘ behavioural practice /rehearsal ’ , or which combined self-monitoring ( behaviour ) with any other BCT  derived from control  theory  , were all associated with beneficial changes in  multiple motivational constructs  ( effect sizes ranged from d = 0.12 to d = 0.46 ) . Meta-regression analyses indicated that increases  in intention and stage of change , but not autonomous motivation  , were significantly related to increases in  physical activity  . The intervention characteristics associated with changes in  motivation  seemed to form clusters related to  behavioural experience and self-regulation  , which have previously been linked to changes in physical activity behaviour . These BCTs and modes of delivery merit further systematic study , and can be used as a foundation for improving interventions targeting increases in motivation for physical activity."
" The different variants of AA need to be defined because diverse therapeutic approaches are available . A more precise definition of the functional impairments associated with AA may allow a more correct decision about the most appropriate therapy to be prescribed . Moreover , this may allow for a more effective performance of the different therapeutic approaches once they are better targeted to the different scenarios of AA."
" There are limitations associated with the available RCT evidence on the effects of  combined diet and exercise interventions  during pregnancy for preventing GDM . Results from 13 RCTs ( of moderate quality ) suggest no clear difference in the  risk of developing GDM  for  women receiving a  combined diet and exercise intervention   compared with  women  receiving   no intervention  .  However , the ability to draw firm conclusions was limited by variations in the quality of trials , characteristics of the interventions and population s assessed , and outcome definitions between trials . Based on the data currently available , conclusive evidence is not available to guide practice . Further large , well- design ed RCTs , addressing the limitations of previous studies , are needed to assess the effects of combined interventions on preventing GDM and other relevant pregnancy outcomes including  caesarean birth , large-for-gestational age and perinatal mortality . Health service utilisation and costs , and longer-term outcomes for mothers and their babies  should be included . We identified another 16 trials which are ongoing and we will consider these for inclusion in the next up date of this review."
"MObjective : The primary objective of this review was to summarize the literature regarding factors associated with  self-efficacy for  disease management ( SEDM )   in cross-sectional studies and the efficacy/effectiveness of  psychosocial interventions  that are design ed to improve SEDM in  adolescent and young adult ( AYA ) cancer survivors .  The secondary aim was to assess the quality of included studies . Method : We conducted a systematic review using PsycINFO and PubMed to identify studies for review .  Eligible studies were conducted in AYA cancer survivors ages 15 to 39 ; included a measure of  SEDM  assessed as an outcome or in a cross-sectional analysis ; and were published in a peer- review ed , English- language journal .  Results : From  the 2,910 records screened  , 7 cross-sectional studies and 4 intervention studies met criteria for inclusion . Eleven of the 12  SEDM  measures in the studies were author-constructed , limiting the ability to draw conclusions across studies . All cross-sectional studies met at least 21 of 26 relevant quality assessment criteria , and intervention studies met between 4 and 11 of 14 criteria . Cross-sectional findings indicate that  SEDM  is positively associated with  health-promoting behaviors  and inversely related  to physical and mental health problems .  The intervention studies demonstrated that  behavioral and educational interventions  have the potential to increase  SEDM .  Conclusion : Directions for research include the need for vali date d measures of  SEDM  for  AYA  cancer survivors , as well as interventions that target both the health care team ’s and the patient ’s role in promoting SEDM."

" FDC improved  dyspnoea and lung function  compared to aclidinium , formoterol or placebo , and this translated into an increase in the number of responders on combination treatment .  Quality of life  was better with combination compared to formoterol or  placebo .  There was no evidence of a difference between FDC  and monotherapy or  placebo for  exacerbations , hospital admissions , mortality , non-fatal SAEs or adverse events .  Studies reported a lower risk of  moderate exacerbations and adverse events  with FDC compared to formoterol  ;  however , larger studies would yield a more precise estimate for these outcomes."
" Most studies showed positive effects of the interventions on  caregiver-specific outcomes  , yet direct comparisons of the effectiveness were limited .

"sPoor nutrition is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases and nutritional deficiencies .  Dietary interventions  have been proposed to improve eating habits . The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of r and omized clinical trials of  nutritional interventions  in food habits among  older people .  A systematic literature review using the MEDLINE , LILACS , Scopus , Cochrane Library , Web of Science and Google Scholar data bases was conducted , according to PRISMA guidelines . The keywords were : food and nutrition education OR educación alimentaria y nutricional OR educação alimentar e nutricional AND clinical trial OR  ensayo clínico OR ensaio clínico AND elderly OR aged OR anciano OR idoso AND human OR seres humanos .  The pooled st and ardized mean differences ( SMD ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were estimated using a r and om-effects model . Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using I² tests . After screening based on the title and abstract , and a full-text assessment ,  11 studies  remained . Results of pooling eleven studies were as follows : SMD = 0.25 ( 95 % CI = 0.15 - 0.34 ; I² = 0,0 % ) for  vegetable  , SMD = 0.18 ( 95 % CI = 0.08 - 0.27 ; I² = 0,0 % ) for fruit and SMD = 0.27 ( 95 % CI = 0.18 - 0.36 ; I² = 58,3  % )   for  fibre intake . Our results suggest   that nutritional interventions  were effective in increasing vegetable , fruit and fibre intake  . However , these results should be analyzed carefully , due to the small number of studies included in the meta- analysis . Further studies should be encouraged due to the aging process."

"dIntroduction  Preventative interventions  are shown to be effective in reducing 40 % of the mortality due to unhealthy behaviours and lifestyles .  Health-promoting self-care  has been recognised as a promising strategy in preventative health . However , self-care research is being done around the self-management of chronic illnesses and the promotion of self-care practice s among  healthy population  s has been overlooked by many healthcare systems . Method The study methodology was a systematic review with a narrative synthesis . The search was done through  seven academic data bases  , reference tracking of selected articles and grey literature . The scoping , selection , screening and quality assessment s of the articles were review ed independently by two review ers . Results  Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria .   Self-care behaviour , health-promotive lifestyle changes and medical care utilisation  were some of the main outcomes evaluated in the studies . Positive effects were seen in increasing  self-care and health-promotive behaviours  in most interventions although limited or mixed impact was seen in  health attitudes , beliefs and utilisation of medical services .   Most studies were from high income setting s with low- quality study  design s. The complexity of the word ' self-care ' and inconsistencies in the terminology used in  health-promotive self-care  were significant highlights of the study . Conclusion  Health-promoting preventative self-care interventions  show promise in increasing the well-being of  healthy people .  However , the method ological drawbacks limit the generalisability of the findings . As the dem and for self-care interventions increases , the lack of a formal globally accepted definition and framework and complexity of behaviour change are key limitations to consider moving forward."
"aThe last ten years have seen hardly any improvement in the  prognosis  of  ovarian carcinoma .  There is a great need for new treatment strategies , and a recent retrospective study showing a  survival advantage  with the use of  beta blockers  met with a very positive response . This systematic review summarizes the current state of knowledge and research on the topic : A data base analysis identified  six clinical studies  showing inconsistent results with respect to the administration of  beta blockers  and disease course . The 13 pre clinical studies identified showed almost without exception both that catecholamines had detrimental  effects on tumour progression  , and that these effects could be influenced by pharmacological blockade . Overall the available evidence does not justify the use of  beta blockers  in clinical practice for  ovarian carcinoma  at the present time . This article also outlines details of research design required for further studies needed on the subject . Pre clinical research findings are however very impressive : They not only form an important basis for the development of future clinical studies but also , through revealing new pathomechanisms , they already make an important contribution towards the development of new treatment strategies for ovarian carcinoma."
"rContext Knowing which strategies are the most effective for promoting preventive care might improve the low rates of utilization of many proven prevention practice s. Various approaches for  promoting preventive care  have been tried , but which ones work best ? Contributions This comprehensive meta-regression model summarized 81 controlled studies of different approaches for ensuring recommended  adult immunizations  and cancer  screening  . Reorganizing the delivery of  preventive services  ( for example ,  prevention clinics , planned prevention visits , design ated nonphysician staff )  was the most effective strategy . The next most effective approaches were  patient financial incentives  and  patient reminders .  Implication s High- quality health care should include organizational approaches that make identification and delivery of preventive services a routine part of patient care . The Editors Despite the strong commitment to improved prevention reflected in reports from national task forces and performance measures of health care organizations , performance rates remain below national and international targets ( 1 - 5 ) . Prevention literature ( 6 - 19 ) and expert panels ( 20 , 21 ) identify  influenza  and  pneumococcal pneumonia vaccinations  and  breast  , cervical , and  colon cancer screening  as key health care services for reducing morbidity and mortality in  adults .  These five services are covered by most insurance plans , including Medicare . Although the extensive literature on methods for changing provider behavior in general and on improving prevention rates in particular provides many insights , we found no clear message about how best to improve indicated prevention activities in usual- practice setting s. One difficulty in interpreting the literature is that evaluated interventions often comprise one or more empirically design ed components that are evaluated as a unit , making it difficult to identify what caused the intervention as a whole to succeed or fail . We used rigorous qualitative methods and a typology based on clinical literature and social science theory to characterize the key components and features of prevention improvement interventions identified from published and unpublished literature . We then used meta- analysis techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of each intervention component and feature across multiple studies . Finally , we qualitatively vali date d the meta- analysis results by comparing them with results from individual studies that directly compared intervention components . This approach allows us to judge the relative effectiveness of specific types of interventions ; these results can then guide policymakers , health care organizations , and research ers about how to improve the performance of critical preventive services . Methods Conceptual Model On the basis of a conceptual model developed from social science theory and clinical literature ( 22 ) , we categorized interventions according to seven intervention components and four potential targets of the intervention . We also postulated seven key features of the intervention that have been thought to contribute to success ( Figure ) . Figure . Conceptual framework for assessing interventions to improve receipt of preventive services . We defined the seven types of intervention components as follows .  Reminders  : Reminders prompt  providers or patients  to use a  preventive service .  Reminders can be generated manually or by computer and can be delivered to  providers and patients  verbally , on paper , or on a computer screen . Provider feedback : Summaries of rates of performance of indicated prevention activities over a specified period are given to providers to stimulate improvement . Providers can be  individual clinicians , groups of clinicians , or organizations .  Summaries may include recommended clinical action . Education : The dissemination of information about indicated prevention practice s can target  providers or patients .  Means of dissemination include mass mailings , conferences , workshops , training sessions , lectures , and in-person detailing or individual educational sessions . Financial incentives  : Financial incentives  are direct or indirect financial rewards tied to a specific action of a provider or patient . Incentives include reductions in patient payment or copayment and direct compensation to patients or providers . Regulatory and legislative actions : Regulatory and legislative actions at the national or regional level operate outside the medical care organization to change the external environmental , legal , and organizational context s in which providers practice . Organizational change : Changes in the work processes in a medical care organization can facilitate improved performance of preventive services . Changes can include addition or re design of jobs , changes in clinical procedures , or changes in facilities or infrastructure .  Mass  media  campaigns  : Media campaigns target large population segments through television , radio , newspapers , posters , leaflets , and booklets . We defined a key intervention feature as being present when an intervention design intentionally incorporated it . Key features were the following . Social influence : Use of social influence to enhance interventions is based on social science theory indicating that delivery of an intervention through valued members of a social group is more likely to change behavior . Marketing and outreach : Marketing and psychological theories indicate that interventions can best be sold to providers and patients by targeting these groups ' own interests and motivations , using vivid language through channels that maximize customer convenience . High visual appeal and clarity : Most interventions include visual material s of some kind . Some types of graphic design flaws , such as high contrast or small font size for  geriatric population  s , make intervention material s almost unusable . In this study , we lacked access to the material s themselves . We judged this feature to be present if the authors of the included study had indicated attention to graphic design or had used films or videotapes . Collaboration and teamwork : Sociologic theory and the clinical quality improvement ( 23 ) literature identify the importance of collaboration and teamwork in fostering behavioral change . Interventions such as  continuous quality improvement  include this feature as a foundation . Design based on needs , barriers , incentives , assessment s , or theory : Both marketing and quality improvement theory indicate that tailoring an intervention on the basis of identification of a target population 's needs and current barriers to the desired behavior will enhance the chances of success . Top management support : Sociologic theories of organizational change indicate that major changes are not generally possible without top management support .  Active learning strategies :  Although almost all interventions incorporate  learning  of some kind , not all types of learning are equally effective in changing behavior . In general , educational and psychological theory supports participatory or active learning strategies , such as  role playing  instead of  passive learning  through  lectures  or  written material s  alone . Each intervention component and key intervention feature was independently abstract ed without regard to other intervention components or intervention features . Data bases for Literature Search We used  three data bases to  identify  articles on our five preventive services :  1 )  the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care ( EPOC ) Special Register  ( developed through prospect i ve and retrospective search es of MEDLINE [ since 1966 ] , EMBASE [ since 1980 ] , Healthstar [ since 1975 ] , and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register [ since 1996 ] ] ; 2 ) previous systematic review s [ 24 - 32 ] ; and 3 ) the  Health Care Quality Improvement  Projects ( HCQIP ) data base , which contains  narrative project documents  ( NPDs ) and is maintained by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration [ HCFA ] ) . Each NPD describes an individual research project conducted by a Medicare Peer Review Organization ( PRO ) , including its aims , background , quality indicators , collaborators , sampling  methods  , interventions ,  measurements  , and results . Most projects in this data base are not published elsewhere . Our search was current through February 1999 . A complete description of our data bases has been reported elsewhere ( 33 ) and is available at www.hcfa.gov/healthyaging/2a.htm . Article Selection and Data Abstract ion Article selection , quality assessment , and data abstract ion were done in st and ard fashion by using two trained physician review ers working independently ; disagreements were resolved by consensus or third-party adjudication . The Appendix provides details of this process . Statistical Analysis All analyses were conducted by using SAS software ( SAS Institute , Inc. , Chicago , Illinois ) ( 34 ) . We first retrieved all studies that assessed the effects of an intervention relative to a usual care or control group . We fit meta-regression  models  ( 35 ) to estimate  adjusted odds ratios  for evaluating the relative effectiveness of different  intervention components (  for example ,  provider education )  on receiving different services . This multivariate modeling approach allowed us to include multiple components as a study 's covariates if the study 's intervention contained more than one and to independently assess the effect of each individual component after adjustment for all other components . We used a similar approach for intervention features ( for example , visual appeal ) but limited ourselves to testing only a few key intervention components by feature interactions that we chose a priori . We fit separate sets of models for each of the following preventive services : immunizations ( this model combined studies for both  influenza vaccination  and  pneumococcal vaccination )  , screening   mammography   ,  cervical  cytology  screening  , and  fecal occult  blood  testing  ( for colon cancer."

">Oral  appliances ( OAs )  have demonstrated efficacy in treating   obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA )   , but many different  OA  devices are available . The Japanese Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine supported the use of  OAs  that advanced the m and ible forward and limited mouth opening and suggested an evaluation of their effects in comparison with untreated or CPAP . A systematic search was undertaken in 16 April 2012 . The outcome measures of interest were as follows :  Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI ) , lowest SpO2 , arousal index , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , the SF-36 Health Survey .  We performed this meta- analysis using the Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) system .  Five studies remained eligible  after applying the exclusion criteria . Comparing OA and control appliance ,  OA  significantly reduced  the weighted mean difference ( WMD ) in both AHI and the arousal index  ( favouring OA , AHI : -7.05 events h(-1 ) ; 95 % CI , -12.07 to -2.03 ; P = 0.006 , arousal index : -6.95 events h(-1 ) ; 95 % CI , -11.75 to -2.15 ; P = 0.005 ) .  OAs  were significantly less  effective at reducing the WMD in AHI and improving lowest SpO2 and SF-36  than CPAP , ( favouring OA , AHI : 6.11 events h(-1 ) ; 95 % CI , 3.24 to 8.98 ; P = 0.0001 , lowest SpO2 : -2.52 % ; 95 % CI , -4.81 to -0.23 ; P = 0.03 , SF-36 : -1.80 ; 95 % CI , -3.17  to -042 ; P = 0.01 ) . Apnea Hypopnea Index and arousal index  were significantly improved by OA relative to the untreated  disease . Apnea Hypopnea Index , lowest SpO2 and SF-36  were  significantly  better with CPAP than with  OA .  The results of this study suggested that  OAs   improve  OSA compared with untreated . CPAP appears to be more  effective  in  improving OSA   than OAs ."

" : Our review indicated that  robotic therapy  had a better  economic outcome  than  conventional therapy .  For  patients  with  severe disability  from  significant stroke  , a moderate dominance favoring  robotic therapy  for health benefit was found , and a strong dominance for  robotic therapy  for cost benefit was found . However , the limited number of studies in the review required us to view the results with caution . Key sensitivity factors affecting  robotic therapy  were the number  of patients who could be treated  per robotic session and the  time therapists spent with patients  during a  robotic session . Robotic therapy  could be prescribed primarily for  patients with severe impairment after stroke  . To maximize the cost economics , hospital providers may wish to organize their  robotic therapy programs  based on cost-sensitivity factors . For further research , we suggest better collaboration in methods within this field to enable a more comparable  cost computation  across studies."
" Few well-controlled trials have examined the most effective  smoking cessation  strategies for  highly disadvantaged groups  , especially  among the homeless , indigenous smokers and prisoners .  The use of  behavioural smoking cessation interventions  for some  socially disadvantaged groups  appears promising ; however , overall findings are inconsistent . Further research is needed to establish the most effective interventions for vulnerable high-risk groups . Special attention should be given to increasing sample size and power , and to sound evaluation methodology to overcome method ological limitations of conducting research with these high-risk groups."

 The limited available evidence supports a beneficial role of pre-oxygenation with  NIV and HFNC  before intubation of  critically ill patients  . Recruitment maneuvers may increase  post-intubation oxygenation .  Ramped position increased the  number of intubation attempts ;  thiopental had negative  hemodynamic effects  and videolaryngoscopy might favor adverse events.
" Based on the results of our review ,  acupuncture  appears to be effective for treating  headaches  and , although more research is needed , seems to be a promising treatment option for  anxiety , sleep disturbances , depression and chronic pain .  It does not , however , demonstrate any substantial  treatment benefit  for substance abuse . Because there were no review s on PTSD or sexual function that met our pre-defined inclusion criteria , we can not comment on  acupuncture  ’s effectiveness in treating these conditions . More quality data are also needed to determine whether  acupuncture  is appropriate for treating  fatigue or cognitive difficulties .  Further , while  acupuncture  has been shown to be generally safe , safety was not described in the majority of studies , making it difficult to provide any strong recommendations . Future research should address safety reporting in detail in order to increase our confidence in  acupuncture  ’s efficacy across the identified TSR components."
 This meta- analysis of studies supports the use of  taxane containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens  with improvement of  overall survival and disease-free survival  for  women with operable early breast cancer .  The review did not identify a subgroup of patients where  taxane  containing treatment may have been more or less effective . Dosage and scheduling of the taxane drug is not clearly defined and we await results of the next generation of studies to determine the optimal use of  taxanes  in early breast cancer.
 The results of this study showed that  PCI  has a significant effect on  decreasing BM  but little benefit in  prolonging OS  when brain imaging was introduced to confirm lack of BM after initial chemoradiotherapy and before irradiation.
"sBreast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among  women worldwide  , with rising incidence numbers .  In Belgium  ,  one out  of  eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer .  Fortunately , 80 % of those  breast cancer patients  will still be alive 10 years after diagnosis due to improvements in screening and  treatment strategies  . However , an important portion of the breast cancer survivors ( BCS ) will face side effects , such as  sleep disturbances  , long after treatment ends . It has been demonstrated that untreated insomnia in BCS negatively impacts  mood , physical symptoms , pain sensitivity , fatigue , and quality of life .  Furthermore , insomnia is increasingly considered an independent risk factor for future depression in BCS . The importance of underst and ing sleep disturbances in cancer population s has been highlighted and recognized as warranting further research . Therefore , the purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence and the risk factors for the development of  sleep disturbances  in BCS . PubMed , Web of Science , and PEDro were systematic ally screened for studies encompassing data regarding the prevalence or risk factors of sleep  disturbances  in BCS . If possible , meta-analyses were performed . Subgroup analyses were undertaken based on the method ological quality , study design , type of sleep disturbance , and the use of a measurement tool with strong psychometric properties to investigate significant heterogeneity ( I2 > 50 % ) across studies .  A total of 27 studies were found eligible .  The pooled estimate for  sleep disturbances  prevalence is 0.40 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = [ 0.29–0.52 ] , I2 = 100 % , p < 0.00001 ) and ranged from 0.14 ( 95 % CI = [ 0.04–0.24 ] ) to 0.93 ( 95 % CI = [ 0.91–0.95 ] ) . Subgroup analyses did not reduce the heterogeneity among studies . Meta-analyses were performed for seven risk factors . Significant differences for the odds of  developing sleep disturbances  were found for  hot flashes  ( pooled OR ( ORp ) 2.25 , 95 % CI = [ 1.64–3.08 ] , I2 = 0 % , p = 0.90 ) ,  race  ( ORp 2.31 , 95 % CI = [ 1.56–3.42 ] , I2 = 0 % , p = 0.47 ) , and  menopause  ( ORp 1.84 , 95 % CI = [ 1.11–3.06 ] , I2 = 0 % , p = 0.70 ) . After withdrawing the studies that did not rely on the use of a  measurement  tool with strong psychometric properties ,  pain  ( ORp 2.31 , 95 % CI = [ 1.36–3.92 ] , I2 = 27 % , p = 0.25 ) , depressive symptoms ( ORp 3.20 , 95 % CI [ 2.32–4.42 ] , I2 = 0 % , p = 0.63 ) , and  fatigue  ( ORp 2.82 , 95 % CI = [ 1.98–4.02 ] , I2 = 0 % , p = 0.60 ) became significant as well , with a substantial decrease of heterogeneity .  Prevalence for sleep disturbances  ranged from  0.14  to  0.93  with the vast majority of the studies investigating  insomnia and sleep-wake disturbances  . High heterogeneity makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions  . Pain , depressive symptoms , hot flashes , fatigue  , non-Caucasian  race  , and menopausal status were significantly associated with increased odds for developing sleep disturbances."

"eBACKGROUND Immunization is the most common cause of iatrogenic  pain in childhood .  Despite the availability of various analgesics to manage vaccine injection pain , they have not been incorporated into clinical practice . To date , no systematic review has been published on the effectiveness of  pharmacologic and combined interventions  for reducing injection pain . OBJECTIVES The objectives of this article were to assess the  effectiveness  and  tolerability  of various  pharmacologic and combined interventions  for reducing the pain experienced by  children during immunization .  METHODS MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were search ed to identify r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and quasi- RCTs pertaining to  pharmacologic and combined interventions  to reduce injection pain  in children 0 to 18 years of age  using vali date d child self-reported pain or observer-reported assessment s of child pain and distress . We included trials that ( 1 ) investigated the effects of  pharmacologic interventions ( ie  ,  topical local anesthetics , sweet-tasting solutions , vapocoolants , and oral analgesics [ acetaminophen or ibuprofen ] ) ;  ( 2 ) compared  2 different analgesic interventions ;  and ( 3 ) evaluated combinations  of > or= 2 analgesic interventions  , including breastfeeding . Meta-analyses were performed using a fixed-effects model . RESULTS  Thirty-two studies , involving 3856 infants and children 2 weeks to 15 years of age  , were included in this systematic review ; 23 of these trials were included in meta-analyses .  Ten trials  ,  including 1156 infants and children  , evaluated topical local  anesthetics .  In a meta- analysis of  2 trials  ,  including 276 children ,   child self-reported pain ratings  were lower in children who received  topical local anesthetics  than in those who received a  placebo .  The  st  and ardized  mean difference (  SMD  )  was -0.25 ( 95 % CI , -0.49 to -0.01 ; P = 0.04 ) . The use of  topical local anesthetics  was associated with  less pain  than was  placebo  in  4 trials  ( 527 infants ) based on the difference between  Modified Behavioral Pain Scale scores  ( range , 0 - 10 ) before and after vaccination : the weighted mean difference ( WMD ) was -0.79 ( 95 % CI , -1.10 to -0.48 ; P < 0.001 ) and the SMD was -0.43 ( 95 % CI , -0.60 to -0.26 ; P = 0.001 ) .  Observer-rated pain  , using  visual analog scale  ( VAS  )  scores ( range , 0 - 100 mm ) , was significantly lower ( WMD , -16.56 mm ; 95 % CI , -22.11 to -11.01 ; P < 0.001 ; and SMD , -0.75 ; 95 % CI , -1.00 to -0.49 ; P < 0.001 ) . The number needed to treat ( NNT ) to prevent 1 child from having clinical  ly significant pain  , measured using the  Faces Pain Scale  ( FPS ; score , > -3 ) , was 3.7 ( 95 % CI , 2.5 to 7.7 ) from 1 study .  Eleven trials ( 1452 infants and children )  evaluated sweet-tasting solutions . In a  meta- analysis of 6 studies ( 665 infants )  , administration of  sucrose with or without non-nutritive sucking  ( NNS ; use of a pacifier ) was associated with less  pain  than no intervention or  sterile water  with or without NNS ; the SMD was -0.56 ( 95 % CI , -0.72 to -0.40 ; P < 0.001 ) .  Total cry duration  was lower in infants who received  sucrose  than in those who received  sterile water  ( WMD , -9.41 sec ; 95 % CI , -13.18 to -5.64 ; P < 0.001 ; and SMD , -0.43 ; 95 % CI , -0.61 to -0.25 ; P < 0.001 ) . The NNT to prevent 1 child from having  clinical  ly  significant pain  , using the  Neonatal Infant Pain Scale  ( score , > 3 ) , was 1.4 ( 95 % CI , 1.0 to 2.5 ) . In 3 trials that evaluated sweet-tasting solutions longitudinally ,  administration of sucrose or glucose  (  vs sterile water  , with or without NNS ) was associated with  reduced pain  based  on cry duration  or  the University of Wisconsin Children 's Hospital Pain Scale  ( all , P < 0.05 ) . Data were pooled for  2 studies conducted in 100 children who received a spray  with a vapocoolant or placebo  at the injection site before the procedure .   Child self-rated pain  ( 4-point scale ) was lower in the group treated with the vapo-coolant ( SMD , -0.43 ; 95 % CI , -0.83 to -0.02 ; P = 0.04 ) ; significant heterogeneity was reported for this outcome ( chi(2 ) = 5.51 ; P = 0.02 ; I(2 ) = 82 % ) . In  2  studies  ( 117 children )  , no significant difference was found between vapocoolants and typical care ( no treatment ) based on child self-reports ; significant heterogeneity was reported for this outcome ( chi(2 ) = 9.89 ; P = 0.02 ; I(2 ) = 90 % ) . None of the studies identified in the literature search evaluated  oral analgesics ( acetaminophen or ibuprofen ) .   Four studies ( 318 infants and children )  compared 2 different analgesic interventions ; there was insufficient evidence to suggest superiority of 1 intervention over another . Combinations of > or=2 analgesic interventions were more effective than the individual interventions used alone .  Child  self-reported  pain ratings  were combined for 4 studies ( 350 children ) ; the SMD was -0.52 ( 95 % CI , -0.73 to -0.30 ; P = 0.001 ) . Data  on cry duration  were pooled for 3 studies ( 229 infants and children ) ; the WMD was -18.87 seconds ( 95 % CI , -32.05 to -5.69 ; P = 0.005 ) .  Parent-rated child pain ( VAS ) scores  were combined for 3 studies ( 365 infants and children ) ; the WMD was -15.66 mm ( 95 % CI , -19.74 to -11.57 ; P < 0.001 ) .  Nurse- or physician-rated child pain ( VAS ) scores  were combined for 3 studies ( 368 infants and children ) ; the WMD was -17.85 mm ( 95 % CI , -21.43 to -14.28 ; P < 0.001 ) . In a meta- analysis of 4 studies ( 474 infants ) , infants who were breastfed before , during , and after the procedure  had less pain  than did those who were not breastfed ( SMD , -2.03 ; 95 % CI , -2.26 to -1.80 ; P < 0.001 ) . A meta- analysis of 3 studies ( 344 infants ) found a  shorter cry duration  for infants who were breastfed than for those who were not breastfed ( WMD , -38.00 sec ; 95 % CI , -42.27 to -33.73 ; P < 0.001 ; and SMD , -2.00 ; 95 % CI , -2.27 to -1.73 ; P < 0.001 ) . The NNT to prevent 1 infant from having clinical ly significant pain , using the  Facial Pain Rating Scale  ( pain vs no pain ) , was 7.7 ( 95 % CI , 4.5 to 25.0 ) from 1 study .   Topical local anesthetics , sweet-tasting solutions , and combined analgesic interventions  , including  breastfeeding  , were associated with reduced  pain  during childhood immunizations and should be recommended for use in clinical practice."
"sOBJECTIVE Meta-analyses of trials of  psychological treatments  for  emotional distress in breast cancer ( BCa )  conclude that efficacious treatments exist . Subsequently , their implementation in routine care is widely promoted by health policy . However , the method ological quality of these trials has not been systematic ally evaluated . The present review investigates this issue . METHOD A systematic search identified  r and omized controlled trials of  psychological treatments  for emotional distress in BCa .  The   Psychotherapy  Outcome Study Methodology Rating  Form was used to assess the quality of trials . Generic design elements , including representativeness of sample , control of concomitant treatments , reporting  clinical significance  outcomes , and design elements specific to  psychotherapy trials  , including  manualisation  ,  therapist  training   , and  therapist  adherence   and   competence   were evaluated . RESULTS  91 trials were eligible .  Overall ,  method ological quality  was low . Generic design elements were limited in most trials : 15 % specified as an inclusion criterion that participants were distressed ; 10 % controlled for concomitant treatments ; and 11 % reported the clinical significance of findings . Design elements specific to  psychotherapy trials  were also implemented poorly : 51 % used treatment manuals ; 8 % used certified trained therapists ; and monitoring  of adherence and competence  occurred in 15 % and 4 % , respectively .  The method ological quality of  psychological treatment trials  for  emotional distress in BCa  is improving . However , if relevant health policies are to be adequately empirically informed , trials of greater method ological rigour are essential . Trials should include participants with clinical levels of distress , control for concomitant treatments and report the clinical significance of findings . Trialists must also consider the specific requirements of  psychotherapy  trials."
" Clinical heterogeneity , such as different lengths of follow up and higher plateau pressure in control arms in two trials make the interpretation of the combined results difficult .  Mortality  is significantly reduced at day 28 and the effects on  long term mortality  are uncertain , although the possibility of a clinical ly relevant benefit can not be excluded . There is no evidence that  low Vt ventilation  is beneficial in patients where hypercapnia is potentially harmful."
"eBACKGROUND & AIM Despite their well known anti-inflammatory actions , the clinical usefulness of  omega-3 PUFA  in  inflammatory bowel disease  is controversial . We aim ed to systematic ally review the available data on the performance of  omega-3 PUFA  as therapeutic agents in these patients  .  METHODS Electronic data bases were systematic ally search ed for RCT of  fish oil or  omega-3 PUFA  therapy  in  both active and inactive ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's disease  , without limitation on either the length of therapy or the form it was given , including nutritional supplements and enteral formula diets . Eligible articles were assessed for method ological quality on the basis of the adequacy of the r and omisation process , concealment of allocation , blinding of intervention and outcome , possible biases , and completeness of follow-up . The  five-point Oxford quality score  was calculated . RESULTS  A total of 19 RCT were finally selected for this review .  Overall , available data do not allow to support the use of  omega-3 PUFA supplementation  for the treatment of both active and inactive  inflammatory bowel disease .  Negative results are quite consistent in trials assessing the use of  omega-3 PUFA  to maintain  disease remission  , particularly ulcerative colitis , and to a lesser extent Crohn 's disease . Trials on their use in active disease do not allow to draw firm conclusions mainly because the heterogeneity of design ( ulcerative colitis ) or their short number ( Crohn 's disease ) . In most trials , the appropriateness of the selected placebo is question able .  The present systematic review does not allow to make firm recommendations about the usefulness of  omega-3 PUFA  in inflammatory bowel disease."
"CThe objective was to systematic ally review the  efficacy and safety  of  n-3 ( omega-3 fatty acids , fish oil )  for maintaining remission in  Crohn 's disease ( CD ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC )  . Electronic data bases were search ed systematic ally for r and omized controlled trials of  n-3  for maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .  Studies of patients of any age group who were in remission at the time of recruitment and were followed for at least 6 months were included .  The primary outcome was  relapse rate  at the end of the follow-up period .  Nine studies were eligible for inclusion ; six studies of CD ( n = 1039 ) and three of UC ( n = 138 ) .  There was a statistically significant benefit for  n-3  in CD ( relative risk [ RR ] 0.77 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.61 - 0.98 ) ; however , the studies were heterogeneous ( I(2 ) = 58 % ) . The  absolute risk reduction  was -0.14 ( 95 % CI : -0.25 to -0.02 ) . Opinions may vary on whether this is a clinical ly significant effect . Two well-done studies with a larger sample size reported no benefit . A sensitivity analysis excluding a small pediatric study result ed in the pooled RR being no longer statistically significant . A funnel plot analysis suggested publication bias for the smaller studies . For UC , there was no difference in the  relapse rate  between the  n-3  and control groups ( RR 1.02 ; 95 % CI : 0.51 - 2.03 ) . The pooled analysis showed a higher  rate of diarrhea  ( RR 1.36 ; 95 % CI : 1.01 - 1.84 ) and  symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract  ( RR 1.96 ; 95 % CI : 1.37 - 2.80 ) in the  n-3  treatment group . There are insufficient data to recommend the use of  omega 3 fatty acids  for maintenance of remission in CD and UC."

" Supplementing  very low birthweight infants  with  vitamin A  is associated with a reduction in  oxygen requirement  amongst survivors at 36 weeks post-menstrual age . Whether clinicians decide to utilise repeat intramuscular doses of  vitamin A  to prevent  chronic lung  disease may depend upon the local incidence of this outcome and the value attached to achieving a modest reduction in this outcome , balanced against the lack of other proven benefits and the acceptability of treatment . The benefits , in  terms of vitamin A status , safety and acceptability  of delivering  vitamin A  in an intravenous emulsion compared with repeat intramuscular injections should be assessed in a further trial."
"sDue to the critical role of  family caregivers  in  cancer pain management  , this systematic review was undertaken to examine what is known about of their experiences and needs . Search es were conducted using electronic data bases , and research reports from  1991 to 2007  were analyzed using a matrix method .  Family caregivers  were actively engaged in assisting with pain management and experienced significant needs and concerns related to this role . Myths and fears about opioid use remain widespread across cultures studied and across care setting s.  Family caregivers  need education about   pain  management , training  in  problem-solving skills  , and recognition from providers about their role in pain management . When clinicians better underst and and respond to the needs of the  family caregivers  , they can enhance the  quality of life and care outcomes  for both patients and their caregivers."

"DLifestyle interventions , namely  optimizing nutrition and increasing physical activity  , remain the cornerstone of therapy for  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD )  , as this can lead to the significant improvement or resolution of disease . The optimal nutritional approach to treat NAFLD remains unclear . The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of different nutritional patterns on  hepatic , metabolic , and weight-loss endpoints .  MEDLINE via PubMed , Embase , Scopus , and Google Scholar were search ed . R and omized trials of  dietary interventions alone  for  adults with NAFLD  were selected . Two authors independently review ed articles , to select eligible studies , and performed data abstract ion .  Six studies , representing 317 patients , were included . The participants had a median age of 46 , mean body mass index ( BMI ) 31.5 and were 64.3 % male .  The mean study duration was 16.33 ± 8.62  weeks . Reduction in hepatic steatosis ( HS )  was statistically significant in 3/5  Mediterranean Diet ( MD ) , one low-carbohydrate , one intermittent fasting (  IF  )  and  1/2 low fat ( LF ) diet  interventions . A total of 3/5 studies using MD , 1/2 LF interventions , and the one IF intervention demonstrated  significant reductions in weight  . In conclusion , there appears to be most data in support  of MD-based  interventions , though further r and omized trials are needed to assess comparative effectiveness for NAFLD."
"sAbstract  Online educational interventions  are increasingly developed for  health professionals and students  , although graduate and undergraduate medical curricula often contain limited information about how to assess and manage pain . This study review s the literature on the effectiveness of pain-related  online educational re  sources . Studies were identified through a search of Medline , PsychINFO , Web of Science , CINAHL , PubMed , Scopus , Cochrane Library , Google Scholar , and OpenGrey data bases . Search terms included 3 concept blocks : ( 1 ) type of intervention —  online education , computer-based , e-learning , web-based , and internet-based ;  ( 2 )  population —pediatrician , physician , nurse , psychologist , and medical ;  and ( 3 ) outcome —pain*.  Thirty-two studies ( 13 r and omised controlled trials , 5 nonr and omised controlled trials , and 14 single-group pre – post studies ) were included .  Ten provided data for inclusion in a series of between-groups meta-analyses . After intervention , participants  receiving online instruction  had significantly  greater knowledge  compared with those receiving  training as usual/alternative training  ( Hedges ' g = 0.80 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.12 - 1.49 ) , and students had significantly  greater skills  compared with students  receiving training as  usual ( g = 1.34 , CI : 0.38 - 2.30 ) . No significant differences were found  for confidence/competence  ( g = 0.02 , CI : −0.79 to 0.84 ) or  attitudes/beliefs  ( g = 0.16 , CI : −0.48 to 0.79 ) . Although  online educational re  sources show promise in improving learner knowledge , considerable heterogeneity exists between studies in quality , design , educational content , and outcomes . Furthermore , method ologically robust RCTs are required to establish the effectiveness of  online educational interventions  and a greater underst and ing of the key features of successful online re sources ,  including cognitive interactivity  . Few studies  assessed health outcomes  for patients , remaining a major priority for future investigations."
"eBackground Most of patients  with dementia  are cared for by family members . Caring for  people with dementia  is challenging ; approximately 30–55 % of caregivers suffered from  anxiety or depressive symptoms .  A range of studies have shown that  psychosocial interventions  are effective and can  improve caregivers ’ quality of life , reduce their care burden , and ease their anxiety or depressive symptoms .  However , information on the acceptability of these interventions , despite being crucial , is under-reported . Methods Systematic search es of data bases were conducted for literature published on EMBASE , PubMed , The Cochrane Library ,  Web  of Science ,  and  PsycARTICLES until August 2017 and the search es were up date d on June 2018 . The selection criteria included primary studies with data about the  acceptability of  psychosocial interventions  for informal caregivers and publications written in English .  Two authors independently selected studies , extracted study characteristics and data , assessed the method ological quality of the included studies by using the Effective Public Health Practice Project ( EPHPP ) Quality Assessment Tool and Critical Appraisal Skills Programme ( CASP ) Qualitative Research Checklist , and conducted a narrative synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data . Results A total of  10,610 abstract s  were identified through systematic search es . Based on screening titles and abstract s ,  207 papers were identified that met the criteria for full paper review , with 42 papers from 13 different countries meeting the inclusion criteria .  We found high- and moderate- quality evidence showing psychosocial interventions were  acceptable  , with important benefits for caregivers . Facilitators of acceptability included caregivers ’ need for intervention , appropriate content and organization of the intervention , and knowledge and professionalism of the staff . Barriers to acceptability included participants ’  poor health status  and  low education levels  ,  caregiving burden  ,  change of intervention implementers  , and  poor system performance  of interventions . Conclusion There is preliminary evidence to support the  acceptability  of  psychosocial interventions  for  dementia caregivers .  However , the available supporting evidence is limited , and there is currently no adequate information from these studies indicating that the acceptability has received enough attention from research ers . More well- design ed studies assessing psychosocial interventions are needed to give specific statements about acceptability , and the measure of acceptability with psychosocial interventions should be more comprehensive."
"dA systematic review was undertaken to assess the technology used to create  stereovision  for human perception . Adverse effects associated with  artificial stereoscopic technology  were review ed with an emphasis on the impact of  surgical performance  in the  operating  room  .  MEDLINE / PubMed library data bases were used to identify literature published up to Aug 2017 . In the past 60 years , four major types of technologies have been used for  reconstructing stereo images : anaglyph , polarization , active shutter , and autostereoscopy .  As none of them can perfectly duplicate our natural stereoperception , user exposure to this artificial environment for a period of time can lead to a series of psychophysiological responses including  nausea , dizziness , and others .  The exact mechanism underlying these symptoms is not clear . Neurophysiologic evidence s suggest that the visuo-vestibular pathway plays a vital role in coupling unnatural visual inputs to autonomic neural responses . When  stereoscopic technology  was used in surgical environments , controversial results were reported . Although recent advances in  stereoscopy  are promising , no definitive evidence has yet been presented to support that  stereoscopes  can enhance  surgical performance  in image-guided surgery .  Stereoscopic technology  has been rapidly introduced to healthcare . Adverse effects to human operators caused by immature technology seem inevitable . The impact on surgeons working with this  visualization system  needs to be explored and its safety and feasibility need to be addressed."

"eBiosimilars are biological drugs which are similar to the authorized biologics ( “ reference product ” ) but not identical ( 1 ) . The European legislation has offered since 2006 a legal framework for  biosimilars .  The concept and methodology of the comparative investigations are further treated in the guidelines of the European Medicines Agency (EMA)(1 ) . A biosimilar is only authorized when it can be stated with appropriate certainty that its variability and the differences with the reference medicinal product will not have a relevant influence on the safety or efficacy . EMA has approved a first one  biosimilar to infliximab , namely CT-P13  and marketed with two br and names  Remsima  ( 2 ) and  Inflectra  ( 3 ) , on the basis of two r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) in  Rheumathoid  Arthritis ( RA ) and Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) ( 4 , 5 ) . More recently , a second  biosimilar SB2 , Flixabi  ( 6 ) , has been approved/registered and has also been evaluated in RA ( 7 ) . According to EMA , the use of the biosimilar  CT-P13  could be recommended in IBD from the extrapolation from the Planetra ( 5 ) and Planetas ( 4 ) studies in Rheumatologic diseases . Beyond the biosimilarity between the  Infliximab  reference product and the biosimilar CT-P13 and extrapolation of safety and efficacy in IBD , the cost-effectiveness of biosimilars is of great value as it dramatically reduces the burden of the cost of anti-TNFs to the health care system in Belgium . Initially , BIRD reserved its position on the broad use of biosimilars in IBD and has been waiting reassuring data on the following evidence :  disease pathogeny and mode of action of  infliximab   are different within and between IBD and rheumatologic diseases . A non-inferiority Norwegian RCT , the NORSWITCH Trial , demonstrates non-significant difference in  terms of safety and efficacy  between  CT-P13  and the originator  infliximab  and switch from the originator  infliximab  to  CT-P13  in a  large population of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases ( IMIDs ) including IBD  ( 8) . The ministry of Health Maggie de Block has issued new guidance on the National Strategy for the use of biosimilars in Belgium calling for the full application of the legislation of June 15 , 2006 of public tendering and emphasizing further technical and legal implementation on January 16 , 2016 with the monitoring of every single hospital in Belgium on the adoption of biosimilars . Recently , FAGG/AFMPS has revised its position statement on biosimilars and pharmacovigilance with the need for post-marketing risk management program ( RMP ) . A recent systematic review ( 9 ) up date d by ECCO Position Statement group , shows 15 studies demonstrating  comforting data  about  safety , efficacy and immunogenicity  ( 10 ) . Following our recommendations in 2015 ( 11 ) , we here up date the BIRD position statement on the  use of biosimilars  for IBD in 2017 in order to further contribute to extend their use in clinical practice."

"sDyspnea ,  nausea and vomiting , anorexia  ,  fatigue  , and  sleep disturbances  are common and distressing in  advanced cancer .  We up date d previous systematic review s of how these symptoms can be alleviated with targeted literature search es . The approach to these symptoms requires comprehensive symptom assessment ; treating underlying causes when benefits exceed risks ; prioritizing treatment , as patients usually have many symptoms ; and addressing psychosocial and spiritual distress . For dyspnea , evidence supports  systemic opioids  and  nonpharmacological treatments  such as a fan . The strongest evidence supports  metoclopramide  for cancer-related  nausea  and  octreotide  for  bowel obstruction .  For  anorexia  , enteral or parenteral nutrition is indicated with obstruction and expected prognosis of at least 6 weeks . Evidence supports several drugs for  appetite affecting quality of life .  For  fatigue  , evidence supports psychosocial interventions and  methylpheni  date . For  insomnia  , evidence supports  cognitive-behavioral therapy  in cancer ; no sleep agents have superior effectiveness."

"AINTRODUCTION The pathogenesis of upper airway collapse in  people with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA )  is not fully understood . The aim of this study was to systematic ally review the literature in order to assess the most relevant anatomical characteristics of the upper airway related to the pathogenesis of OSA by analyzing the three-dimensional upper airway anatomy . METHOD A PICO ( population /patient , intervention , comparison , outcome ) search strategy , focusing on the upper airway anatomy  of people with OSA  , was conducted using the following data bases : MEDLINE ( PubMed ) , Excerpta Medica data base ( EMBASE ) , Web of Science , and Cochrane Library . The studies in which  three-dimensional images  were made from the  participants who were  awake and  in the supine position during quiet breathing  were selected in this systematic review . RESULTS Of the  758 unique retrieved studies  , eight fulfilled the criteria for this systematic review . The  minimum cross-sectional area of the upper airways of  people  with OSA  , which is influenced by many factors such as hard and soft tissues surrounding the upper airway , was significantly smaller than that of those without OSA .  Within the limitation of the selected studies , this systematic review suggested that a small minimum cross-sectional area is the most relevant anatomical characteristic of the upper airway related to the pathogenesis of OSA."

A  barrier membrane covering an autologous bone graft  (  guided bone regeneration  [ GBR ] ) is expected to prevent graft resorption . Good clinical results have been reported for GBR , although potential complications and relatively high costs have been implicated as disadvantages . However , most studies on the subject have been uncontrolled . PURPOSE The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available evidence that  barrier membranes  prevent  bone resorption  in autologous onlay bone grafts . The primary outcome measure was  bone resorption .  RESULTS The  search yielded 182 articles .  Two observers independently appraised  32 relevant studies method ologically  , yielding  14 controlled studies . The articles included human and animal experiments with heterogenous objectives and outcome variables .  Although most authors concluded that they had found evidence for the protective effect of barrier  membrane  on  bone resorption  in bone grafts , this systematic review reveals that the available evidence is too weak to support this . Most included studies were  animal experiments  ; thus , extrapolation to the human situation is difficult . Most studies also had a small number of test sites , and sample size justification was generally not reported . Furthermore , ambiguity and lack of significance were found in many studies , along with additional limitations such as implantation site , nonsuitable design s , and varying outcome measures .  Based on a systematic review of the literature , further evidence is needed to determine whether  barrier membranes  prevent  bone resorption  in autologous onlay bone grafts."
"eAbstract Background : Despite growing access to effective therapies , asthma  control  still needs improvement . Many non-drug factors , such as allergens , air pollutants and stress also affect  asthma  control and patient quality of life , but an overview of the effectiveness of  non-drug  interventions on  asthma control  was lacking . Objectives : To identify  non-drug interventions  likely to improve  asthma control .  Methods : A systematic review of the available literature in Medline and the Cochrane Library was conducted in March 2017 , without any time limit . Initial search ing identified  884 potentially relevant clinical trial reports , literature review s and meta-analyses  , which were screened for inclusion using criteria of quality , relevance , and reporting outcomes based on asthma control . Results :  Eighty-two publications met the inclusion criteria  . In general , the quality of the studies was low .  Patient education programmes  ( 22 studies ) significantly  improved asthma control .   Multifaceted interventions  ( 10 studies ) , which combined  patient education programmes  with decreasing exposure to indoor allergens and pollutants , significantly improved  asthma control  based on clinical ly relevant outcomes .  Renovating homes  to reduce exposure to allergens and indoor pollutants  improved control  ( two studies ) . Air filtration systems ( five studies ) were  effective  , especially in children exposed to second-h and smoke . Most measures attempting to reduce exposure to dust mites were  ineffective  ( five studies ) .  Dietary interventions  ( eight studies ) were  ineffective  .  Promoting physical activity  ( five studies ) tended to yield positive results , but the results did not attain significance . Conclusion : Twenty-six interventions were  effective in asthma control .  Simultaneously combining several action plans , each focusing on different aspects of asthma management , seems most likely to be effective."
"eAccording to the World Health organization ( WHO ) , more than 10 % in  people older than 60  years suffer from osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Over the last years , there has been an increased interest around regenerative  medicine  , especially regarding stem  cell  treatments and related applications . We hypothesize that  stem cell therapies  can represent a feasible option for  idiopathic knee OA  , delaying or even avoiding the joint replacement . To emphasize the potential of percutaneous  injections  of  mesenchymal stem cells  for knee OA , a comprehensive systematic review of the literature was conducted . Two independent authors ( FM , GC ) performed the literature search . This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines ( PRISMA ) . The main data bases were accessed : Pubmed , Embase , Google Scholar , Cochrane Systematic Review s , Scopus , AMED . For this systematic review , all articles treating  percutaneous injections of mesenchymal stem cells  for knee OA were considered . Because of the rapid advancements promoted by the scientific progress on stem cell expansion and processing , only articles published within the last five years were included . Solely articles reporting the outcomes of interest across 6- and 12-month follow-up were recruited for eligibility . We included only studies reporting quantitative data under the outcomes of interest . We referred for the quality assessment to the Coleman Methodology Score ( CMS ) . The statistical analysis was performed with Review Manager Software 5.3 ( The Nordic Cochrane Centre , Copenhagen ) .  A total of 18 studies were enrolled in the present study , comprising 1069 treated knees . The mean age of the sample s was 57.39 ± 7.37 years .  72 % of the included studies harvested the stem cells from the iliac crest  ( bone marrow-derived MSCs )  , the remaining 28 % from the adipose  tissue  (  adipose-derived MSCs   ) . The mean visual analogic scale  improved from 18.37 to 30.98 and 36.91 at 6- and 12-month follow-up ,  respectively . The mean WOMAC score  improved from 25.66 to 25.23 and 15.60 at 6- and 12-month follow-up ,  respectively . The mean walking distance  improved from 71.90 to 152.22 and 316.72 at 6- and 12-month follow-up ,  respectively . The mean Lequesne scale  improved from 33.76 to 12.90 at  12-month follow-up . The KOOS score  improved from 41.07 to 8.47 % and 18.94 at 6- and  12-month follow-up . All the KOOS  subscales improved significantly from the baseline . A total of 136 ( 12.7 % )  local complications  were detected . According to the current evidence s and the main findings of this systematic review , we reported that  MSC infiltrations  for knee OA can represent a  feasible  option , leading to an overall remarkable improvement of  all clinical and functional considered outcomes  , regardless of the cell source .  Patients  treated at earlier-degeneration stages reported statistically significant greater  outcomes  .  The pain and function scores  were improved considerably , thus , leading to a significant  improvement  of patient participation in recreational activities and quality of life."
" Sham-controlled trials show statistically significant benefits  ;  however , these benefits are small , do not meet our pre-defined thresholds for clinical relevance , and are probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding . Waiting list-controlled trials of  acupuncture  for peripheral joint osteoarthritis suggest statistically significant and clinical ly relevant benefits , much of which may be due to expectation or placebo effects."
" Investing time to sensitively inquire about the supportive care needs of this patient population is key , whilst evaluating and re-shaping clinical interactions based on patients ' priorities is equally essential . The diverse needs identified require a multi-professional and multi-agency approach to ensure unmet needs are addressed or measures offered."
"sObjective : To summarize evidence on the effects of  aquatic therapy  on  mobility  in  individuals with neurological diseases .  Data sources : MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsycInfo , CENTRAL , CINAHL , SPORTD iscus , PEDro , PsycBITE and OT Seeker were search ed from inception to 15 September 2014 . H and - search ing of reference lists was performed in the selected studies . Review methods : The search included r and omized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies that investigated the use of  aquatic therapy  and its effect on mobility of  adults with neurological diseases .  One review er screened titles and abstract s of retrieved studies from the search strategy . Two review ers independently examined the full texts and conducted the study selection , data extraction and quality assessment . A narrative synthesis of data was applied to summarize information from included studies . The Downs and Black Scale was used to assess method ological quality . Results :  A total of 116 articles were obtained for full text eligibility  .  Twenty studies  met the specified inclusion criteria : four R and omized Controlled Trials ( RCTs ) , four non-r and omized studies and 12 before- and -after tests . Two RCTs (  30 patients with stroke in the aquatic   therapy   groups )  , three non-r and omized studies and three before- and -after studies showed “ fair ” evidence that  aquatic therapy  increases  dynamic balance  in  participants  with some neurological disorders . One RCT ( seven patients with stroke in the aquatic  therapy  group ) and two before- and -after tests ( 20 patients with multiple sclerosis ) demonstrated “ fair  ”  evidence on improvement of  gait speed  after  aquatic therapy .  Conclusion : Our synthesis showed “ fair ” evidence supporting the use  of aquatic therapy  to improve  dynamic balance and gait speed  in adults with certain neurological conditions."
"yStaff  training  has been cited as an effective intervention to reduce  behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of  dementia ( BPSD )  in nursing home residents .  However , the reproducibility of interventions can be a barrier to their dissemination . A systematic review of controlled clinical trials on the effectiveness of   staff training   for reducing  BPSD  , published between 1990  and 2013  on the EMBASE , PUBMED , LILACS , PSYCHINFO and CINAHL data bases , was carried out to evaluate the reproducibility of these interventions by 3 independent raters . The presence of sufficient description of the intervention in each trial to allow its reproduction elsewhere was evaluated . Descriptive analyses were carried out . Despite reference to a detailed procedures manual in the majority of trials , these manuals were not easily accessible , limiting the replication of studies . The professional expertise requirement for training implementation was not clearly described , although most studies involved trainers with moderate to extensive expertise , further limiting training reproducibility."
"sTo evaluate the efficacy of the  adjunctive laser therapy  in conventional non-surgical treatment of  chronic periodontitis  , an electronic search was performed through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , PubMed , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Scopus , Web of Science , China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) , and China Biology Medicine ( CBM ) Disc , for relevant r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) or quasi- RCTs . All the  12 included studies ( 11  RCTs and  1  quasi- RCT ) were qualified for descriptive and quantitative analysis . Outcomes were divided into two groups according to the length of follow-ups ( long term and short term ) . Subgroup analyses were performed based on the mode of laser ( inside and outside mode ) . Among all included research es ,  reduction in probing depth ( PD ) and gain in clinical attachment level ( CAL )  were presented with the mean value and 95 % confidence interval , while  bleeding on probing ( BOP )  was assessed descriptively . Meta- analysis suggested that  adjunctive laser therapy   reduced PD  at 3 months [ mean difference ( MD ) = −0.26 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) range = −0.43 to −0.09 , p = 0.003 ] but did not demonstrate significant effect on  the  CAL at either 3 months ( MD = −0.03 , 95 % CI range = −0.25 to 0.19 , p = 0.79 ) or 6 months ( MD = −0.11 , 95 % CI range = −0.38 to 0.16 , p = 0.43 ) . Subgroup analyses indicated  that laser therapy  would be more effective when the probes were set up outside the periodontal pockets."
"tOBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effectiveness of using  computers  to  deliver patient self-management programs ( PSMPs )  to  patients with chronic illness in health supported setting s.  METHODS We included  r and omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) , where the experimental intervention was compared either with an  equivalent ' st and ard ' PSMP delivered by staff , usual care or no intervention  and reported data either on clinical or behavioral outcomes . We conducted a narrative synthesis , incorporating a small quantitative analysis to enable comparisons across studies . RESULTS A  total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria .  There was insufficient evidence to determine whether  computer-based PSMPs  were superior to st and ard programs . However , it appeared that these interventions were effective when compared to no intervention . Interventions incorporating behavior change techniques beyond the provision of information appeared more effective than those that did not .  Evidence from the current review , whilst limited , suggests that  computer-based PSMPs  , delivered in health-supported setting s , show potential for  changing health behaviors  and  improving clinical outcomes  in  patients with chronic illness .  PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Although the approach shows promise , it is premature to recommend the integration of these interventions into clinical practice . However , more well design ed trials are warranted to test their efficacy and cost-benefit."
" Currently , evidence is not available to provide a robust assessment on the use of  vitamin C  in the management of asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction . Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates . There is no indication currently that  vitamin C  can be recommended as a therapeutic agent in asthma . There was some indication that  vitamin C  was helpful in exercise-induced breathlessness in terms of  lung function  and symptoms  ;  however , as these findings were provided only by small studies they are inconclusive . Most published studies to date are too small and inconsistent to provide guidance . Well- design ed trials with good quality clinical endpoints , such as  exacerbation rates and health-related quality of life scores  , are required."
"AOBJECTIVE The Canadian Rheumatology Association ( CRA ) has developed recommendations for the pharmacological management of  rheumatoid arthritis ( RA )  with  traditional and  biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs  ( DMARD )  in 2 parts . Part II , focusing on specific safety aspects of treatment with  traditional and biologic DMARD  in  patients with RA  , is reported here . METHODS Key questions were identified a priori based on results of a national needs- assessment survey . A systematic review of all clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements regarding treatment with   traditional and biologic DMARD   in  patients with RA published between January 2000 and June 2010  was performed in  Medline , Embase , and CINAHL data bases  , and was supplemented with a "" grey literature "" search including relevant public health guidelines . Systematic review s of postmarketing surveillance and RA registry studies were performed to up date included guideline literature review s as appropriate . Guideline quality was independently assessed by 2 review ers . Guideline characteristics , recommendations , and supporting evidence from observational studies and r and omized trials were synthesized into evidence tables . The working group voted on recommendations using a modified Delphi technique . RESULTS Thirteen recommendations addressing  perioperative care , screening for latent tuberculosis infection prior to the initiation of biologic  DMARD  , optimal vaccination practice s , and treatment of  RA patients with active or a history of malignancy   were developed for rheumatologists , other primary prescribers of RA drug therapies , and  RA patients .   These recommendations were developed based on a synthesis of international RA and public health guidelines , supporting evidence , and expert consensus in the context of the Canadian health system . They are intended to help promote best practice s and improve healthcare delivery for persons with RA."
" Based on the results of two RCTs , a brief intervention has the potential to increase women 's breast cancer awareness . However , findings of this review should be interpreted with caution , as GRADE assessment identified moderate- quality evidence in only one of the two studies review ed . In addition , the included trials were heterogeneous in terms of the interventions , population studied and outcomes measured . Therefore , current evidence can not be generalised to the wider context . Further studies including larger sample s , vali date d outcome measures and longitudinal approaches are warranted."
"  Immunization performance measurement  has many characteristics of a robust quality of care measure , including high acceptance by primary care providers of routine vaccination , association of immunization status with the conduct of other clinical preventive services , agreed-on technical and programmatic st and ards of care , and legislative requirements for medical record documentation . However , it is not without challenges . Careful attention to technical issues has potential to improve immunization delivery health services research."
 There are insufficient data for any reliable conclusions about the effects of treatments for  impaired glucose tolerance  on perinatal outcome.
" The results of this systematic review show that  exercise interventions  can effectively reduce the level of  general fatigue  of  children aged six to 18 years  . No strong conclusions can be made for the use of  massage therapy  or health  education  measures , as there was only one article for each of these interventions . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE The review provides an evidence d-based guide to future priorities for clinical practice .  Exercise intervention  could reduce the  level of general  fatigue  of children aged six to 18 years .  In particular ,  exercise  interventions for  fatigue  are  feasible and safe .  IMPLICATION S FOR RESEARCH There is still a lack of rigorous research on this specific topic . Further research requires more rigorous study design and reporting of method ological issues , such as r and omised controlled trials using concealment of allocation . Other  non-pharmacological interventions  for this problem should also be examined , including cognitive behavioural therapy , stress management , relaxation , support groups and massage therapy."
" In a systematic review , we found a moderate to strong correlation between  clinical activity  , particularly the  combination of rectal bleeding and stool frequency  , and  endoscopic activity  in patients with UC . Although these clinical assessment s could help prioritize patients for endoscopic evaluation in re source -limited setting s , challenges associated with treating patients based on symptoms alone preclude adaptation of current management algorithms."
" A small proportion of total   PT and OT  time  is directed to the involved UL during acute rehabilitation . Given the evidence for early and intense rehabilitation , there is a need to explore the reasons for this low intensity of  UL therapy  in the acute stage post-stroke."
" The data do not  support routine vitamin C supplementation  alone or  in combination with other  supplements for  the prevention of fetal or neonatal death , poor fetal growth , preterm birth or pre-eclampsia  . Further research is required to eluci date the possible role  of   vitamin C  in the  prevention  of   placental abruption and prelabour rupture of membranes .   There was no convincing evidence that  vitamin C supplementation  alone or in combination with other supplements results in other important benefits or harms."
" We could not conclude that the  immune  responses elicited by the combined vaccine were different from or equivalent to the separate vaccines . There was significantly less  immunological response  for  HIB  and tetanus and more  local reactions  in the combined injections . However , these differences rely mostly on one study each . Studies did not use an intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis and we were uncertain about the risk of bias in many of the studies . These results are therefore inconclusive . Studies addressing clinical end points whenever possible , using correct methodology and a large enough sample size should be conducted."
  Surgery for recurrent biliary tract cancer may  prolong survival  in patients with time to recurrence ≥1 year.
"  Additional physical therapy services   improve patient activity and participation outcomes  while reducing  hospital length of  stay for adults . These benefits are likely safe , and there is preliminary evidence to suggest they may be  cost-effective ."
" A single dose immediately following surgery is ineffective based on one study . Gemcitabine may be more active than mitomycin C with a lower  toxicity profile .  Compared to  intravesical BCG therapy , gemcitabine  had similar effects in intermediate risk patients , less effective in high risk patient and superior in BCG refractory patients . However , each r and omised trial identified represents a different clinical setting in NMIBC and therefore the evidence base is limited . Consequently these data should be interpreted with caution until further corroborative evidence becomes available . The aim of intravesical therapy in NMIBC is to prevent  tumour recurrence  and  progression  and to avoid the  morbidity  associated with cystectomy . Intravesical  gemcitabine  is a promising drug that may add to the urologist 's options in achieving this goal."
"tIntroduction  Beneficial effects  of music have been described on several cognitive domains ,  task performance  ,  stress , anxiety and pain .  Greater surgical skill is a factor that has been associated with improved patient outcome . The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effect of music on surgical performance . Methods An exhaustive literature search was performed . The following data bases were search ed : Embase , Medline Ovid , Web of Science , Cochrane CENTAL , PsycINFO Ovid , CINAHL EBSCOhost , ERIC EBSCOhost and Google Scholar . All prospect i ve studies that assessed the effect of a  music intervention  compared to  either another auditory condition or silence  on surgical performance were included in a qualitative synthesis . The study was registered in the PROSPERO - data base ( CRD42018092021 ) . Results The literature search identified  3492 articles of which 9 studies ( 212 participants ) were included .   Beneficial  effects of music were reported on  time to task completion , instrument h and ling , quality of surgical task performance and general surgical performance .  Furthermore , a  beneficial effect of music on muscle activation  was observed . Conclusion Although beneficial effects of music on surgical performance have been observed , there is insufficient evidence to definitively conclude that music has a beneficial effect on surgical performance in the simulated setting . Future studies should be conducted using greater numbers of participants focusing on a more limited range of tasks , as well as validation in the live operating environment."
" Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current vitamin D recommendation may reduce the  risk of gestational diabetes ;  however , it may make little or no difference to the  risk of pre-eclampsia , preterm birth and low birthweight .  Supplementing pregnant women with more than the current  upper limit for vitamin D  seems not to increase the risk of the outcomes evaluated . In general , the GRADE was considered low certainty for most of the primary outcomes due to serious risk of bias and imprecision of results . With respect to  safety  , it appears that  vitamin D supplementation  is a safe intervention during pregnancy , although the parameters used to determine this were either not reported or not consistent between trials . Future trials should be consistent in their reports of  adverse events .  There are 16 ongoing trials that when published , will increase the body of knowledge."
"nCirculating  levels of triacylglycerol ( TG )  is a recognized risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease , a leading cause of death worldwide . The Institute of Medicine and the American Heart Association both recommend the consumption of  n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) , specifically eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )  , to reduce serum TG  in hyperlipidemic individuals .  Additionally , a number of systematic review s have shown that  individuals with any degree of dyslipidemia , elevated serum TG and /or cholesterol  , may benefit from a 20 - 30 % reduction in serum TG after consuming  n-3 PUFA derived from marine sources  . Given that  individuals with serum lipid levels ranging from healthy to borderline dyslipidemic  constitute a large portion of the population , the focus of this review was to assess the potential for  n-3 PUFA  consumption to reduce serum TG in such individuals .  A total of 1341 studies were retrieved and 38 clinical intervention studies , assessing 2270 individuals , were identified for inclusion  in the current review . In summary , a 9 - 26 % reduction  in circulating TG  was demonstrated in studies where ≥ 4 g/day of  n-3 PUFA  were consumed from either marine or  EPA/DHA-enriched  food sources , while a 4 - 51 % reduction was found in studies where 1–5 g/day of EPA and /or DHA was consumed through supplements . Overall , this review summarizes the current evidence with regards to the beneficial effect of n-3  PUFA on circulating TG levels  in  normolipidemic to borderline hyperlipidemic , otherwise healthy , individuals .  Thus demonstrating that n-3 PUFA may play an important role in the maintenance of cardiovascular health and disease prevention."
"sBackground  Acute postoperative pain  remains a major clinical problem that affects patient recovery .  Distal acupoint and peri-incisional stimulation  are both used for relieving  acute postoperative pain in hospital .  Our objective was to assess and compare the effects of  distal and peri-incisional stimulation  on  postoperative pain in open abdominal surgery .  Methods MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Chinese data bases CNKI and Wanfang data were search ed to identify  eligible r and omized controlled trials .   Intensity of postoperative pain , opioid consumption and related data  were extracted and analyzed using a r and om effects model . Risk of bias was assessed . Subgroup analyses were conducted when data were enough . Results  Thirty-five trials were included ,  in which  17 trials studied  distal stimulation  , another 17 trials studied  peri-incisional stimulation  and one studied the combination of the two approaches .  No studies that directly compared the two approaches were identified . Subgroup analysis showed that both  distal and peri-incisional stimulation  significantly alleviated  postoperative resting and movement pain  from 4 h to 48 h after surgery by 6 to 25 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale .  Peri-incisional stimulation  showed a better reduction in  postoperative opioid consumption .  No studies compared the effects of the  combined peri-incisional and distal stimulation  with either mode alone . Overall the quality of evidence was moderate due to a lack of blinding in some studies , and unclear risk of allocation concealment . Conclusion Both  distal and peri-incisional modes  of  stimulation  were effective in reducing  postoperative pain .  Whether a  combined peri-incisional stimulation and distal acupuncture  has superior results requires further studies."
" A psychological intervention , namely  cognitive behavioural therapy  , produced  favourable effects  on  some psychological outcomes  , in  particular anxiety , depression and mood disturbance .  However , the evidence for  survival improvement  is still lacking . These findings are open to criticism because of the notable heterogeneity across the included studies and the shortcomings of the included studies."
"sInfliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody . Published studies indicate that its use in  patients with rheumatoid arthritis  can be efficient in providing long-term benefits . The aim of this study is to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of using  infliximab  for the treatment of  rheumatoid arthritis .  A systematic review was performed to search for r and omized clinical trials that compared intravenous administration of 3 mg/kg body weight  infliximab or placebo  in  patients concomitantly using  methotrexate .  Only  studies  of moderate or high  quality were included . A meta- analysis was conducted to assess the  efficacy  ( based on changes of American College of  Rheumatology  ( ACR ) criteria ) and the  safety  ( based on  serious adverse events , serious infections , malignancy , and deaths  ) of  infliximab  use .  Withdrawals due to adverse events or lack of efficacy  were also evaluated in both  infliximab-treated  and control groups .  Seven trials met the inclusion criteria , comprising 2,129 patients .  In the efficacy meta- analysis , a greater number of  infliximab-treated  patients relative to those in the  placebo  group  achieved ACR20 , ACR50 , and ACR70 values  from 14 weeks to 2 years of treatment . For  safety analysis  , there were no statistically significant differences between the groups .  Withdrawals due to adverse events  were higher in the  infliximab  group relative to the  placebo  group , and  withdrawals  due to  lack of efficacy  were higher in the placebo group relative to the  infliximab-treated  group . This meta- analysis shows a higher  efficacy  of  infliximab  relative to  placebo  without significant  safety differences  between the  infliximab-treated  and control groups."
"eTumor  necrosis factor  (  TNF  ) inhibitors are widely used biologics for the treatment of several chronic  inflammatory  diseases . The launch of  anti-TNF biosimilars  has introduced the possibility of non-medical switching between originator biologics and their biosimilars . However , the potential clinical and patient-reported consequences of non-medical switching remain largely unknown , as much of the evidence comes from poorly or uncontrolled real-world evidence ( RWE ) studies that often have an element of bias and nonst and ardized outcome measures . To appropriately evaluate the  safety , efficacy , and immunogenicity  of non-medical switching from an originator to its biosimilar , we propose that seven key study design elements should be considered when assessing the existing evidence : studies should be ( 1 ) r and omized and double-blind , ( 2 ) adequately controlled , and ( 3 ) adequately powered ; include ( 4 ) multiple switching , ( 5 ) an assessment of immunogenicity , and ( 6 ) adequate follow-up duration ; and ( 7 ) report individual patient-level outcomes . This systematic review assessed the robustness and consistency of the current non-medical switching evidence , with a focus on TNF inhibitors . A comprehensive literature search (  January 2012–February 2018 )  identified  98 publications corresponding to 91 studies ( 17 r and omized controlled trials and 74 RWE studies ) describing non-medical switching from a TNF  inhibitor  originator to its biosimilar .  When assessing the totality of this evidence , none of the non-medical switching studies conducted to date were found to use all seven of the key design elements , and the absence of these elements dilutes the robustness of the data . Furthermore ,  discontinuation rates  varied widely among studies ( 0–87 % ) , suggesting heterogeneity and inconclusiveness of the current  efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity  evidence , particularly at an individual patient level . Therefore , patients should not be indiscriminately switched from an originator  TNF inhibitor  to its biosimilar for non-medical reasons . Switching decisions should remain between the treating physicians and their patients and be made on a case-by-case basis , relying upon robust scientific evidence . Funding : AbbVie .

" This review indicates that there are no clear additional benefits to  calcium supplementation  in prevention of  preterm birth or low infant birthweight .  While there was a statistically significant difference of 56 g identified in  mean infant birthweight  , there was significant heterogeneity identified , and the clinical significance of this difference is uncertain."
"sMultiple  breath inert gas washout ( MBW )  is a lung function technique to measure ventilation inhomogeneity . The technique was developed more than 60 years ago , but not much used for many decades . Technical improvements , easy protocol s and higher sensitivity compared with st and ard lung function tests in some disease groups have led to a recent renaissance of  MBW .  The  lung clearance index ( LCI )  is a common measure derived from  MBW  tests , and offers information on lung pathology complementary to that from conventional lung function tests such as spirometry . The LCI measures the overall  degree of pulmonary ventilation inhomogeneity .  There are other MBW-derived parameters , which describe more regional airway ventilation and enable specific information on conductive or acinar ventilation inhomogeneity . How this specific  ventilation  distribution is exactly related to different disease processes has not entirely been examined yet .  MBW  measurements are performed during tidal breathing , making this technique attractive for  children , even young children and infants .  These benefits and the additional physiological information on ventilation inhomogeneity early in the course of lung diseases have led to increasing research activities and clinical application of  MBW  , especially in  paediatric lung diseases such  as  cystic fibrosis ( CF ) .  In these patients , LCI detects  early airway damage  and enables monitoring of  disease progression  and  treatment response .  Guidelines for the st and ardisation of the  MBW  technique were recently published . These guidelines will , hopefully , increase comparability of  LCI  data obtained in different centres or intervention trials in children and adults . In this non- systematic review article , we provide an overview of recent developments in  MBW  , with a special  focus  on  children .  We first explain the physiological and technical background to this technique with a short explanation of several method ological aspects that are important for underst and ing the principle behind the technique and enable high quality measurements . We then provide examples of  MBW  application in different  lung diseases of children and adults  , with regards to both clinical application and research activities . Lastly , we report on ongoing clinical trials using  MBW  as outcome and give an outlook on possible future developments."
"nBACKGROUND  Neuroendocrine tumours ( NET )  most commonly metastasize to the liver .  Hepatic resection of  NET  hepatic metastases  ( NETHM ) has been shown to improve  symptomology  and  survival .  METHODS A systematic review of clinical studies  before September 2010  was performed to examine the  efficacy  of  hepatic resection for NETHM .  As a secondary end-point , the impact of treatment on  safety  and  symptomology  were determined and prognostic variables were identified . The quality of each study was also assessed using predefined criteria incorporating 9 characteristics . Clinical outcome was synthesized through a narrative review with full tabulation of results of all included studies . RESULTS  Twenty-nine included reported  survival outcomes   with a median 3- , 5- and 10-year  overall survival  of 83 % ( range , 63 - 100 % ) , 70.5 % ( range , 31 - 100 % ) , and 42 % ( range , 0 - 100 % ) , respectively . The  median progression-free survival ( PFS )  was 21 months ( range , 13 - 46 months ) and median 1-,3-,5- and 10-year  PFS  of 63 % ( range , 50 - 80 % ) , 32 % ( range , 24 - 69 % ) , 29 % ( range , 6 - 66 % ) and 1 % ( range , 0 - 11 % ) , respectively . Poor histologic grade , extra-hepatic disease and a macroscopically  incomplete resection  were associated with a poor prognosis . Studies reported a  median rate of symptomatic relief  from surgery in 95 % of patients ( range , 50 - 100 % ) .

The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the dose-response relation between total and specific types of  alcohol beverage ( beer , wine , and spirits )  consumption in  female and the fecundability .  Four electronic data bases were search ed . Observational studies ( cohort and case-control ) that provided female alcohol consumption and fecundity were eligible .  Nineteen studies , involving 98657 women , were included in  this study . Compared to non-drinkers , the combined estimate  ( with relative risk ,  RR ) of  alcohol  consumers  on fecundability  was 0.87 ( 95 % CI 0.78–0.95 ) for overall 19 studies . Compared to non-drinkers , the pooled estimates were 0.89 ( 95 % CI 0.82–0.97 ) for light drinkers ( ≤12.5 g/day of ethanol ) and 0.77 ( 95 % CI 0.61–0.94 ) for moderate-heavy drinkers ( > 12.5 g/day of ethanol ) . Moreover , compared to non-drinkers , the corresponding  estimates on fecundability  were 0.98 ( 95 % CI 0.85–1.11 ) , 1.02 ( 95 % CI 0.99–1.05 ) , and 0.92 ( 95 % CI 0.83–1.01 ) for studies focused on  wine , beer  and spirits , respectively . Dose-response meta- analysis suggested a linear association between  decreased fecundability  and every 12.5 g/d increasing in alcohol consumption with a RR 0.98 ( 95 % CI 0.97–0.99 ) . This first systematic review and meta- analysis suggested that  female alcohol  consumption was associated with  a reduced fecundability ."
"sThis systematic review answered two questions among  adults with chronic conditions :  When included in the same statistical  model  , are Common Sense Model constructs and self-efficacy both associated with ( 1 )  self-management behaviors  and ( 2 )  health outcomes  ? We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included  29 articles .  When included in the same statistical  model  , Common Sense Model constructs and self-efficacy were both correlated with  outcomes . Self-efficacy  was more consistently associated with  self-management behaviors  , and Common Sense Model constructs were more consistently associated with  health outcomes .  Findings support the continued inclusion and integration of both frameworks to underst and and /or improve  chronic illness  self-management and outcomes."
"sOBJECTIVE To identify tools design ed to evaluate the severity of  patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA )  in order to use them in the investigation of prognostic markers in  early arthritis .  METHODS We conducted a systematic review of studies that developed/vali date d an index for RA disease severity . They were analyzed using the COSMIN checklist to assess their method ological quality . In addition , all the variables included were evaluated for their  clarity of definition , feasibility and probability of being present  in each outcome during the first 2 years of the disease course . To estimate redundancy , variables were grouped by domains . RESULTS After  review ing 3,519 articles ,  3 studies were included . The first study , the  PAS  , assessed whether current and lifetime treatment with  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and /or biologics  accurately predicted  RA severity  , as measured by the patient-reported  PAS .  Treatment variables did not fully distinguish patients in the highest and lowest quartiles of PAS scores . Another severity index , the Cl aims  -Based  Index  for RA Severity  ( CIRAS ) , included the variables age , sex ,  Felty 's syndrome  ,  number of rehabilitation and rheumatology visits , test for inflammatory markers , number of chemistry panels/platelet counts ordered  and  rheumatoid factor test .  The correlation was low ( r=0.56 ) with an index previously vali date d by the same research group , the RA  medical records-based index of severity (  RARBIS  )  , with  Disease Activity Score-C-reactive protein ( DAS28-PCR )  ( r=0.07 ) and  Multidimensional Health Assessment Question naire ( MD-HAQ )  ( r=0.008 ) . Finally , the RARBIS , used to vali date the CIRAS , was devised as an  RA severity index  based on medical records . It includes as domains  surgery , radiology , extra-articular manifestations , clinical and laboratory variables  , previously chosen by an expert panel . RARBIS had a weak correlation with  treatment intensity  ( r=0.35 ) and with  DAS28  ( r=0.41 ) .  There is no index to assess the  severity  of  RA  based on the course of the first 2 years of follow-up that is adapted to the current strategy of therapeutic management of this disease . Therefore , we believe it is reasonable to develop a new ad hoc severity index for patients with early arthritis."
" The present systematic review is the most comprehensive summary of the evidence assessing the benefits and harms of  intermittent iron supplementation regimens  in  pregnant women  on  haematological and pregnancy outcomes .  The findings suggest that  intermittent iron+folic acid regimens  produce similar  maternal and infant outcomes  at birth as  daily supplementation  but are associated with fewer  side effects .  Women receiving daily supplements had increased risk of developing  high levels of Hb  in mid and late pregnancy but were less likely to present  mild anaemia  near term . Although the evidence is limited and the quality of the trials was low or very low , intermittent may be a feasible alternative to daily  iron  supplementation among those pregnant women who are not anaemic and have adequate antenatal care."
"  Celecoxib  may  improve clinical symptoms , alleviate pain  and contribute to little or no difference  in physical function  compared with  placebo . Celecoxib  was associated with fewer numbers of participant withdrawals . Results for  incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers  ( ≥ 3 mm ) and short-term  serious adverse events  were uncertain ; however , there were few reported events for either .  Celecoxib  may slightly  improve clinical symptoms  compared with tNSAIDs . Results  for reduced pain and improved physical function  were uncertain . Particpants taking  celecoxib  had lower  incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers  ( ≥ 3 mm ) and there were fewer withdrawals from trials . Results  for cardiovascular events and short-term serious adverse events  were also uncertain . Uncertainty about the rate of  cardiovascular events  between  celecoxib  and tNSAIDs could be due to risk of bias ; another factor is that these were small , short-term trials . It has been reported previously that both  celecoxib  and tNSAIDs  increase cardiovascular event rates  . Our confidence in results about harms is therefore low . Larger head-to-head clinical trials comparing  celecoxib  to other tNSAIDs is needed to better inform clinical practice."
"sAIM We aim ed to identify and evaluate the quality and evidence of the motor learning literature about intervention studies regarding the context ual interference ( CI ) effect ( blocked vs. r and  om  practice order ) in  children with brain lesions and typically developing ( TD ) children .  METHOD  Eight data  bases ( Cinahl , Cochrane , Embase , PubMed , Pedro , PsycINFO , Scopus and Web of Knowledge ) were search ed systematic ally with predefined search terms . Controlled studies examining the CI effect  in children ( with brain lesions or TD )  were included . Evidence level , conduct quality , and risk of bias were evaluated by two authors independently . A best evidence synthesis was performed . RESULTS  Twenty-five papers evaluating TD children were included .  One of these studies also assessed  children with cerebral palsy .  Evidence levels were I , II , or III . Conduct quality was low and the risk of bias high , due to method ological issues in the study design s or poor description thereof . Best evidence synthesis showed mainly no or conflicting evidence . Single tasks showed limited to moderate evidence supporting the  CI effect  in  TD children .   There is a severe limitation of good- quality evidence about the  CI effect  in  children  who  practice different tasks  in one session , especially in children with brain lesions."
"eBackground Asthma  self-management education  combining  with behavior therapy  is considered to be more effective .  Goal setting  is a common behavior change technique used to help  patients  self-manage their symptoms . However , empirical evidence around its effectiveness on asthma management lacks clarity . Aims To systematic ally integrate and appraise the evidence for effectiveness of  goal setting interventions  on asthma outcomes . Methods Data bases included CENTRAL , PubMed , EMBASE , CINAHL and Proquest Psychology Data base were systematic ally search ed for relevant intervention studies employing  goal setting technique as a method  in   asthma education program for  self-management  . Characteristic of studies and outcomes in clinical , psychosocial and healthcare utilization outcome were extracted . Results  From a total of 2641 citations , 45 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 9 studies met the inclusion criteria .  Eight studies were r and omized controlled trial and one was before-after study . None studies have a high method ological quality .  Goal - setting based intervention  appeared to improve  symptom control , quality of life and self-efficacy  in  adult patients with asthma .  Conclusion This systematic review highlighted the potential of a  goal setting technique  in the asthma self-management education . However , due to the limitations of the quality and quantity of the included literature , more rigorous studies are needed . In the future , better effective study protocol combining with  goal setting approach  and other behavior technique is needed to further investigate."

Methods this study ( PROSPERO registration CRD42019114736 ) aim ed to answer the question : "" Is  VR  beneficial for dual-task gait training  in patients with PD  ? "" We search ed for studies  from 2008 to 2018  on Medline / PubMed and Web of Science/Web of knowledge data bases . The keywords were Parkinson AND gait training AND  virtual reality  OR  Parkinson AND gait training  AND  game .  A  total of 55 articles were retrieved  , of  which 11 systematic  review s ,  11  opinions , letters to the editor , posters or conferences abstract s and  17 studies not evaluating  the  effects of  VR gait training   were excluded . Three further studies addressing  VR dual-task gait training  in PD ( found in references of studies selected ) were also included . Therefore , 19 studies were included and analysed . Results all studies reported  gait improvement  after  VR training  . Many  clinical scales  were used , hampering comparison of the effects of each protocol . Conclusion  VR dual-task gait training  should be part of rehabilitation protocol s for PD . The studies showed that  VR training  was effective , although specific guidelines have not yet been established."

"rResearch suggests that a  ' placebo '  can improve conditions common in primary care including  pain  ,  depression  and  irritable bowel syndrome .  However , disagreement persists over the definition and clinical relevance of placebo treatments . We conducted a meta-ethnographic , mixed- research systematic review to explore how  healthcare professionals and patients  underst and  placebos  and their effects in  primary care .  We conducted systematic literature search es of five data bases - augmented by reference chaining , key author search es and expert opinion - related to views on  placebos  , placebo effects and placebo use in  primary care . From a total of 34 eligible quantitative , qualitative and mixed- methods articles reporting findings from 28 studies , 21 were related to healthcare professionals ' views , 11 were related to patients ' views and two were related to both groups .  In the studies under review ,  healthcare professionals  reported using  placebos  at markedly different frequencies . This was highly influenced by how placebos were defined in the studies . Both  healthcare professionals and patients  predominantly defined  placebos  as material substances such as ' inert ' pills , despite this definition being inconsistent with current scientific thinking . However , healthcare professionals also , but less prevalently , defined  placebos  in a different way : as context ual processes . This better concurs with modern placebo definitions , which focus on context , ritual , meaning and enactivism . However , given the enduring ubiquity of substance definitions , for both  healthcare professionals and patients  , we question the practical , clinical validity of stretching the term  ' placebo '  towards its modern iteration . To produce ' placebo effects ' , therefore , primary healthcare professionals may be better off ab and oning placebo terminology altogether."
"dPresentatie gegeven over de review in Brussel Objectives : In the past decades many  psychosocial interventions  for  elderly people with dementia  have been developed and implemented . Relatively little research has been done on the extent to which these interventions were implemented in the daily care .

Using a modified RE- AIM framework , the indicators that are considered important for  effective and sustainable implementation  were defined."
"eCurrent evidence provides contradictory results in regards to the associations of  breastfeeding  or  early introduction of cow 's milk and formula  with the development of   type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) .   The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the  type of feeding ,  duration of breastfeeding  , time of  introduction  of  formula or cow 's milk   , and the  potential impact  on  developing T1D .  The literature search was conducted based on the st and ards outlined in the MOOSE Guidelines for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Review s of Observational Studies and yielded a total of  161 studies , 28 of which were included in this review . Twenty seven of the included studies were case-control and one was a prospect i ve cohort study .  Eight of the studies indicated breastfeeding has a protective role against the  development of T1D .  Seven additional studies emphasized that a short period or absence of breastfeeding could be a risk factor for  T1D development .  The results of this systematic review indicate a short duration and /or a lack of breastfeeding may constitute a risk factor for the  development of T1D  later in life."

"sCancer-related  fatigue ( CRF )  is common and can be distressing for some survivors  .  There is increasing interest in measuring levels of CRF , highlighting its impact on  quality of life .  This review describes the nature and scope of evidence relating to  interventions  for CRF . Scoping review methodology was used to identify studies , extract data , collate and summarise results . Data were collated according to cancer tumour streams , stage of illness and the types of trial interventions .  A total of 447 trials and 37 systematic review s met the inclusion criteria .  Nine papers reported longitudinal results .  Population s studied were predominantly of mixed cancer diagnoses and breast cancer .  The most frequent interventions were  exercise , pharmacological , psycho-education and mind-body interventions .   Fatigue  was identified as a primary outcome measure ( OM ) in 58 % of studies , with 58 different  fatigue measures  reported . Emerging evidence exists for the effectiveness of  fatigue  interventions for some cancer types . More research on interventions with participants with the same cancer type and illness phase is needed . Measurement of  severity and impact of CRF  using fewer , robust OMs will permit comparisons across studies."
" Beta-carotene and vitamin E  in doses higher than the RDA seem to  significantly increase mortality  , whereas we lack information on  vitamin A.  Dose of  vitamin  A was significantly associated with  increased mortality  in meta-regression . We lack information on doses below the RDA . BACKGROUND All essential compounds to stay healthy can not be synthesized in our body . Therefore , these compounds must be taken through our diet or obtained in other ways [ 1 ] .  Oxidative stress  has been suggested to cause a variety of diseases [ 2 ] . Therefore , it is speculated  that antioxidant supplements  could have a potential role in preventing  diseases and death  . Despite the fact that a normal diet in high-income countries may provide sufficient amounts of antioxidants [ 3,4 ] , more than one third of adults regularly  take antioxidant supplements  [ 5,6 ]."

"eThe  Early Nutrition Academy  supported a systematic review of human studies on the roles of pre- and postnatal  long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  ( LC-PUFA ) published from 2008 to 2013 and an expert workshop that review ed the information and developed recommendations , considering  particularly Asian population s.  An increased supply of  n-3 LC-PUFA  during pregnancy reduces the risk of preterm birth before 34 weeks of gestation .  Pregnant women  should achieve an additional supply ≥200  mg docosahexaenic acid (DHA)/day  , usually achieving a total intake ≥300 mg DHA/day . Higher intakes ( 600 - 800 mg DHA/day ) may provide greater protection  against early preterm birth .  Some studies indicate  beneficial effects of pre- and postnatal DHA supply on child neurodevelopment and allergy risk .  Breast-feeding is the best choice for infants .  Breast-feeding women  should get ≥200 mg DHA/day to achieve a human milk DHA content of ∼0.3 % fatty acids . Infant formula for  term infants  should contain  DHA and arachidonic acid ( AA  ) to provide 100 mg DHA/day and 140 mg AA/day . A supply of 100 mg DHA/day should continue during the second half of infancy . We do not provide quantitative advice  on AA levels  in follow-on formula fed after the introduction of complimentary feeding due to a lack of sufficient data and considerable variation in the AA amounts provided by complimentary foods . Reasonable intakes for very-low-birth weight infants are 18 - 60 mg/kg/day DHA and 18 - 45 mg/kg/day AA , while higher intakes ( 55 - 60 mg/kg/day DHA , ∼1 % fatty acids ; 35 - 45 mg/kg/day AA , ∼0.6 - 0.75 % ) appear preferable . Research on the requirements and effects of LC-PUFA during pregnancy , lactation , and early childhood should continue."
"sBackground  Ciclesonide  is a new inhaled corticosteroids licensed for the prophylactic treatment of  persistent asthma in adults .  Currently  beclomethasone dipropionate , budesonide and fluticasone propionate  are the most commonly prescribed inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma but there has been no systematic review comparing the effectiveness and  safety  ciclesonide to these agents . We therefore aim ed to systematic ally review published r and omised controlled trials of the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  ciclesonide  compared to alternative inhaled corticosteroids in  people with asthma .  Methods We performed literature search es on MEDLINE , EMBASE , PUBMED , the COCHRANE LIBRARY and various Internet evidence sources for r and omised controlled trials or systematic review s comparing  ciclesonide to beclomethasone or budesonide or fluticasone  in  adult humans with persistent asthma .  Data was extracted by one review er . Results  Five studies  met the inclusion criteria . Method ological quality was variable . There were no trials comparing  ciclesonide  to  beclomethasone .  There was no significant difference between  ciclesonide  and  budesonide  or  fluticasone  on the following outcomes :  lung function , symptoms , quality of life , airway responsiveness to a provoking agent or inflammatory markers .  However , the trials were very small in size , increasing the possibility of a type II error . One trial demonstrated that the combined  deposition of ciclesonide  ( and its active metabolite ) in the oropharynx was 47 % of that of  budesonide  while another trial demonstrated that the combined deposition of  ciclesonide  ( and its active metabolite ) in the oropharynx was 53 % of that of  fluticasone .  One trial demonstrated  less suppression of cortisol in overnight urine collection  after ciclesonide compared to fluticasone ( geometric mean fold difference = 1.5 , P < 0.05 ) but no significant difference in  plasma cortisol response .  Conclusion There is very little evidence comparing CIC to other ICS , restricted to very small , phase II studies of low power . These demonstrate CIC has similar  effectiveness  and  efficacy  to FP and BUD ( though equivalence is not certain ) and findings regarding oral deposition and HPA suppression are inconclusive . There is no direct comparative evidence that CIC causes fewer side effects since none of the studies reported patient-based outcomes."
"sPurpose : We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) to evaluate the effect of   high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC )  on reintubation in adult patients .  Procedures : Ovid Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s were search ed up to November 1 , 2016 , for RCTs comparing  HFNC  versus  conventional oxygen therapy ( COT )  or  noninvasive ventilation ( NIV )   in adult patients after extubation .  The primary outcome was  reintubation rate  , and the secondary outcomes included  complications , tolerance and comfort , time to reintubation , length of stay , and mortality .  Dichotomous outcomes were presented as  risk  ratio ( RR ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) and continuous outcomes as weighted mean difference and 95 % CIs . The r and om effects model was used for data pooling . Findings :  Seven RCTs involving 2781 patients  were included in the analysis . The  HFNC  had a similar  reintubation rate  compared to either  COT  ( RR , 0.58 ; 95 % CI , 0.21 - 1.60 ; P = .29 ; 5 RCTs , n = 1347 ) or  NIV  ( RR , 1.11 ; 95 % CI , 0.88 - 1.40 ; P = .37 ; 2 RCTs , n = 1434 ) . In subgroup  of critically ill patients  , the  HFNC  group had a significantly lower  reintubation rate  compared to the COT group ( RR , 0.35 ; 95 % CI , 0.19 - 0.64 ; P = .0007 ; 2 RCTs , n = 632 ; interaction P = .07 compared to postoperative subgroup ) . Qualitative analysis suggested that  HFNC  might be associated with  less complications and improved patient ’s tolerance and comfort .  The  HFNC  might not  delay reintubation  . Trial sequential analysis on the primary outcome showed that required information size was not reached . Conclusion : The evidence suggests that  COT  may still be the first-line therapy in  postoperative patients without acute respiratory failure .  However , in  critically ill patients  ,  HFNC  may be a potential alternative respiratory support to  COT and NIV  , with the latter often associating with patient intolerance and requiring a monitored setting . Because required information size was not reached , further high- quality studies are required to confirm these results."
"2OBJECTIVES To investigate and describe the content , dissemination and effects of  case management interventions  for  informal caregivers of older adults  , focusing on outcomes related to patients '  activities of daily living , nutrition assessment , pain measurement , depression , length of stay  and to  caregivers ' satisfaction and difficulties .  DESIGN This systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic . Review s and Meta- Analysis of studies that evaluate healthcare interventions ( PRISMA ) statement . DATA SOURCES  PubMed , CINAHL , and EMBASE were search ed in September 2013  using a two-step search strategy combining an electronic search with a search in the reference lists . The search strategy was structured using the study inclusion criteria built on PICOS . REVIEW METHODS Studies were review ed by title , abstract and full-text by both authors . Duplicates and studies not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded . Data was extracted from the eligible studies using narrative synthesis . The  Grading of Recommendations Assessment  , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach was employed to rate the quality of the evidence . RESULTS  Seven studies ( 5 RCTs ) including a total of 6956 patients over the age of 65 and their informal caregivers ( spouses , family members , and close relatives ) all in community-care setting s  were found eligible and included in the review . The assessment for risk of bias in the seven studies indicated variations in the study quality from very low ( n=4 ) , to low ( n=1 ) and moderate ( n=2 ) due to lack of r and omisation , blinding , transparency and not following intention to treat . A  case management approach  was cl aim ed in four studies and the remaining three studies used a  psycho-educational intervention with  core  components  of  case management  consistent with the literature . Significant effects of case management interventions were seen on  patients ' time to institutionalisation , municipal care costs and emotional health  when informal caregivers were involved . A significant effect was also found on  informal caregivers '  decrease in  depressive symptoms  over time .  Research of  case management interventions  for  informal caregivers  is very limited . This review identifies knowledge about  case management  as an intervention for  informal caregivers to older patients  , suggesting strengths and weaknesses for future interventions when informal caregivers are involved .

" The evidence did not provide conclusive results that  EBB plus EBRT  improved  symptom relief  over  EBRT  alone . We were not able to provide conclusive evidence to recommend  EBB  with  EBRT  ,  EBB  in preference to  EBRT , chemotherapy or Nd-YAG laser .  From heterogeneous information obtained from several small RCTs , we conclude that  EBRT  alone is more effective for palliation than  EBB  alone . For  patients previously treated by  EBRT  who are symptomatic from recurrent endobronchial central obstruction  ,  EBB  may be considered in selected cases."

"sPURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare  tissue-engineered bone using mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) and conventional bone grafts  in terms of  histomorphometric outcome , bone gained , and implant failure  in  the atrophic maxilla .  MATERIAL S AND METHODS A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) was conducted . An electronic search of several data bases was performed .  RCTs  comparing  tissue-engineered bone using MSCs to bone graft alone  in  rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla were included  . Outcome variables were a  mean percentage of new bone formation , residual graft particles , and connective tissue . Bone gained and implant failure rate  were also assessed .  Risk ratio (  RR ) or st and ardized mean differences ( SMD ) were statistically analyzed . RESULTS  A total of 190 augmented sites enrolled in 12 RCTs were included in  this study .  Nine of the 12 RCTs included 153 maxillary sinuses that underwent sinus elevation , and three RCTs included 28 patients with bone grafting only .  There was no significant increase in  new bone formation  between the two groups at 3 to 4 months ( SMD = -0.232 , CI , -0.659 to 0.195 , low- quality evidence ) . However , at 6 months postgrafting , a statistically significant increase in  new bone formation  was found in favor of the  tissue-engineered bone  using the MSC group ( SMD = 0.869 % , CI , -1.98 to 9.310 , moderate- quality evidence ) . No substantial difference was found between the two groups with respect to  residual graft particles , connective tissue , bone gained , and implant failure rate  ( RR = 2.8 , CI : 0.517 to 16.6 , P = .226 , very low- quality evidence ) .  There is moderate- to very low- quality evidence supporting the use of  tissue-engineered bone using MSC therapy  in maxillary  alveolar bone regeneration  compared with conventional bone grafting without MSCs."
" The hypothesis is thus partly proved in favor of  C-ACI/MACI  against  P-ACI  with weak evidence , in favor of accelerated weight bearing after  MACI  with strong evidence , and not in favor of arthroscopic and scaffold-based implantations because of unavailable evidence .

"dOBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of  structured physical exercise programs   during pregnancy  on the course of labor and delivery . STUDY DESIGN We conducted a systematic review and meta analysis using the following data sources : Medline and The Cochrane Library . In our study , we used r and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) that evaluated the effects of  exercise programs  during pregnancy on labor and delivery . The results are summarized as relative risks . RESULTS In the  16 RCTs that were included there were 3359 women .  Women in exercise groups had a significantly lower  risk of cesarean delivery  ( relative risk , 0.85 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.73 - 0.99 ) .  Birthweight  was not significantly reduced in exercise groups . The  risk of instrumental delivery  was similar among groups ( relative risk , 1.00 ; 95 % CI , 0.82 - 1.22 ) . Data on  Apgar score , episiotomy , epidural anesthesia , perineal tear , length of labor , and induction of labor  were insufficient to draw conclusions . With the use of data from  11 studies ( 1668 women )  , our analysis showed that women in the  exercise  groups  gained  significantly  less weight  than women in control groups ( mean difference , -1.13 kg ; 95 % CI , -1.49 to -0.78 ) .   Structured physical exercise  during pregnancy reduces the risk of  cesarean delivery .  This is an important finding to convince women to be active during their pregnancy and should lead the physician to recommend  physical exercise  to  pregnant women  , when this is not contraindicated."

"dPurpose of Review Recent studies have investigated the effect of treatments containing  adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( ADMSCs )  on  human  osteoarthritis .   These have mostly used biologic adjuvants which may influence results . Thus , the purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the current literature on these treatments when used in isolation . Recent Findings Five studies in this review used  cultured ADMSCs  , while four studies used  stromal vascular fraction  and three used  micro-fragmented adipose tissue to deliver ADMSCs .  No studies reported  serious treatment-related adverse effects  and all reported  improvements in clinical measures  for at least one dose . This was not necessarily reflected in  imaging evaluations  nor were improvements always maintained . Summary Current low-level evidence is limited due to variability in study methodology but indicates that treatments containing  ADMSCs  , when used in isolation , are  safe  and have the potential to  reduce pain and improve function .

The program of work , carried out in partnership with CLIC Sargent  ( a UK based cancer charity for children and young people )  was guided by The Behaviour Change Intervention Design Process . A systematic review of existing intervention studies was carried out and  TYACS  were surveyed on their interest in receiving health behaviour information and their preference regarding the format , delivery and timing of such information .  Health professionals  were also surveyed to gather their views on how health behaviour information would be best delivered to  young people with cancer .  The results of these studies informed the development of a collection of health behaviour change intervention re sources containing comprehensive lifestyle information and behaviour change support tools .  TYACS and TYA health professionals  were invited to review and provide feedback on the relevance , appeal and usability of the re sources . It is hoped that by involving TYACS and TYA representatives at every stage of intervention development the problem of  low uptake  and  adherence  commonly encountered during intervention piloting will be prevented . Abstract Background  Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivors ( TYACS )  are advised to adopt a healthy lifestyle in order to reduce the impact of cancer and its treatments upon their long-term health . However , at present there are no interventions available in the UK to support TYACS to lead a healthy lifestyle . To inform the development of a  lifestyle intervention  for TYACS a partnership was set up between academic behavioural scientists and CLIC Sargent ,  a cancer charity which supports children and young people .  Methods A series of studies to underst and patient and professionals needs and perspectives regarding  health behaviour  change were carried out .  TYACS  were surveyed to gather data on their current health behaviour status ; interest in , and experience of receiving , lifestyle advice ; and preference regarding the type , format , and delivery of a  lifestyle intervention .  Health care professionals were surveyed simultaneously to gather their views on how best to promote health behaviour change to TYACS . In this paper we summarise key findings from the development work , the result ing lifestyle intervention , and new data from a preliminary evaluation study exploring TYACS  and TYA health  professionals ’ views on the relevance  , appeal and usability  of the intervention re sources . Results A collection of health behaviour change intervention re sources containing lifestyle information and behaviour change support tools were developed . These intervention re sources were well received by  TYACS and health professionals  with the majority rating the information as high quality , helpful and relevant . Over 80 % of TYACS reported they would find the support tools ‘ very appealing ’ or ‘ quite appealing ’ . TYACS and health professionals provided feedback on how the re sources could be improved including commenting that more personalized or tailored health behaviour information would be beneficial . Discussion and conclusion It is hoped that by involving  TYACS  and  TYA  representatives at every stage of intervention development , and carrying out a preliminary evaluation of the intervention re sources , the problem of low uptake and adherence commonly encountered during formal intervention piloting and evaluation will be prevented."
" There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the use of  rehabilitation  to improve  on-road driving skills  after stroke . We found limited evidence that the use of a  driving simulator  may be beneficial in improving  visuocognitive abilities  , such as  road sign recognition  that are related to driving . Moreover , we were unable to find any RCTs that evaluated on-road driving lessons as an intervention . At present , it is unclear which impairments that influence driving ability after stroke are amenable to rehabilitation , and whether the context ual or remedial approaches , or a combination of both , are more efficacious."

"tThe value of warming-up is a worthy research problem because it is not known whether warming-up benefits , harms , or has no effect on individuals  .  The purpose of this study was to review the evidence relating to  performance improvement  using a  warm-up .  A systematic review and meta- analysis were undertaken . Relevant studies were identified by search ing Medline , SPORTD iscus , and PubMed ( 1966-April 2008 ) . Studies investigating the effects of warming-up on  performance improvement  in physical activities were included .  Studies were included only if the subjects were human and only if the warm-up included activities  other than  stretching  . The quality of included studies was assessed independently by 2 assessors using the Physiotherapy  Evidence Data base scale .   Thirty-two  studies , all of high quality ( 6.5 - 9 [ mean = 7.6 ] of 10 ) reported sufficient data ( quality score > 6 ) on the  effects  of  warming-up  on  performance improvement .  Warm-up was shown to improve  performance  in 79 % of the criterions examined . This analysis has shown that  performance improvements  can be demonstrated after completion of adequate warm-up activities , and there is little evidence to suggest that warming-up is detrimental to  sports participants .  Because there were few well-conducted , r and omized , controlled trials undertaken , more of these are needed to further determine the role of warming-up in relation to performance improvement."

"yPurpose It is unknown why some  breast cancer survivors  experience   cancer-related  cognitive impairments ( CRCI )  after  cancer treatment  , and modifiable risk factors for CRCI remain to be explicated . This mixed- method systematic review synthesizes quantitative and qualitative evidence for relationships between modifiable factors and CRCI in  breast cancer survivors who receive  chemotherapy  as part of their treatment .  Methods Keyword Search es of PubMed / Medline , PsychINFO , and CINAHL were performed for January 2005 through June  2015  . Studies that provided data on associations between modifiable biological , behavioral , environmental , and psychosocial factors and cognition were included . Results Twenty-two quantitative studies and five qualitative studies were identified after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria yielding evidence for significant relationships among  modifiable biological ( inflammatory cytokines ) , behavioral ( sleep quality , physical activity ) , and psychosocial ( stress , distress , affect ) factors  and CRCI . Conclusion Many women unfortunately experience CRCI after  breast cancer  chemotherapy , with limited treatment options available to improve  cognitive function .  This review synthesizes current evidence to support the associations between modifiable factors and CRCI and can inform research to evaluate these factors prospect ively . The clinical implication s of these findings suggest that lifestyle factors such as  physical activity , stress management , and sleep quality  may be appropriate targets for  behavioral interventions  to improve  cognitive function  following breast cancer chemotherapy ; however , further research is necessary."
  Iron supplementation  appears to prevent low  haemoglobin  at birth or at six weeks post-partum . There is very little information on pregnancy outcomes for either mother or baby . There are few data derived from communities where iron deficiency is common and anaemia is a serious health problem.
"dContinuous  positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) and noninvasive ventilation ( NIV )  are frequently used inhospital for treating  respiratory failure  , especially in  treatment  of  acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .  Early initiation of treatment is important for success and introduction already in the prehospital setting may be beneficial . Our goal was to assess the evidence for an effect of   prehospital  CPAP or NIV  as a supplement to st and ard medical treatment alone on the following outcome measures ;  mortality , hospital length of stay , intensive care unit length of stay , and intubation rate .  We undertook a systematic review based on a search in the three data bases : PubMed , EMBASE , and Cochrane . We included  12 studies in our review  , but only four of these were of acceptable size and quality to conclude on our endpoints of interest . All four studies examine  prehospital CPAP .  Of these , only one small , r and omized controlled trial shows a  reduced mortality rate  and a  reduced intubation rate  with supplemental  CPAP .  The other three studies have neutral findings , but in two of these a trend toward lower  intubation rate  is found . The effect of supplemental  NIV  has only been evaluated in smaller studies with insufficient power to conclude on our endpoints . None of these studies have shown an effect on neither  mortality nor intubation rate  , but two small , r and omized controlled trials show a reduction in  intensive care unit length of stay  and a  trend toward lower intubation rate .  The risk of both type two errors and publication bias is evident , and the findings are not consistent enough to make solid conclusion on supplemental  prehospital NIV .  Large , r and omized controlled trials regarding the effect of  NIV and CPAP  as supplement to st and ard medical treatment alone , in the prehospital setting , are needed."
" We conclude this amount  of weight loss  is achievable in the trial setting but is challenging in the clinical environment . High-intensity , multidisciplinary intervention in specialist clinics is likely to be required in order to manage NAFLD by lifestyle modification alone .

"bAim To evaluate  efficacy and safety  of  lapatinib or trastuzumab alone or both plus chemotherapy  for the treatment of  breast cancer patients with positive HER-2 expression .  Methods Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , PubMed , MEDLINE , OVID , Embase , Chinese Biomedical Literature Data base , and China Academic Journals Data base were search ed from 1994 through December 2017 using the keywords  ""  breast cancer ""  , "" preoperative "" , "" neo-adjuvant "" , "" lapatinib "" , "" pertuzumab "" , "" Herceptin "" , and "" trastuzumab "" .  Results Meta- analysis found that  pathological complete response ( PCR ;  risk ratio [RR]=0.82 , 95 % CI : 0.72 - 0.93 ) and  tall PCR  ( tPCR ; RR=0.77 , 95 % CI : 0.67 - 0.88 )  of chemotherapy plus  lapatinib were significantly less  effective or safe  compared to that  of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab  ( P<0.05 ) .  PCR  ( RR=1.30 , 95 % CI : 1.15 - 1.47 ) and  tPCR  ( RR=1.32 , 95 % CI : 1.16 - 1.50 )  of chemotherapy plus both  lapatinib  and trastuzumab  were significantly superior to that  of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab  alone ( P<0.05 ) . However , there was no significant difference  in breast reservation rate  between  chemotherapy plus  lapatinib  vs chemotherapy plus  trastuzumab ( RR=0.91 , 95 % CI : 0.72 - 1.16 ) or  chemotherapy plus  both lapatinib and trastuzumab ( RR=1.11 , 95 % CI : 0.73 - 1.68 , P>0.05 ) .  Incidence of diarrhea , hepatic toxicity , and skin rash  in the groups  of chemotherapy plus  lapatinib or  chemotherapy plus both  lapatinib and trastuzumab was significantly higher than that in  chemotherapy plus  trastuzumab ( P<0.05 ) . Conclusion Efficacy of lapatinib was less than that of trastuzumab , but incidence of adverse effect of lapatinib was higher than that of trastuzumab . Combination  of chemotherapy plus  both lapatinib  and  trastuzumab could significantly  increase PCR and tPCR  in breast cancer patients , but  rate of breast conservation , event-free survival , and overall survival  was not significantly improved .  Incidence of diarrhea , hepatic toxicity , and skin rash  was significantly increased in the groups using lapatinib."
 The findings of this study suggested  that NAC  is associated with significant improvement in the outcomes of survival and disease progression for  GC patients  while also increasing some toxicity.
 Evidence of low to moderate quality suggests that supplementing breast feeds by  cup  increases the  extent and duration of breast feeding .  Current insufficient evidence provides no basis for recommendations for a  tube alone  approach to supplementing breast feeds.
 : These results suggest that induction therapy with the addition of  taxane  is superior to induction  therapy  with  cisplatin and 5-flourouracil  in terms of  overall survival and progression-free survival .  The higher rate of  neutropenia  and neutropenic fever should be taken into consideration when making treatment decisions.
 Moderate quality evidence indicates that intramuscular  methotrexate  at a dose of 15 mg/week is superior to  placebo  for maintenance of remission in Crohn 's disease . Intramuscular  methotrexate  appears to be  safe .  Low dose oral  methotrexate  ( 12.5 to 15 mg/week ) does not appear to be effective for  maintenance of remission  in Crohn 's disease .  Combination therapy ( methotrexate and infliximab )  does not appear to be any more effective for  maintenance of remission  than  infliximab  monotherapy  .  The results for efficacy outcomes between  methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and 5-aminosalicylic acid  were uncertain . Large-scale studies of  methotrexate  given orally at higher doses for  maintenance of remission in  Crohn  's  disease may provide stronger evidence for the use of methotrexate in this manner.
" In  women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer  , ability to achieve surgery with complete cytoreduction ( no visible residual disease ) is associated with significant improvement in  overall survival .  However , in the absence of RCT evidence , it is not clear whether this is solely due to surgical effect or due to tumour biology . Indirect evidence would support surgery to achieve complete cytoreduction in selected women . The risks of major surgery need to be carefully balanced against potential benefits on a case-by-case basis."
"COBJECTIVE Early detection of peritoneal metastases ( PM ) of  colorectal cancer ( CRC )  is difficult and treatment options at a clinical ly overt stage are limited . Potentially ,  adjuvant laparoscopic hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC )  is of value . The aim of this study was to present  long term oncological outcomes  of a pilot study on  adjuvant HIPEC  to reduce development of PMCRC , with systematic review of literature . METHODS  Long term oncological outcomes  of  ten patients who underwent  laparoscopic HIPEC  within eight weeks after resection of primary CRC in the pilot study  were retrospectively collected . A systematic search of literature was performed on studies describing the use of  HIPEC  in  patients with CRC at high risk of developing PM .  RESULTS The median follow-up was 54 months ( range 49 - 63 ) . All patients were alive at the last follow-up moment and none of them had developed  PM .  Two patients had developed  pulmonary metastases .  Systematic review revealed five small cohort studies , including two matched comparisons .  Peritoneal recurrences  were found in 0 % to 9 % after  adjuvant HIPEC  , which was 28 % and 43 % in the two control groups , respectively .  Disease free and overall survival  were significantly higher in favour of  HIPEC .   Long term follow-up of ten patients included in a pilot study on  adjuvant HIPEC  revealed  no peritoneal recurrences .  This result is in line with other published pilot studies , a promising observation . However , the outcomes of the Dutch r and omized COLOPEC trial and similar trials worldwide should be awaited for definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of adjuvant HIPEC."

"hBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer for  women  regardless of  race/ethnicity . Women of color  are diagnosed at later stages and experience greater mortality than their White counterparts . However , there has been comparatively little research on coping with breast among  racial/ethnic minorities  at time of diagnosis , during treatment , or in the course of survivorship . This is despite the fact that research has repeatedly shown that distress can impact disease progression and survival . The questions asked of this systematic literature review include : ( 1 ) What is known about coping with breast cancer among  major racial/ethnic groups  ? ( 2 ) What are the strengths and gaps in research to date ?  Over 120 peer- review ed published studies ( 1980–2012 ) were review ed .  A total of  33 met criteria for  inclusion including  15 quantitative ,  17  qualitative , and 1  mixed methods study . The majority of studies were small sample cross-sectional studies . Only five studies were longitudinal , and two r and omized-controlled intervention trials sought to improve coping among survivors . The most common topic in both quantitative and qualitative studies was  spirituality  and coping among  African American breast cancer patients . Thirteen studies included Latinas only or in combination with other groups .  Only one quantitative and one qualitative study solely addressed the  Asian American population  exploring coping and adjustment . In the course of this systematic literature review , we eluci date what is known about coping with breast cancer  among racial/ethnic minority women  and identify priorities for future research."
"dBackground  Acupuncture  has been suggested as a treatment for  stroke  rehabilitation , but the question whether it is effective has not been answered satisfactorily . Purpose To summarise and critically review all r and omised controlled trials of the effectiveness of  acupuncture  as a treatment for  stroke  . Methods Four independent computerised literature search es ( in MEDLINE , Cochrane Controlled Trials Register , Embase , and CISCOM data bases ) were conducted in June 1999 . All r and omised-controlled trials that compared any form of  needle insertion acupuncture  to any  form of non-acupuncture control intervention  in the treatment of  human stroke patients  were included . Data were extracted independently by two authors and arbitrated by a third . The method ological quality of the included studies was assessed using the  Jadad score .  Results  Nine r and omised controlled trials with a total sample size of 538 patients were included .  Two studies were assessor blind , one was subject blind , and one was assessor and subject blind . Two studies exclusively used  manual acupuncture  , five only  electro-acupuncture  , and two used both . Outcome measures used were  Sc and inavian Stroke Scale , Chinese Stroke Scale or Recovery Scale , Barthel index , Nottingham Health Profile , Motor function , balance , and days in hospital .  Of the nine studies , six yielded a positive result suggesting that  acupuncture  is effective , and three produced a negative finding implying that acupuncture is not superior to control treatment . Only two studies obtained a  Jadad score  of more than 3 . These method ologically best trials showed no significant  effect of  acupuncture .   Conclusion Based on the evidence of rigorous r and omised controlled trials , there is no compelling evidence to show that  acupuncture  is effective in stroke rehabilitation . Further , better- design ed studies are warranted."

"yBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The evidence for the efficacy of the adjunctive use of  platelet-rich plasma ( PRP )  in  periodontal intraosseous defects  has not been systematic ally evaluated . The objective of this review was to address the focused question , ' What is the  efficacy , with respect to clinical , radiographical and patient-centred outcomes  , of combinations of  PRP  with other therapeutic bioactive agents/ procedures , compared with the efficacy of the same agents/ procedures without the adjunctive use of  PRP  in the therapy of  periodontal intraosseous defects in patients with chronic periodontitis and without systemic diseases that could  potentially  influence the outcome of periodontal therapy  ? ' by performing a systematic review of r and omized controlled clinical trials ( RCTs ) published in the dental literature in  any language  , up to  and including  September 2008 . MATERIAL AND METHODS Data sources principally included electronic data bases , manually search ed journals and contact with experts . In the first phase of study selection , the titles and abstract s , and in the second phase , full papers were screened independently and in duplicate by two review ers . RESULTS In the first phase ,  6124 potentially relevant titles and abstract s  were  examined  . In the second phase , the full text of 20 publications was thoroughly evaluated . Eventually , 10 RCTs were selected .  Diverse outcomes ( positive and negative ) have been reported for the efficacy of  PRP  combined with various therapeutic bioactive agents/ procedures , reflecting the limited and heterogeneous data available and possibly suggesting that the specific selection of agents/ procedures combined with  PRP  could be important . Additional research on the efficacy of each specific combination of  PRP  is necessary."
" Theophylline has a modest effect on  FEV1 and FVC  and slightly improves  arterial blood gas tensions  in moderate to severe COPD . These benefits were seen in  patients receiving  a variety of different  concomitant therapies  . Improvement in  exercise performance  depended on the method of testing . There was a very low dropout rate in the studies that could be included in this review , which suggests  that recruited  patients may have been known by the investigators to be theophylline tolerant . This may limit the generalisability of these studies."

" There are insufficient RCT data to evaluate the use of oral anti-diabetic agents in  women with established diabetes , impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes who are planning a pregnancy , or in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes .  Low to very low- quality evidence suggests possible reductions in  pregnancy-induced hypertension , caesarean section birth and neonatal hypoglycaemia  with  metformin  compared with  insulin  for  women with type 2 diabetes diagnosed before or during their pregnancy  , and no clear differences in  pre-eclampsia , induction of labour and babies that are large-for-gestational age .  Further high- quality RCTs that compare any combination of oral anti-diabetic agent , insulin and dietary and lifestyle advice for these women are needed . Future RCTs could be powered to evaluate effects on short- and long-term clinical outcomes ; such RCTs could attempt to collect and report on  the st and ard outcomes  suggested in this review . We have identified three ongoing studies and four are awaiting classification . We will consider these when this review is up date."
"dBACKGROUND Recently there is a focus on the  antioxidants  as adjuvant treatment of  polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS )  , the most endocrinopathy in  reproductive age women .  OBJECTIVE The aim of this review is answer to the question whether  antioxidants  are effective for managing of hormonal and metabolic problems in  women with PCOS based on first degree evidence s from Iran .  MATERIAL S AND METHODS A systematic review of clinical trials was done in  Persian and international data bases  including PubMed , Scientific Information Data base , Google Scholar , Iran  Medex  , and  Magiran  up  to 2013 .  Keywords were including polycystic ovary syndrome , Iran , vitamin ,  antioxidant .  From  440 potential studies found electronically , 11 studies ; including 444 women in intervention and 390 women in control groups .  Intervention in three studies was  Calcium-vitamin D or calcitriol ;  in three studies was  ω-3 fatty acids ;  in two studies was  N-acetyl cysteine ;  in one study was  folic acid ;  in one study was  Zinc ;  and in one study was  Soy .  RESULTS Finally , 11 studies that were relevant and met the inclusion criteria review ed . There were  7 studies in English and 4 studies in Persian .  We could n't include all studies because all full texts were not accessible .  The results showed that  antioxidants and vitamins  have positive  effects  on management of  PCOS women .  Although it seems more studies is necessary in this field."
" This review complements data on post-operative  nausea  and vomiting suggesting a biologic effect of  acupuncture-point stimulation . Electroacupuncture  has demonstrated benefit for chemotherapy-induced acute vomiting , but studies combining electroacupuncture with state-of-the-art antiemetics and in  patients with refractory symptoms  are needed to determine clinical relevance .  Self-administered acupressure  appears to have a protective  effect  for  acute nausea  and can readily be taught to patients though studies did not involve placebo control .  Noninvasive electrostimulation  appears unlikely to have a clinical ly relevant impact when patients are given state-of-the-art pharmacologic antiemetic therapy."

"gWe included  34 trials with 3742 participants  , identified through 6 data base and supplementary search es ( to May 2017 ) : 29 were r and omised ; 4 were quasi-r and omised and 1 was cluster-r and omised . Disparate measurements and outcomes precluded meta-analyses . Blinding was attempted in only 6 out of 34 ( 18 % ) trials .  A multimedia format , alone or in combination with text or verbal formats  , was studied in 20/34 ( 59 % ) trials : pre-operative  anxiety  was unaffected in 10 out of 14 trials and reduced by the  multimedia  format in three ;  postoperative anxiety  was unaffected in four out of five trials in which formats were compared .  Multimedia  formats increased  knowledge  more than text , which in turn increased  knowledge  more than verbal formats . Other outcomes were unaffected by information format . The timing of information did not affect  pre-operative anxiety , postoperative pain or length of stay .  In conclusion , the effects of pre-operative information on  peri-operative anxiety  and  other outcomes  were affected little by format or timing."

" For  adolescents and adults with persistent asthma  , with  suboptimal asthma control  with daily use of ICS , the addition of anti-leukotrienes is beneficial for reducing  moderate and severe asthma exacerbations  and for improving  lung function and asthma control  compared with the same dose of  ICS .  We can not be certain that the addition of anti-leukotrienes is superior , inferior or equivalent to a higher dose of ICS  .  Scarce available evidence does not support anti-leukotrienes as an ICS sparing agent , and use of LTRAs was not associated with increased  risk of withdrawals or adverse effects  , with the exception of an increase in  serious adverse events  when the ICS dose was tapered . Information was insufficient for assessment of mortality."
"sBACKGROUND Hepatitis A and B are two of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccination for Hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) and hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is recommended for those at risk of contracting HAV and /or HBV through their occupation , travel or lifestyle . OBJECTIVE To describe the  vaccine efficacy , immunogenicity , effectiveness  and  safety  of the combined vaccine against hepatitis A  and hepatitis  B. METHODS A systematic review of the  literature published between 1990 and 2015 .  RESULTS  Anti-HAV seropositivity rates  ranged from 96.2 % to 100 % and  anti-HBs seroprotection rates  from 82 % to 100 % .  Antibodies  persisted up to 15 years and  geometric mean concentration ( GMC )  remained above the seropositivity cut-off value for both .  Anti-HAV and anti-HBs immune responses  were lower in less immunocompetent individuals one month after completion of the immunization schedule . The  safety profiles   of Twinrix(TM )  and  monovalent hepatitis  A  and  B vaccines were similar .  The vaccine offers satisfactory  long-term immunogenicity rates  , expected  duration of protection  and  safety profile  similar to the monovalent hepatitis A or B vaccines."

 This review found no evidence that any glucose monitoring technique is superior to any other technique among  pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes .  The evidence base for the effectiveness of monitoring techniques is weak and additional evidence from large well- design ed r and omised trials is required to inform choices of glucose monitoring techniques.
"eBACKGROUND Adequate asthma treatment of  childhood  exacerbations with IV  aminophylline  depends on appropriate dosage . Recommendations to aim for a target therapeutic range may be inappropriate as serum concentrations correlate poorly with clinical improvement . This review aims to evaluate the evidence for the optimum dosage strategy of  intravenous aminophylline  in  children suffering an exacerbation of asthma .  METHODS A systematic review comparing dosage regimens of  intravenous aminophylline  in  children suffering an exacerbation of asthma .  Primary outcomes were  time until resolution of symptoms , mortality and need for mechanical ventilation .  Secondary outcomes were  date until discharge criteria  are met ,  actual discharge and adverse effects .  DATA SOURCES CENTRAL , CINAHL , MEDLINE and Web of Science . Search performed in March 2016 . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies using intravenous  aminophylline  in  children with an acute exacerbation of asthma  which reported the dosage and clinical outcomes . FINDINGS 14 RCTs were included . There is a poor relationship between the dosage administered to children and  symptom resolution , length of stay or need for mechanical ventilation .  This study is limited due to its use of indirect evidence .  The currently recommended dosage regimens may not represent the optimum safety and efficacy of intravenous  aminophylline .  There is a need to develop the evidence base correlating dosage with patient centered clinical outcomes , to improve prescribing practice."
"sGreater underst and ing of the mechanisms ( mediators ) by which   behavioral-change interventions   work is critical to developing theory and refining interventions . Although systematic review s have been advocated as a method for exploring mediators , this is rarely done . One challenge is that intervention research ers typically test only two paths of the mediational model : the effect of the intervention on mediators and on outcomes . The authors addressed this challenge by drawing information not only from  intervention  studies but also from observational studies that provide data on associations between potential mediators and outcomes . They also review ed qualitative studies of  participants ’  perceptions of why and how interventions worked . Using  data from  intervention  ( n = 37 ) and quantitative observational studies ( n = 55 )  , the authors conducted a meta- analysis of the mediation  effects  of eight variables . Qualitative findings ( n = 6 ) contributed to more in-depth explanations for findings . The methods used have potential to contribute to underst and ing of core mechanisms of behavioral-change interventions."
" In  people with COPD  ,  PDE4 inhibitors  offered benefit over  placebo  in  improving lung function  and  reducing the likelihood of exacerbations ;  however , they had little impact on  quality of life  or  symptoms . Gastrointestinal adverse effects and weight loss  were common , and safety data su bmi tted to the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) have raised concerns over  psychiatric adverse events  with roflumilast . The findings of this review give cautious support to the use of  PDE4 inhibitors  in COPD . They may be best used as add-on therapy in a subgroup of people with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite optimal COPD management . This is in accordance with the GOLD 2017 guidelines . Longer-term trials are needed to determine whether or not  PDE4 inhibitors  modify  FEV1 decline , hospitalisation or mortality  in COPD."
 Meta- analysis supported a positive treatment effect for the  use of acupuncture  when used as adjunctive  therapy  in patients with angina due to CAD.
 : A significant correlation  between increased FEV1 and lower  COPD  exacerbation risk  suggests  that airway  patency is an important mechanism responsible for this effect.
"DBACKGROUND Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) is a debilitating behavioural disorder affecting daily ability to function , learn , and interact with peers . This publication assesses the role of  omega-3/6 fatty acids  in the treatment and management of ADHD  .  METHODS A systematic review of  16 r and omised controlled trials  was undertaken . Trials included a total of  1,514 children and young people with ADHD  who were allocated to take an  omega-3/6 intervention , or a placebo .  RESULTS Of the studies identified , 13 reported favourable benefits on  ADHD symptoms  including  improvements in hyperactivity , impulsivity , attention , visual learning , word reading , and working/short-term memory .  Four studies used supplements containing a 9 : 3 : 1 ratio of  eicosapentaenoic acid : docosahexaenoic acid : gamma linolenic acid  which appeared effective at improving  erythrocyte levels .  Supplementation with this ratio of fatty acids also showed promise as an adjunctive  therapy  to  traditional medications  ,  lowering the dose and improving the compliance with medications such as  methylpheni date  .   ADHD is a frequent and debilitating childhood condition . Given disparaging feelings towards psychostimulant medications  , omega-3/6 fatty acids  offer great promise as a suitable adjunctive therapy for ADHD."
"sPURPOSE Underst and ing the effectiveness of  complex , face-to-face health behaviour change interventions  requires high- quality measures to assess fidelity of delivery and engagement . This systematic review aim ed to ( 1 ) identify the types of measures used to monitor fidelity of  delivery of , and engagement with , complex , face-to-face health behaviour change interventions  and ( 2 ) describe the reporting of psychometric and implementation qualities . METHODS Electronic data bases were search ed , systematic review s and reference lists were h and - search ed , and 21 experts were contacted to identify articles . Studies that quantitatively measured fidelity of delivery of , and /or  engagement  with , a complex ,  face-to-face health behaviour change intervention for adults  were included . Data on interventions , measures , and psychometric and implementation qualities were extracted and synthesized using narrative analysis . RESULTS  Sixty-six studies were included :  24 measured both  fidelity of delivery and engagement  , 20 measured  fidelity of delivery  , and 22 measured  engagement .  Measures of fidelity of delivery included  observation  ( n = 17 ; 38.6 % ) ,  self-report  ( n = 15 ; 34 % ) ,  quantitatively rated qualitative interviews  ( n = 1 ; 2.3 % ) , or  multiple measures  ( n = 11 ; 25 % ) . Measures of engagement included  self-report  ( n = 18 ; 39.1 % ) ,  intervention records  ( n = 11 ; 24 % ) , or  multiple measures  ( n = 17 ; 37 % ) . Fifty-one studies ( 77 % ) reported at least one  psychometric or implementation quality ;  49 studies ( 74.2 % ) reported at least one  psychometric  quality , and 17 studies ( 25.8 % ) reported at least one  implementation quality .   Fewer than half of the review ed studies measured both  fidelity of delivery of , and engagement  with complex , face-to-face health behaviour change interventions . More studies reported psychometric qualities than implementation qualities . Interpretation of intervention outcomes from  fidelity of delivery  and engagement measurements may be limited due to a lack of reporting of psychometric and implementation qualities . Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject ? Evidence of fidelity and engagement is needed to underst and effectiveness of complex interventions Evidence of fidelity and engagement are rarely reported High- quality measures are needed to measure  fidelity  and engagement What does this study add ? Evidence that indicators of quality of measures are reported in some studies Evidence that psychometric qualities are reported more frequently than implementation qualities A recommendation for intervention evaluations to report indicators of quality of  fidelity  and engagement measures."
"sDear Editor : We read with interest the network meta- analysis by Riboh and colleagues titled ‘ ‘ Effect of Leukocyte Concentration on the Efficacy of  Platelet-Rich Plasma  in the Treatment of  Knee Osteoarthritis  , ’ ’ which compared intra-articular injection of  leukocyte-rich platelet-rich plasma ( LR-PRP ) , leukocyte-poor platelet-rich plasma ( LP-PRP ) , and hyaluronic acid ( HA )  for  treatment of knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) .  While the authors should be applauded for the considerable effort involved in the conduct of this research , the methodology and conclusions are question able and warrant further clarification . The primary concern relates to the paucity of available data . The number of studies reporting  Western Ontario  and  McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) outcome scores  were 3 for  HA  , 1 for  LR-PRP  , 3 for  LP-PRP  , and 1 for  placebo .  Similarly ,  International Knee Documentation Committee ( IKDC ) scores  were provided in 2 HA studies , 3 LR-PRP studies , 2 LP-PRP studies , and 1  placebo  study . Lastly , adverse reactions were included for 2 LR-PRP studies , 3 LP-PRP studies , 4  HA  studies , and 1  placebo  study . Our view is that no valid conclusions can be derived from a network meta- analysis with such limited data . A second concern relates to the method of  analyzing WOMAC and IKDC data .  For each outcome , the reported statistic was the absolute change from baseline to final follow-up . Yet mean baseline scores in the included studies ranged from 39 to 80 for  WOMAC  and from 41 to 56 for  IKDC .  Given these differences in baseline symptom severity among studies , a given absolute  WOMAC improvement  from a baseline score of 39 has a vastly different interpretation than the same absolute improvement from a baseline of 80 . In fact , the likely reason that  LP-PRP  was deemed most efficacious was because the study with the greatest  WOMAC improvement  also had an unusually high  baseline WOMAC score .  A third concern relates to study selection criteria and heterogeneity in patient characteristics . Each of the 3  LR-PRP  studies that reported  IKDC scores  were performed by the same group using the same protocol involving repeat injections with devitalized freeze-thawed PRP , which is not characteristic of clinical practice . Comparing outcomes from studies using freshly isolated  LP-PRP  comprising living cells with studies that used freezethawed LR-PRP containing dead cells is not appropriate . In addition , the study by Patel et al that compared 1 versus 2  PRP  injections in bilateral  OA patients  and the study by Kon et al that compared lowversus high-molecularweight HA should have been excluded based on the authors ’ study selection criteria ( exclusion 3 ) . An example of the deleterious synergistic effects of these concerns relative to  WOMAC scores  is demonstrated in Table 1 , which shows extremely limited data and tremendous differences in baseline symptom severity such that reporting absolute improvement as the outcome of interest is flawed and pooling data among studies is question able . The main findings of this network meta analysis are dominated by outcomes where no or limited direct evidence is available , which suggests high risk of bias . Inclusion of nonr and omized trials in this systematic review compounds this risk . Finally , since all  surface under the cumulative ranking curve ( SUCRA )  data were derived from the pooled meta- analysis data that suffer from these same data limitations , the SUCRA data should be considered unreliable . In summary , a more appropriate conclusion to this manuscript would have been that conduct of a network meta analysis is inappropriate and no reasonable conclusions can be drawn regarding the  effect of leukocyte concentration  on the  safety and efficacy  of  PRP  in knee osteoarthritis."
"yThis study aim ed to evaluate the effects of  exercise  on  weight gain  and  perinatal outcomes  among  overweight and obese pregnant women  , through a systematic review in MEDLINE / PubMed , EMBASE , LILACS , and SciELO . We included ten clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of  exercise with or without combined diet  in the control of  gestational weight gain .  Three studies were r and omized , and method ological quality was assessed using the CONSORT 2010 Checklist , but none met all the criteria . Four studies  showed weight gain  differences between groups . The majority ( 60 % ) of studies showed no  differences  in  perinatal outcomes ( mode of delivery , gestational age at birth , birth weight )  . In conclusion , few studies confirmed the positive effect of  exercise  in controlling  weight gain  during pregnancy , thus requiring more research in this direction . Regarding  perinatal outcomes  ,  mild to moderate exercise  does not appear to be decisive for perinatal outcomes , and is safe for pregnant women with overweight and obesity."
"gAIMS AND OBJECTIVES To review  communication interventions  that aim to improve regular  care interactions  between  people with dementia and their carers  in various setting s ; and to examine the impact of such interventions on both carer and care-receiver outcomes . BACKGROUND Effective communication is imperative to ensure quality of care for  people living with dementia .  Due to neurodegenerative changes ,  people with dementia  encounter ongoing and progressive difficulties in both underst and ing and expressing themselves . This in turn creates challenges for carers , which highlights the need for equipping them with necessary communication skills to respond to the specific communication needs of people with dementia  .  DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis . METHOD Medline , Embase , CINAHL , ProQuest and PsycINFO data bases were search ed for eligible interventions with any date of the publication . H and search ing was also conducted through review ing the reference lists of relevant articles . The screening and selection of studies were based on the inclusion /exclusion criteria for eligibility and the method ological quality assessment checklist . R and om-effects meta-analyses were conducted on comparable quantitative data . The review is reported following the PRISMA reporting guidelines . RESULTS  Seventeen studies were included in the final review , including 12 r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) , three nonr and omised controlled trials ( N RCTs )  and two  controlled  before-after  interventions  . The intervention design s , setting s and outcome measures were varied . The findings suggest that the  communication training  had a positive impact on both  carer and care-receiver outcomes  , albeit to different degrees . The intervention effects were found to be strongest on carer communication skills and knowledge .  There is solid evidence for the positive impact of  communication training  on the skills and knowledge of carers . More research is needed regarding the effects of such educational interventions on  carer physio-psychological outcomes  and  care-receiver neuropsychiatric symptoms .  It is important to establish best practice s in training design , develop vali date d outcome measures and adopt consistent reporting approaches . RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The increasing global prevalence of people with dementia manifests across clinical and community context s. The profound impact of dementia on communication and associated care raises the imperative for enhanced health worker and carer communication skills to meet the needs of this particular client group . The findings of this review indicate that  educational interventions  incorporating face-to-face and diverse instructional delivery methods in dementia communication showed positive outcomes for  communication skills  in all carer groups and warrant inclusion as strategies in dementia training."
" Evidence of variable quality suggests that  dietary advice  with or without  oral nutritional supplements  may improve  weight , body composition and grip strength .  We found no evidence of benefit of  dietary advice  or  oral nutritional supplements  given alone or in combination on  survival .  Studies addressing the impact of nutritional interventions on nutritional , functional and patient-centred outcomes are needed."
"nThere is a longst and ing debate whether allowing safety-seeking behaviors ( SSBs ) during  cognitive-behavioral treatment  hampers or facilitates the  reduction of fear .  In this meta- analysis , we evaluate the impact of  SSBs  on   exposure-based  fear reduction  interventions .   After  filtering 409 journal articles , 23 studies were included for systematic review  of which  20 studies  were coded for  meta-  analysis . For each study , the St and ardized  Mean Difference ( SMD or Hedges ' g ) of self-reported fear  was calculated at post-intervention . Two comparisons were distinguished : I )  exposure without safety-seeking behavior ( SSB- ) versus baseline behavior (  BL  )  , and II )  exposure with safety-seeking behavior ( SSB+ ) versus BL  . The results showed that  average effect sizes  were in favor of  SSB-  , ( I : SMD=0.31 , 95 % CI [ -0.04 , 0.66 ] ) , and in favor of BL , ( II : SMD=-0.13 , 95 % CI [ -0.37 , 0.11 ] ) . Neither of the  effect sizes  were statistically significant ( I : Z=1.75 , p=.08 ; II : Z=1.07 , p=.28 ) . The current meta- analysis could not provide compelling evidence supporting either the removal or addition of  SSB  during exposure . More systematic and statistically empowered replications , using comparable research methods , in ( non- ) clinical setting s are needed . Novel insights from fear conditioning research may also shed light on the role of  SSB  in fear reduction."
" The addition of  platinum-based chemotherapy to radiotherapy  may offer clinical benefit in the adjuvant treatment of  early stage cervical cancer  with risk factors for recurrence .

 : Administering a high dose ( > 3.0 g/kg/day ) or an early dose ( ≤24 h ) of  parenteral amino acids  is  safe and well tolerated  but does  not offer significant benefits on growth .  Further large-scale r and omized controlled trials in preterm infants are needed to study the effects of early and high-dose  amino acids  on  growth and morbidity  more consistently and extensively.
">PURPOSE The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of  family support programs  on  caregiving burden , depression , and stress  in  family caregivers of people with dementia .  METHODS A literature search was conducted of electronic data bases to identify  r and omized controlled studies with  family support programs  done between 2000 and 2014 . Studies published in English and /or Korean  were included for the analysis with search strategies adapted from the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group . Studies were rated for quality assessment by two independent review ers using the appraisal checklist developed by Cochrane Review s and Dissemination .  Of 8,334 articles identified in the literature search , full texts of 76 articles that met the inclusion criteria were review ed and 38 were found to include relevant outcomes .  RESULTS Results from selected studies were pooled in statistical meta- analysis using Review Manager Software and heterogeneity between combined studies was assessed using the Chi-square test . Meta- analysis showed that the  effect sizes   of family caregiver support programs  were small to  medium  for categories  of caregiving burden  ( Hedge 's g=-0.17 , 95 % CI=-0.30~-0.04 )  , depression  ( Hedge 's g=-0.30 , 95 % CI=-0.40~-0.20 ) ,  and stress  ( Hedge 's g=-0.39 , 95 % CI=-0.52~-0.25 ) .  The review results indicate  that a support programs  can  assist family caregivers  in reducing their psycho-emotional  distress ."
"dObjective To review the available evidence and make recommendations regarding use of  systemically administered drugs in combination or in sequence with radiation ( RT ) and /or surgery  for cure and /or organ preservation in  patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic ( Stage III to IVB ) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( LASCCHN ) .  Method Recognizing the Meta- analysis of  Chemotherapy  in Head and Neck Cancer ( MACH-NC ) group reports have de facto guided practice since 2000 , we search ed for systematic review s in the MEDLINE , EMBASE and Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s published from January 2000 to February 2015 in reference to 4 research questions . A search was also conducted for r and omized trials ( RCTs ) up to February 2015 not included in the meta-analyses . Result The MACH-NC reports , 5  additional meta-analyses  , and  30 RCTs  not included by MACH-NC were identified . For  chemotherapy  , MACH-NC findings showing improved  overall survival  with concomitant chemoRT did not require modification . High-dose  cisplatin  was most commonly studied . We confirmed this benefit with  cisplatin  monotherapy in  patients treated with with postoperative concurrent  chemoRT .   Other than cetuximab , no targeted agents and radiosensitizers studied in RCTs were shown effective  . TPF induction chemotherapy  was superior to  PF for tumor response and larynx preservation but not survival . Larynx preservation  was reported with both CRT and induction  chemotherapy  approaches . Conclusion  ChemoRT  with  cisplatin  at least 40 mg/m2 per week given as radical or postoperative adjuvant remains a st and ard treatment approach for LASCCHN that improves  overall survival but increases toxicity .   5-FU plus platinum  is supported by less data but may be a reasonable alternative for patients unsuitable for  cisplatin .  Of note , stratification of outcomes by HPV-status was not available but outcomes for oropharynx cancer appeared similar to other subsites in chemoRT RCTs . No RCTs have yet demonstrated superiority or non-inferiority of cetuximab-RT to CRT . In view of this ,  cetuximab-RT  is suggested only for patients not c and i date s for  CRT  .  Taxane-based triplet induction chemotherapy  is superior to doublets for rapid tumour downsizing and for larynx preservation , but does not improve  overall survival  and should be used with primary G-CSF prophylaxis . Further investigation of induction approaches for larynx preservation may be warranted."
"dThe recent  hidradenitis suppurativa ( HS )  Cochrane review identified outcome measure heterogeneity as an important issue to address when design ing future HS trials . Our objective was to follow the Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema ( HOME ) roadmap , by performing a systematic review of HS outcome measure instruments to inform the development of an HS core outcome set . We performed a systematic review to identify validation evidence for outcome measure instruments used in  HS r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs )  , and assessed the method ological quality of all HS outcome measure validity studies using the COnsensus-based St and ards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments ( COSMIN ) checklist . The  12 RCTs included in the Cochrane review utilized 30  outcome measure  instruments , including 16  physician-reported instruments  , 11  patient-reported instruments  and three  composite measures  containing   elements of both  . Twenty-seven ( 90 % ) of the instruments lacked any  validation  data . Two further instruments have been developed and partially vali date d. Of the seven studies meeting our inclusion criteria , six were of ' fair ' or ' poor ' method ological quality , in part because most of the studies were not primarily design ed for instrument validation . The HiSCR instrument is supported by good- quality validation data , but there are gaps , including assessment of  internal consistency , inter-rater reliability and minimal clinical ly important difference  ,  and convergent validity  fell below the acceptable range for some comparisons . Multiple , usually unvali date d , outcome measure instruments have been used in HS RCTs . Where validation evidence is available there are issues of low method ological quality or incomplete  validity assessment  and so , currently , no instruments can be fully recommended."
"yPURPOSE To conduct a systematic review to determine the most effective therapy for  patients with unresected stage III non-small cell lung cancer .  METHODS Relevant r and omized trials and meta-analyses were identified through a systematic search of the literature . RESULTS  Forty-seven trials  and six meta-analyses were included . No statistically significant  survival differences  were detected for immediate versus delayed administration  of radiotherapy  or different  doses of hyperfractionated radiotherapy .  Three of 12 trials comparing various doses and schedules of  radiotherapy  detected a statistically significant  survival advantage  with higher radiation doses . All meta-analyses found a statistically significant  survival advantage  for  chemoradiation  , particularly  platinum-based  , compared with  radiation alone .  One meta- analysis and three trials comparing concurrent with  sequential chemoradiation  detected a statistically significant  survival advantage  with concurrent administration .  Increased toxicities , especially esophagitis and hematologic events  , were generally associated with concurrent  chemoradiation .  The  survival advantage  for  concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation  corresponds to a 4 % absolute  survival benefit  at 2 years . With respect to trials comparing different chemotherapy regimens or schedules , there is insufficient evidence to determine which particular regimen or schedule is most effective .   Palliative radiotherapy  can provide  symptom relief  for  symptomatic patients with poor performance status .  For  patients with good performance status  ,  chemoradiation  improves survival compared with  radiotherapy alone  , particularly when the two modalities are administered concurrently .  Sequential chemoradiation  is a treatment option for borderline-status patients  .  Adequate assessment of performance status is important when evaluating treatment options for  patients with unresected non-small cell lung cancer .  Patients and physicians should have a full discussion of the benefits , limitations , and toxicities of therapy."

"7Context : The use of  social marketing  to modify lifestyle choices could be helpful in reducing   youth obesity  .  Some or all of the 8 domains of the National  Social  Marketing Centre ’s  social marketing benchmark  criteria ( SMBC ) are often used but not always defined in intervention studies . Objective : The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of  European school-based interventions  to prevent obesity relative to the inclusion of  SMBC domains  in the intervention . Data Sources : The PubMed , Cochrane , and ERIC data bases were used . Study Selection :  Nonr and omized and r and omized controlled trials conducted from 1990 to April 2014 in participants aged 5 to 17 years were included .  Data Extraction : After the study selection , the 8 domains of the SMBC were assessed in each included study . Results :  Thirty-eight publications were included  in the systematic review . For the meta- analysis , r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) reporting  body mass index  or  prevalence of overweight  and obesity were considered .  Eighteen RCTs with a total of 8681 participants  included at least 5 SMBC . The meta- analysis showed a  small st and ardized mean difference in body mass index  of −0.25 ( 95%CI , −0.45 to −0.04 ) and  a prevalence of overweight and  obesity odds ratio of 0.72 ( 95%CI , 0.5–0.97 ) . Conclusion : Current evidence indicates that the inclusion of at least 5 SMBC domains in school-based interventions could benefit efforts to  prevent obesity in young people .

"%OBJECTIVE To compare the  effectiveness and safety  of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel followed by interval debulking surgery ( NACT-IDS )  to  primary debulking surgery plus postoperative chemotherapy  ( PDS ) for  advanced ovarian cancer .  METHODS A comprehensive systematic review and meta- analysis were conducted by an Expert Panel of the Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology Ovarian Cancer Committee . Multiple public search engines including PubMed / MEDLINE and the Cochrane Data base , were search ed in March 2019 using the entry keywords "" ovarian cancer [ all fields ] "" AND ""  interval debulking surgery  [ all fields ] "" , AND  "" neoadjuvant chemotherapy  [ all fields ] "" . Key inclusion criteria were prospect i ve clinical trials examining  platinum-based NACT   for stage II-IV epithelial ovarian cancer .  The primary outcome of interest was  survival  , and the secondary outcome was  adverse events  with each intervention . RESULTS After screening 333 studies , four phase III r and omized clinical trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria . These trials  included 1692 women ( 847 receiving NACT-IDS and 845 receiving PDS ) .  It was found that  NACT-IDS  and PDS had similar  overall survival  ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 0.97 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.87 - 1.07 , P = 0.53 ) and  progression-free survival  ( HR : 0.98 , 95%CI : 0.90 - 1.08 , P = 0.74 ) . In contrast ,  NACT-IDS  was associated with significantly lower  rates of perioperative complications  ( odds ratio [ OR ] 0.27 , 95%CI : 0.20 - 0.36 , P < 0.001 ) and  perioperative mortality  ( OR : 0.17 , 95%CI : 0.06 - 0.50 , P < 0.001 ) compared to PDS .  This systematic review and meta- analysis suggests that  NACT-IDS with carboplatin and paclitaxel  does not negatively impact the  survival  of  women with advanced ovarian cancer  compared to PDS , while  perioperative complications and mortality  are significantly reduced by 70 - 80 %."
 :  Psychosocial intervention  does not prolong  survival  in cancer . This meta- analysis can not rule out small effect sizes because of the small number of trials and small trial sizes.

"ePersistent  pain  after  breast cancer treatment  is prevalent , and not all patients respond sufficiently to pharmacological treatment . Pain is recognized as a multi-dimensional phenomenon , which includes psychological and social components , and several clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of  psychosocial interventions  on pain in  cancer patients and survivors .  Our aim was to systematic ally review and quantify the existing research on the effect of  psychosocial interventions  on  pain  in  breast cancer patients and survivors .  Two independent raters review ed  474 abstract  s for eligibility , leading to the identification of  26 independent and eligible studies published between 1983 and 2012  , which were assessed for their method ological quality and subjected to meta-analytic evaluation .  A total of 1786 participants were included in the analyses .  A statistically significant and robust  overall effect size  was found across all included studies ( Hedges g = 0.37 , 95 % CI : 0.20–0.40 ; p < 0.001 ) . However , the  effect size  was considerably smaller ( 0.21 ) , when adjusted for possible publication bias . Furthermore , the results were heterogeneous , and when exploring the sources of heterogeneity , studies of higher method ological quality were found to yield a more conservative effect size ( g = 0.21 , 95 % CI : 0.02–0.41 ) than studies of poorer quality ( g = 0.65 , 95 % CI : 0.25–1.04 ) . The results also indicated  that patient educational approaches  yielded a  larger effect size  ( g = 0.64 )  than  relaxation-based  interventions  ( g = 0.31 , 95 % CI : −0.05–0.67 ) and  supportive group therapy  ( g = 0.17 , 95 % CI : 0.02–0.32 ) . Taken together , while  suggestive of psychosocial intervention  as an effective tool in  the management of pain   among breast cancer patients and survivors  , the results should be interpreted as preliminary . The method ological quality of the existing research varied considerably , and only few studies had  selected patients on the basis of the presence  of  pain and included  pain   as the primary outcome."

"  In steroid-naive patients with mild to moderate airway obstruction  , the initiation of  inhaled corticosteroids  in combination with long-acting beta2-agonists does not significantly reduce the  rate of exacerbations  over that achieved with inhaled corticosteroids alone ; it does improve  lung function and symptom-free days  but does not reduce  rescue beta2-agonist use  as compared to inhaled steroids alone . Both options appear safe . There is insufficient evidence at present to recommend use of combination therapy rather than ICS alone as a first-line treatment."
"sOn behalf of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition ( ASPEN ) , a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the best available evidence regarding the validity of relevant body  composition  methods ( eg ,  dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [ DXA ] , ultrasound [ US ]  , and  bioelectrical impedance analysis [ BIA ] )  in  clinical population s.  The guidelines targeted  adults > 18 years of age with a potentially inflammatory condition or pathological end point associated with a specific disease or clinical condition .  In total ,  7375 studies were retrieved  , and  15  DXA  , 7 US , and 23  BIA  studies  provided applicable data . The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the test method against a "" gold st and ard "" reference . The  Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluation criteria  were used to separate the evaluation of the body of evidence from the recommendations . Based on a limited number of studies and expert opinion , DXA is recommended for the assessment of  fat mass  in patients with a variety of disease states ; however , the validity of DXA for  lean mass assessment  in any clinical population remains unknown . No recommendations can be made at this time to support the use of US or BIA in the clinical setting , as data to support its validity in any specific patient population are limited in scope or by the proprietary nature of manufacture-specific BIA regression models to procure body composition data , respectively . Directions for future research are provided . These clinical guidelines were approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors."

"yABSTRACT BACKGROUND  Family and caregiver interventions  typically aim to develop family members ’ coping and caregiving skills and to reduce caregiver burden . We conducted a systematic review of published r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating whether  family-involved interventions  improve patient outcomes  among adults with cancer .  METHODS  RCTs enrolling patients with cancer  were identified by search ing MEDLINE , PsycInfo and other sources through December 2012 .  Studies were limited to subjects over 18 years of age , published in English language , and conducted in the United States .  Patient outcomes included  global quality of life ; physical , general psychological and social functioning ; depression/anxiety ; symptom control and management ; health care utilization ; and relationship adjustment .  RESULTS We identified  27 unique trials  , of which  18  compared a  family intervention to usual care or wait list  ( i.e. , usual  care  with promise of intervention at completion of study period ) and  13  compared  one family intervention to another individual or family intervention ( active control ) .  Compared to usual care , overall strength of evidence for  family interventions  was low . The available data indicated that overall , family-involved interventions did not consistently  improve outcomes of interest  . Similarly , with low or insufficient evidence ,  family-involved interventions  were  not superior  to active controls at  improving cancer patient outcomes  . DISCUSSION Overall , there was low or insufficient evidence that  family and caregiver interventions  were superior to usual or active care . Variability in study population s and interventions made pooling of data problematic and generalizing findings from any single study difficult . Most of the included trials were of poor or fair quality."
" The method ologic limitations of several studies make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the  efficacy  of distant healing . However , given that approximately 57 % of trials showed a positive  treatment effect  , the evidence thus far merits further study."
"dOBJECTIVE The purpose of the present investigation is to conduct a systematic review of the literature to review the clinical results of  platelet rich plasma ( PRP )  and  mesenchymal stem cell treatments ( MSC ) ( biologics )  for  articular cartilage lesions and osteoarthritis of the knee .  METHODS A search of the PubMed , EMBASE , and Cochrane data bases was performed to identify studies involving  biologic therapy  for  osteoarthritis or osteochondral defects .  Only Level I-III clinical trials with at least 3-month follow-up were included . Outcome data was gathered on any  patient-completed surveys , 2nd look arthroscopy , follow-up imaging , biopsy/histology results , and any adverse effects of treatment .  RESULTS  Thirty-three articles met our inclusion criteria .  There was a total of  21  PRP  studies  in the study . All  PRP  studies showed clinical improvement with  PRP therapies  in outcomes surveys  measuring patient satisfaction , pain , and function .  Two studies reported no significant difference in improvement compared to  hyaluronic acid ( HA ) .  Similarly , the 7/9 MSC studies showed improvement . One study found  BM-MSC implantation  was not significantly superior to  matrix assisted  chondrocyte  implantation  ( MACI ) , while one reported peripheral blood stem cells ( PBSC ) did not significantly improve outcomes over  HA .  Of the three studies looking at a combination of  MSC/PRP  , two found  MSC/PRP  combination did not improve outcomes compared to  MSC  or  PRP therapy  alone . The one  PRP  study that had a 2nd look arthroscopy reported increases  cartilage regeneration  with  PRP .  All 8 MSC studies with follow-up MRI and all 7 MSC studies with 2nd look arthroscopy showed improvement in  cartilage regeneration  in terms  of coverage , fill of the defect , and /or firmness of the new cartilage .   Current data suggests that , of the two treatments , MSC provides more significant disease modifying effect ; however , further research needs to be done to compare these two treatments and determine if there is a synergetic effect when combined."
"sIntroduction .  Elderly patients  are underrepresented from a majority of clinical trials and the choice of the best treatment becomes a challenge . The optimal treatment should be personalized and based on a multidisciplinary approach that includes radiation oncologists , surgeons , geriatricians , medical oncologists , social workers , and support services . The global evaluation of the patients and the creation of nomograms may facilitate the definition of long-term treatment benefits minimizing the use of unnecessary therapy . Material and Method . A systematic research using PubMed , Scopus , and Cochrane library was performed to identify full articles analyzing the  efficacy  of  APBI  in  elderly patients with breast cancer .  Clinical Trials.gov was search ed for ongoing or recently completed trials , and PROSPERO was search ed for ongoing or recently completed systematic review s. Results Seven papers fulfilled the eligibility criteria . The  number of evaluated patients was 405 and the median age was 77.7 years .  The  disease-free survival ( DFS ) range  was 96.1%-100 % , the  grade 3 - 4 toxicity range  was 0%-6.6 % , the  cancer-specific survival ( CSS )  range was 97.9%-100 % , and the  overall survival ( OS )  range was 87%-100 % . All studies reported  excellent/good cosmetic results  in a range of 74 % to 99 % . Conclusion  Accelerated partial breast irradiation ( APBI )  results in a  safe and effective  substitute for the  adjuvant external beam radiotherapy  in  selected elderly early-stage breast cancer patients .  Based on the relatively low toxicity ,  APBI  should be advised in selected patients with life expectancies larger than 5 - 10 years."

"eINTRODUCTION The optimal treatment for  peritoneal carcinomatosis ( PC ) of colorectal origin  is a combination of  cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( CRS + IPC ) .  Although 5-year survival rates of up to 40 % have been reported , recurrent disease remains common and is estimated to be a strong negative prognostic factor for survival . This systematic review elaborates on the incidence of recurrent disease and the possibilities to prevent and treat recurrence . METHODS Two search es were performed . To identify the magnitude of recurrent the disease , a search was performed in Pubmed and EMBASE until September 2014 . A second search was performed in Pubmed to identify treatment of recurrent disease with  secondary CRS + IPC .  RESULTS The first search result ed in  139 and 94 articles in Pubmed and EMBASE respectively . Among those , 28 were included .   Overall recurrence rates  ranged from 22.5 to 82 % .  Local , systemic and combined local-systemic recurrence  ranged from 6 to 42.5 % , 10.4 - 43 % and 5.8 - 21.5 % .  Median time to recurrence  varied from 9 to 23 months ,  three-year disease free survival  ranged from 14 to 41.5 % . The second search result ed in  140 articles among which 17 met the inclusion criteria . A total of 190 patients underwent  secondary CRS .    Median survival  after the second procedure ranged from 18 to 55.7 months . One , two and  three-year survival  ranged between 66 and 94 , 44 - 50 and 0 - 66 % .  Recurrence is very common after  cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy  for  PC of colorectal origin  . Repeat  cytoreductive surgery  suggests a potential survival benefit for a highly selected group . Therefore , strategies to prevent recurrence are of the utmost importance."
" This review supports the premise that one HPV vaccine dose may be as effective in preventing HPV infection as multi-dose schedules in  healthy young women .  However , it also highlights the paucity of available evidence from purpose - design ed , prospect ively-r and omised trials . Results from ongoing clinical trials assessing the efficacy and immunogenicity of  single-dose HPV vaccination  compared to currently-recommended schedules are awaited."
" AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATION S  Adherence  could be improved through  interventions focused on medical management  , provided individually in a clinical or home setting by a mono-disciplinary team .  Interventions  focused on dealing with a chronic condition might be provided individually , through  telemedicine programs facilitating peer-support .  These intervention elements seemed effective irrespective of diagnosis , and may therefore act as good starting points for further research into and for improvement of  self-management support  for  youth with chronic conditions in pediatric care .  Results underlined the need to systematic ally develop and evaluate   self-management  interventions  , since this may provide more evidence for effectiveness and effective intervention components."
"  Routine oral or enteral supplementation  seems to improve the  nutritional indices  of  adult patients  , but there are insufficient data in trials which meet strict method ological criteria to be certain if  mortality  is reduced . Benefits were not restricted to particular patient groups . Further large pragmatic r and omised controlled trials of  routine  nutritional supplementation are justified."
"sOBJECTIVES It was estimated that approximately 60 % of the world 's population is classified as inactive or insufficiently active . This meta- analysis investigated the effect of  web-based interventions  on different types  of  physical activity ( PA )   measurements in general population and potential moderating variables . STUDY DESIGN PubMed , CINAHL , EBSCOhost , PsycINFO , Scopus , Ovid , and ScienceDirect literature search es were conducted to identify studies investigating the effect of  web-based interventions on PA .  METHODS R and omized controlled trials on  PA  changes reported in moderate to vigorous intensity , walking , and step count in the intervention group in comparison with the control group were pooled with a fixed-effects model separately . RESULTS A  total of 22 studies comprising 16,476 and 14,475 subjects in intervention and control groups respectively were included .   Web-based interventions  had positive and significant effect on  increasing PA .  Of 14 trials reporting  moderate to vigorous physical activity ( MVPA )  , five showed a significant increase in  the MVPA level  after the intervention . There was significant heterogeneity between studies ( P < 0.001 and I2 = 67.8 % ) . Of six trials that reported the  number of steps by  using the  pedometer  , three showed a significant increase for the  step counts  in intervention groups ( P < 0.001 and I2 = 93.3 % ) , of 14 trials assessed  PA level  by reporting walking  minutes per  week , four studies showed a significant increase in  walking minutes .  There was significant heterogeneity between studies ( P < 0.001 , I2 = 68.1 % ) . Overall , the effect of  web-based interventions  seemed to be influenced by the characteristics of mean age of participants , trial duration , and study quality ( P < 0.05 ) .  The  web-based PA interventions  had a positive significant effect on increasing all the three  types of PA  among the  general population  . However , the effects appear to depend on the design of the study , age , and duration of studies."
"sTo date , topical therapies guarantee a better delivery of high concentrations of pharmacologic agents to the soft periodontal tissue , gingiva , and periodontal ligament as well as to the hard tissue such as alveolar bone and cementum .  Topical hyaluronic acid ( HA )  has recently been recognized as an adjuvant treatment for  chronic inflammatory disease  in addition to its use to improve healing after dental procedures . The aim of our work was to systematic ally review the published literature about potential effects of  HA  as an adjuvant treatment for  chronic inflammatory disease  , in addition to its use to improve healing after common dental procedures . Relevant published studies were found in PubMed , Google Scholar , and Ovid using a combined keyword search or medical subject headings . At the end of our study selection process ,  25 relevant publications  were included ,  three of them regarding gingivitis , 13 of them relating to chronic periodontitis , seven of them relating to dental surgery , including implant and sinus lift procedures  , and the  remaining three articles describing oral ulcers .  Not only does topical administration of  HA  play a pivotal key role in the postoperative care of patients undergoing dental procedures , but positive results were also generally observed in all  patients with chronic inflammatory gingival and periodontal disease  and in patients with oral ulcers."
"eSubstance  abuse in young adults  is a public health issue with costs to the individual and society . There is mounting evidence that the increased uses of  mHealth  approaches have promise as a way to facilitate reductions in substance use . This systematic review evaluated the recent body of research on  mHealth-based interventions  for substance use , with aims of ( a ) examining the functionality and effectiveness of these interventions , ( b ) evaluating the available research on the effectiveness of these interventions for substance use , and ( c ) evaluating the design , methodology , results , theoretical grounding , limitations , and implication s of each study . We identified eligible  studies  by search  ing electronic data bases using Boolean methods  . The review ed  studies ( N = 12 )  indicated that that a wide range of  Internet-based , text messaging , and smartphone application interventions  have been developed to address substance use . Interventions had an assortment of features ; participants in each study highlighted the  ease and convenience of  the interventions ; and the majority of studies provided support for the  efficacy  of mHealth in reducing substance use . Mobile technology is a promising tool for reducing substance use and warrants further development . Future practice including the use of  mHealth interventions  can be an integral part of reducing substance use."
" The results of this review indicate that no substantive meaningful benefits are associated with  social norms interventions  for prevention of  alcohol misuse among college/university students .  Although some significant effects were found , we interpret the effect sizes as too small , given the measurement scales used in the studies included in this review , to be of relevance for policy or practice . Moreover , the significant effects are not consistent for all misuse measures , heterogeneity was a problem in some analyses and bias can not be discounted as a potential cause of these findings."

"dBACKGROUND : In high‐income countries , a healthy diet is widely accessible . However , a change toward a poor‐ quality diet with a low nutritional value in high‐income countries has led to an inadequate vitamin intake during pregnancy . OBJECTIVE : We conducted a systematic review and meta‐ analysis to evaluate the association between  multivitamin  use  among women in high‐income countries and the risk   of  adverse birth outcomes (  preterm birth [ primary outcome ] , low birthweight , small for gestational age , stillbirth , neonatal death , perinatal mortality , and congenital anomalies  without further specification  )  . STUDY DESIGN : We search ed electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , Embase , Cochrane , Scopus , and CINAHL ) from inception to June 17 , 2016 , using synonyms of pregnancy , study /trial type , and  multivitamins  .  Eligible studies were all studies in high‐income countries investigating the association between  multivitamin  use  ( 3 or more vitamins or minerals  in  tablets  or   capsules   )   and adverse birth outcomes .  We evaluated r and omized , controlled trials using the Cochrane Collaboration tool . Observational studies were evaluated using the  Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale  . Meta‐analyses were applied on raw data for outcomes with data for at least 2 studies and were conducted using RevMan ( version 5.3 ) . Outcomes were pooled using the r and om‐effect model . The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grade s of Research , Assessment , Development and Evaluation approach . RESULTS :  We identified 35 eligible studies including 98,926 women .  None of the studies compared the use of folic acid and iron vs the use of  multivitamins  . The use  of multivitamin  did not  change the  risk of  the primary outcome , preterm birth  ( relative risk , 0.84 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.69–1.03 ] ) .  However , the risk of small for gestational age  ( relative risk , 0.77 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.63–0.93 ]  ) , neural tube defects  ( relative risk , 0.67 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.52–0.87  ] ) , cardiovascular defects  ( relative risk , 0.83 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.70–0.98  ] ) , urine tract defects  ( relative risk , 0.60 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.46–0.78 ]  ) , and limb deficiencies  ( relative risk , 0.68 [ 95 % confidence interval , 0.52‐0.89 ] ) was decreased . Of the 35 identified studies , only 4 were r and omized , controlled trials .  The degree of clinical evidence according to the Grade s of Research , Assessment , Development , and Evaluation system  was low or very low for all outcomes except  for recurrence of neural tube defects  in which a moderate degree of clinical evidence was found .  : Routine multivitamin use in high‐income countries can be recommended but with caution because of the low quality of evidence . R and omized , controlled trials or well‐performed , large prospect i ve cohort studies are needed."
"tBackground Peritoneal cytology has been used as a part of the cancer  staging of gastric cancer patients .  The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the value of peritoneal cytology as part of the staging of gastric cancer and survival prediction . The second aim was to establish if positive cytology may be modified by  neoadjuvant therapy  , to improve prognosis . Methods An electronic literature search was performed using Embase , Medline , Web of Science , and Cochrane library data bases up to January 2016 . The logarithm of the hazard ratio ( HR ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) was used as the primary summary statistic . Comparative studies were used , and the outcome measure was  survival  in three groups : ( 1 ) positive versus negative cytology at staging laparoscopy immediately preceding surgery ; ( 2 ) effect of  neoadjuvant therapy  on  cytology  and  survival  ; and ( 3 ) positive cytology in the absence of macroscopic peritoneal disease was compared with obvious macroscopic peritoneal disease . Results Pooled analysis demonstrated that positive cytology was associated with significantly  reduced overall survival  ( HR , 3.46 ; 95 % CI , 2.77–4.31 ; P < 0.0001 ) . Interestingly , negative cytology following  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  was associated with significantly  improved overall survival  ( HR , 0.42 ; 95 % CI , 0.31–0.57 ; P < 0.0001 ) . The absence of macroscopic peritoneal disease with positive cytology was associated with significantly  improved overall survival  ( HR , 0.64 ; 95 % CI , 0.56–0.73 ; P < 0.0001 ) . Conclusion This study suggests that  patients with initial positive cytology  may have a good prognosis following  neoadjuvant treatment  if the cytology results change to negative after treatment."

"eAgeing often causes a reduction in  appetite and energy intake  in  older adults  which can result in malnutrition . Current guidelines for  older adults  suggest increasing physical activity to enhance appetite  .  However , it is unclear if there is evidence to support this advice . This aim of this review is to assess if  appetite and energy intake  is changed in  older adults that undertake  acute or regular physical activity   ( measured from cross sectional and intervention studies )  .  Data bases SPORTD iscus , CINAHL , MEDLINE were search ed for  studies between 1970 and 2017  using search terms related to ageing ,  physical activity ( including exercise )  , energy and appetite .  Studies included contained adults over 60 years , including acute , cross-sectional and intervention ( longitudinal ) studies . Of 34 full-text articles assessed , 8 were included .  The Cochrane Collaboration 's tool was used for assessing risk of bias . No acute studies were found . Of the cross-sectional studies , one study suggested that individuals who undertake habitual physical activity had an increased  energy intake  and none of the studies found differences in  appetite ratings . Energy intakes  increased in the intervention studies , though not always sufficiently to maintain energy balance . One study showed that ability to correctly  compensate for previous energy intake  was better in those that undertake habitual physical activity . The limited number of studies , wide range of data collection method ologies , time-scales and interventions mean that definitive outcomes are difficult to identify . At this stage advice to  increase acute or habitual physical activity  as a mean to increase  appetite  is not supported by sufficient evidence."
 Exercise  during chemotherapy is safe and should be encouraged because of beneficial effects on  QoL and physical functioning  . More research is required to determine the impact on chemotherapy completion rates and prognosis.
"ePurpose of review Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in  children and adults  in  developed countries  around the world . Despite international treatment guidelines , poor asthma control remains a frequent problem leading to missed school and work , and emergency room visits and hospitalizations . Many  patients with asthma  report exercise as a trigger for their asthma , which likely leads to exercise avoidance as a means to control symptoms . Evolving research has suggested that  routine exercise  may actually help improve some aspects of  asthma  control  .  This review discusses the recent research addressing how  routine exercise  affects important asthma-related outcomes including  symptoms , lung function and quality of life .  Recent findings Several systematic review s and meta-analyses have been conducted in recent years , which strongly support the safety of  routine exercise  in  children and adults with asthma .   Exercise  appears to favor improvements in  aerobic fitness , asthma symptoms and quality of life  , but results so far are less consistent in demonstrating improvements to  lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness .  Summary In addition to routine management guidelines , clinicians should recommend for their  patients with asthma   routine exercise  for its general health benefits and likely improvement in asthma symptoms and quality of life."
"sABSTRACT Objectives : To up date previous review s and provide a more detailed overview of the  effectiveness , acceptability  and  conceptual basis  of  communication training- interventions  for  carers of people living with dementia .  Method : We search ed CINAHL Plus , MEDLINE and PsycINFO using a specific search and extraction protocol , and PRISMA guidelines . Two authors conducted search es and extracted studies that reported  effectiveness , efficacy or acceptability data  regarding a  communication training-intervention  for  carers of people living with dementia .  Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines .  Quality of qualitative studies  was also systematic ally assessed . Results : Search es identified  450 studies ( after de-duplication )  .  Thirty-eight studies were identified for inclusion in the review .  Twenty-two  studies  focused on  professional carers ; 16 studies focused mainly on family carers .   Training- interventions  were found to improve  communication and knowledge .  Overall  training-  interventions were not found to significantly improve  behaviour that challenges and caregiver burden . Acceptability levels  were high overall , but  satisfaction ratings  were found to be higher for family carers than professional carers . Although many interventions were not supported by a clear conceptual framework , person-centred care was the most common framework described . Conclusion : This review indicated that  training- interventions  were effective in  improving carer knowledge and communication skills .  Effective interventions involved active participation by carers and were generally skills based ( including practicing skills and discussion ) . However , improvements to  quality of life and psychological wellbeing  of  carers and people living with dementia  may require more targeted interventions."

"sA  nutritional approach  could be a promising strategy to prevent or slow the progression of   neurodegenerative  diseases  such as  Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s disease  , since there is no effective therapy for these diseases so far . The beneficial effects of  omega-3 fatty acids  are now well established by a plethora of studies through their involvement in multiple biochemical functions , including synthesis of  anti-inflammatory mediators  ,  cell membrane fluidity , intracellular signaling  , and  gene expression .  This systematic review will consider epidemiological studies and clinical trials that assessed the impact of supplementation or  dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  on  neurodegenerative  diseases such as Parkinson ’s and Alzheimer ’s diseases . Indeed , treatment with  omega-3 fatty acids  , being safe and well tolerated , represents a valuable and biologically plausible tool in the management of neurodegenerative diseases in their early stages."
" Overall , combination inhaled therapy  with  SAAC  and  SABA  reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function  in  adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma .  In particular , combination inhaled therapy was more effective in  preventing hospitalisation  in adults with severe asthma exacerbations who are at increased risk of hospitalisation , compared to those with mild-moderate exacerbations , who were at a lower risk to be hospitalised . A single dose of combination therapy and multiple doses both showed  reductions in the risk of hospitalisation  among  adults with acute asthma  . However , adults receiving combination therapy were more likely to  experience adverse events  ,  such as tremor , agitation , and palpitations  , compared to patients  receiving  SABA  alone ."
"dPURPOSE OF REVIEW The use of  insulin sensitizing drugs  such as  metformin  in  polycystic ovary syndrome  has been increasingly popular and vali date d by systematic review s. There has also been an interest in the use of  metformin  for gestational  diabetes .  However , administration of  metformin  to prevent miscarriage is controversial and widespread use of this drug in early pregnancy requires investigation . RECENT FINDINGS There are cl aims that  miscarriage and gestational diabetes  are more common in polycystic ovary syndrome and that use of insulin sensitizers improves outcomes dramatically . This review suggests there is no evidence for increased risk of  miscarriage  solely due to polycystic ovary syndrome and that there are insufficient data for promoting therapy with  metformin .  There is some reason for use of  metformin  in mid-pregnancy for gestational diabetes but better evidence from r and omized controlled trials is urgently needed . SUMMARY The use of  metformin  in  early pregnancy  for reducing the  risk of  miscarriage   should be avoided outside of the context of properly design ed prospect i ve r and omized trials .  Safety in  early  pregnancy  appears to be reassuring but not completely proven . The use of  metformin  in mid-pregnancy for  gestational diabetes  appears more logical but also needs adequate trials before general use is advocated."

"0Aim or objective To evaluate the effectiveness of  behavioural interventions  that report  sedentary behaviour  outcomes during  early childhood .  Design Systematic review and meta- analysis . Data sources Academic Search Complete , CINAHL Complete , Global Health , MEDLINE Complete , PsycINFO , SPORTD iscus with Full Text and EMBASE electronic data bases were search ed in March 2016 . Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Inclusion criteria were :  ( 1 ) published in a peer- review ed English language journal ; ( 2 ) sedentary behaviour outcomes reported ; ( 3 ) r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) study design ; and ( 4 ) participants were children with a mean age of ⩽5.9 years and not yet attending primary /elementary school at postintervention .  Results  31 studies were included in the systematic review  and  17 studies  in the meta-  analysis  .  The overall mean difference in screen time  outcomes between groups was −17.12 ( 95 % CI −28.82 to −5.42 ) min/day with a significant overall intervention effect ( Z=2.87 , p=0.004 ) .  The overall mean difference in sedentary time  between groups was −18.91 ( 95 % CI −33.31 to −4.51 ) min/day with a significant overall intervention effect ( Z=2.57 , p=0.01 ) . Subgroup analyses suggest that  for screen time  , interventions of ≥6 months duration and those conducted in a community-based setting are  most effective  .  For sedentary time   , interventions targeting physical activity ( and reporting changes in sedentary time  ) are more effective than  those directly targeting  sedentary time . Summary / conclusions Despite heterogeneity in study methods and results , overall interventions to reduce  sedentary behaviour  in  early  childhood show significant reductions , suggesting that this may be an opportune time to intervene .

"3Objectives To report on  women ’s and families  ’ expectations and experiences of  hospital  postnatal  care  , and also to reflect on  women  ’s satisfaction with  hospital postnatal care  and to relate their expectations to their actual care experiences . Design Systematic review . Setting  UK .  Participants  Postnatal women .  Primary and secondary outcomes  Women ’s and families ’  expectations , experiences and satisfaction with hospital  postnatal care .  Methods Embase , MEDLINE , PsycINFO , Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstract s , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health ( CINAHL Plus ) , Science Citation Index , and Social Sciences Citation Index were search ed to identify relevant studies published since 1970 . We incorporated findings from qualitative , quantitative and mixed- methods studies . Eligible studies were independently screened and quality -assessed using a modified version of the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for quantitative studies and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies  .  Data were extracted on participants ’ characteristics , study period , setting , study objective and study specified outcomes , in addition to the summary of results . Results Data were included from  53 studies  , of which 28  were  quantitative , 19  were  qualitative and  6  were mixed- methods studies . The method  ological  quality of the included studies was mixed , and only three were completely free from bias . Women were generally  satisfied  with their  hospital postnatal care  but were critical of  staff interaction  , the  ward environment  and  infant feeding support .   Ethnic minority women  were more critical of hospital postnatal care than  white women .  Although  duration of postnatal stay  has declined over time , women were generally happy with this aspect of their care . There was limited evidence regarding women ’s  expectations of  postnatal care , families ’ experience and social disadvantage . Conclusion  Women  were generally positive about their experiences of hospital postnatal care , but improvements could still be made . Individualised , flexible models of postnatal care should be evaluated and implemented . PROSPERO registration number CRD42017057913."

"eWe performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to examine factors associated with  HBV immune response in dialysis patients  , and the association between the immune response to the  HBV vaccine  and mortality . Electronic data bases were search ed for studies of  dialysis patients  that compared the characteristics of  HBV vaccine  responders and non-responders . Mortality was also analyzed according to the vaccine immune response ( defined by hepatitis B surface antibody titer > 10 mIU/mL ) . R and om-effects model meta-analyses were performed to compute a weighted mean difference ( WMD ) , a pooled odds ratio ( OR ) , and a pooled risk ratio ( RR ) between groups . We identified  61 studies with a total of 6628 dialysis patients who completed the course of  HBV vaccination  , 4582 responders ( 69 % ) and 2046 non-responders ( 31 % ) .  By meta- analysis , relative to non-responders , HBV vaccine responders had a  higher dialysis adequacy  as measured by Kt/V ( WMD 0.08 , P < 0.001 ) , a  higher serum albumin  ( WMD 0.12 gm/dL , P < 0.001 ) , a  higher normalized protein catabolic rate  ( WMD 0.12 gm/kg/day , P = 0.001 ) , a higher  hemoglobin  ( WMD 0.15 gm/L , P = 0.03 ) , and a  higher parathyroid hormone level  ( WMD 44 pg/mL , P = 0.004 ) .  HBV vaccine  responders were younger ( WMD − 4.68 years , P < 0.001 ) , had been on dialysis for longer ( WMD 2.60 months , P < 0.001 ) , were less likely to have  diabetes  mellitus ( pooled OR 0.65 , P < 0.001 ) , and were less likely to carry the  human leukocyte antigen  (  HLA  )  DR3  ( pooled OR 0.38 , P = 0.01 ) . Compared to non-responders , HBV vaccine responders had  lower risk for all-cause mortality  ( pooled RR 0.64 , P < 0.001 ) ,  and lower risk for cardiovascular-related mortality  ( pooled RR 0.74 , P = 0.02 ) .  In dialysis patients  , the lack  of immune response to the HBV vaccine  is associated with older age , diabetes mellitus , HLA-DR3 status , shorter time on  dialysis  ,  lower nutritional status  ,  lower hemoglobin  ,  lower PTH level  , and  lower dialysis adequacy  . Tackling some of these modifiable factors might improve the HBV vaccine immune response."
"tParkinson ’s disease ( PD ) represents the second most common neurodegenerative disease . Currently ,  conventional physical therapy  is complemented by  additional physical interventions  with  recreational  components , improving different motor conditions in  people with PD .  This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of additional  physical interventions to conventional physical therapy  in  Parkinson ’s disease .  A systematic review and meta- analysis of r  and omized  controlled trials were performed . The literature search was conducted in PubMed , Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) , Scopus , SciELO and Web of Science . The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the method ological quality of the studies . A total of  11 r and omized controlled trials were included in this review  . Five of them contributed information to the meta- analysis . The statistical analysis showed  favorable results   for dance-based  therapy  in motor balance : ( Timed Up and Go : st and ardized mean difference (  SMD  )  = −1.16 ;  95 % Confidence Interval (CI):(−2.30 to −0.03 ) ; Berg Balance Scale :  SMD = 4.05 ; 95%CI:(1.34 to 6.75 ) ) . Aquatic interventions  showed favorable results in balance confidence ( Activities-Specific Balance Confidence  : SMD=10.10 ; 95%CI:(2.27 to 17.93 ) ) . The results obtained in this review highlight the potential benefit  of dance-based therapy  in  functional  balance for  people with Parkinson ’s disease  , recommending its incorporation in clinical practice .

A systematic literature search was undertaken on Medline ( EBSCOhost ) , PsycInfo , CINAHL , and Scopus data bases and via manual search ing . Inclusion criteria were experimental or quasiexperimental design s targeting  fathers from LMIC  , which measured either  breastfeeding initiation , breastfeeding exclusivity , or duration of breastfeeding  as the main outcomes . No time restriction was put in place , and all articles were published in English . The quality of selected papers was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool . A total of  8 articles  were included from 6 interventions : 2 quasiexperimental and 4 r and omized control trials . All interventions involved  breastfeeding education   targeting fathers  ; 2 were given only to  fathers  , and 4 delivered to  both fathers and mothers  . Among these interventions , 2 measured both  early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding ;  one  exclusive breastfeeding only ;  one  exclusive breastfeeding , knowledge , and attitudes ;  one  exclusive breastfeeding and knowledge ;  and one  breastfeeding , continued breastfeeding , and awareness .  Across all interventions , breastfeeding education showed significant improvement in  breastfeeding outcomes  in the intervention compared with the control groups . In summary ,  breastfeeding education interventions  targeting  fathers in LMIC  are effective in improving  early initiation of breastfeeding , exclusive breastfeeding , and continued breastfeeding .  Thus , breastfeeding promotion should consider the education and involvement of fathers in the intervention."
"sRisky behaviors are a leading cause of preventable  morbidity  and  mortality  , yet  behavioral counseling interventions  to address them are underutilized in healthcare setting s. Research on such interventions has grown steadily , but the systematic review of this research is complicated by wide variations in the organization , content , and delivery of behavioral interventions and the lack of a consistent language and framework to describe these differences . The Counseling and  Behavioral Interventions   Work Group of the United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF )  was convened to address adapting existing USPSTF methods to issues and challenges raised by  behavioral counseling  intervention topical review s. The systematic review of  behavioral counseling interventions  seeks to establish whether such interventions addressing individual behaviors improve  health outcomes .  Few studies directly address this question , so evidence addressing whether changing individual behavior improves  health outcomes  and whether  behavioral counseling  interventions in clinical setting s help people change those behaviors must be linked . To illustrate this process , we present two separate analytic frameworks derived from screening topic tools that we developed to guide USPSTF behavioral topic review s. No simple empirically vali date d model captures the broad range of intervention components across risk behaviors , but the Five A 's construct-assess , advise , agree , assist , and arrange-adapted from tobacco cessation interventions in clinical care provides a workable framework to report  behavioral counseling intervention  review findings . We illustrate the use of this framework with general findings from recent  behavioral counseling  intervention studies . Readers are referred to the USPSTF ( www.ahrq.gov/clinic/prevenix.htm or 1 - 800 - 358 - 9295 ) for systematic evidence review s and USPSTF recommendations based on these review s for specific behaviors."

"aPURPOSE OF REVIEW The role of  theophylline  in the management of  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  remains controversial . This review was undertaken to determine the efficacy of theophylline in  patients with stable disease .  RECENT FINDINGS  Twenty-two good quality r and omized controlled trials  were included in this systematic review . The review showed that  theophylline  significantly improved  forced expiratory volume in 1 s  and  forced vital capacity  ( weighted mean difference 0.10 L ; 95 % confidence interval 0.04 - 0.16 and weighted mean difference 0.21 L ; 95 % confidence interval 0.10 - 0.31 , respectively ) .  V  also improved with theophylline ( weighted mean difference 195.27 mL/min ; 95 % confidence interval 112.71 - 277.83 ) , as did  Pa  and  Pa  ( weighted mean difference 1.45 mmHg ; 95 % confidence interval 0.26 - 2.65 and weighted mean difference -1.09 mmHg ; 95 % confidence interval -1.83 to -0.35 , respectively ) . Patients preferred  theophylline  over  placebo  ( relative risk 2.27 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.26 - 4.11 ) .  Theophylline  increased the  risk of nausea  , however , compared with  placebo  ( relative risk 7.67 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.47 - 39.94 ) . SUMMARY This review has shown that oral  theophylline  plays an important role in the management of  patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  by improving  lung function , arterial blood gas tensions and ventilatory capacity .  Patients also preferred treatment with  theophylline  when compared with  placebo .  The benefits of  theophylline  in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , however , have to be weighed against the risk of adverse  effects  , particularly nausea."
"hObjectives Since the peptidyl arginine deiminase of Porphyromonas gingivalis is able to citrullinate peptides and proteins , various studies have suggested the species as a possible link between periodontal disease ( PD ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . This systematic review including meta- analysis was aim ed to evaluate whether differences in terms of  antibody titers  against P. gingivalis exist between  RA patients and systemically healthy individuals with and without PD .  Material s and methods The following focused question was addressed : Are the  antibody titers  against  P. gingivalis  of  RA patients  different from systemically healthy individuals with and without PD ? A systematic data search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE . The collected data underwent a meta- analysis to detect statistically significant differences in terms of  antibody levels  between the groups . Results From  114 articles found by the search 13 articles  met the inclusion criteria and provided data suitable for meta- analysis . After analyzing various levels of confinement the meta- analysis revealed a statistically significant higher  antibody titer against P. gingivalis  in  patients suffering  from  RA  in comparison with systemically and periodontally healthy controls ( p < 0.01 ) and systemically healthy patients with PD ( p < 0.01 ) . Conclusion The present findings indicate that RA is often accompanied by the presence of an  immune response  against P. gingivalis . Clinical relevance The significantly higher  antibody response  to P. gingivalis in comparison to systemically healthy individuals supports the link between PD and RA by P. gingivalis . Screening of the regularly taken blood sample s of  RA patients  for P. gingivalis antibodies may help to sensitize rheumatologists and RA patients for improving periodontal health."
"yPatient  navigation  has been proposed to combat cancer disparities in  vulnerable population s. Vulnerable population s  often have poorer cancer outcomes and lower levels of screening , adherence , and treatment .  Navigation  has been studied in various cancers , but few studies have assessed navigation in lung cancer . Additionally , there is a lack of consistency in metrics to assess the quality of navigation programs . The authors conducted a systematic review of published cancer screening studies to identify quality metrics used in navigation programs , as well as to recommend st and ardized metrics to define excellence in lung cancer navigation . The authors included  26 studies evaluating navigation metrics in breast , cervical , colorectal , prostate , and lung cancer .  After review ing the literature , the authors propose the following navigation metrics for lung cancer screening programs : ( 1 ) screening rate , ( 2 ) compliance with follow-up , ( 3 ) time to treatment initiation , ( 4 ) patient satisfaction , ( 5 ) quality of life , ( 6 ) biopsy complications , and ( 7 ) cultural competency."

" Despite a host of additional needs experienced by  women with cervical cancer  , a predominant focus on sexuality/intimacy and information seeking issues is noted . Study limitations preclude drawing conclusions as to how these needs evolve over time from diagnosis to treatment and subsequently to survivorship . Whether demographic or clinical variables such as age , race/ethnicity , disease stage or treatment modality play a moderating role , only remains to be answered in future studies."
" More intense combination chemotherapy significantly improves the  disease-free survival  and the data indicate a modest improvement in  OS .  The addition of  anthracyclines  ( e.g.  doxorubicin )  or the  taxanes  [ e.g.  paclitaxel ( Taxol ) ]  to  cisplatin  increases the  response rate .  More intensive regimens are associated with the gain in  survival .  However ,  grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity  are also increased . Future developments are likely to exploit specific molecular characteristics of endometrial cancers , including their hormone dependence , growth factor target overexpression and PTEN loss . While no one drug or regimen offers a clear benefit for  women with advanced endometrial cancer  ,  platinum drugs  ,  anthracyclines  and  paclitaxel  seem the most promising agents . Future trials should address the impact of such agents on  QoL and symptom control  in addition to survival .  Chemotherapy  and  endocrine therapy  need to be compared directly in an RCT."
"SOBJECTIVE To determine clinical and physiological effects of  high frequency oscillation  compared with  conventional ventilation  in  patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) .  DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis . DATA SOURCES Electronic data bases to March 2010 , conference proceedings , bibliographies , and primary investigators . STUDY SELECTION R and omised controlled trials of  high frequency oscillation  compared with  conventional ventilation  in  adults or children with acute lung injury/ARDS .  Data selection Three authors independently extracted data on  clinical , physiological , and safety outcomes  according to a predefined protocol . We contacted investigators of all included studies to clarify methods and obtain additional data . Analyses used r and om effects models . RESULTS  Eight r and omised controlled trials ( n=419 patients ) were included ; almost all patients had ARDS .  Method ological quality was good . The  ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen  at 24 , 48 , and 72 hours was 16 - 24 % higher in patients receiving  high frequency oscillation  . There were no significant differences in  oxygenation index  because  mean airway pressure  rose by 22 - 33 % in patients receiving high frequency oscillation ( P</=0.01 ) . In patients r and omised to high frequency oscillation ,  mortality  was significantly reduced ( risk ratio 0.77 , 95 % confidence interval 0.61 to 0.98 , P=0.03 ; six trials , 365 patients , 160  deaths  ) , and  treatment failure ( refractory hypoxaemia , hypercapnoea , hypotension , or barotrauma )  result ing in discontinuation of assigned therapy was less likely ( 0.67 , 0.46 to 0.99 , P=0.04 ; five trials , 337 patients , 73 events ) . Other risks were similar . There was substantial heterogeneity between trials for physiological ( I(2)=21 - 95 % ) but not clinical ( I(2)=0 % ) outcomes . Pooled results were based on few events for most clinical outcomes .   High frequency oscillation  might improve  survival  and is unlikely to cause harm . As ongoing large multicentre trials will not be completed for several years , these data help clinicians who currently use or are considering this technique for patients with ARDS."

 Findings confirm that information needs to be relevant and comprehensive to enable parents to manage an episode of minor illness . Incomplete information leaves parents still needing to seek help and irrelevant information appears to reduce parents '  trust  in the intervention . Interventions are more likely to be effective if they are also delivered in non-stressful environments such as the home and are coproduced with parents.
"nBACKGROUND Rates of imaging for  low-back pain  are high and are associated with increased health care costs and radiation exposure as well as potentially poorer patient outcomes . We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of interventions aim ed at reducing the use of  imaging  for low-back pain . METHODS We search ed  MEDLINE , Embase , CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest records to June 23 , 2014 .  We included r and omized controlled trials , controlled clinical trials and interrupted time series studies that assessed interventions design ed to reduce the use of  imaging  in any clinical setting , including primary , emergency and specialist care . Two independent review ers extracted data and assessed risk of bias . We used raw data on  imaging rates  to calculate summary statistics . Study heterogeneity prevented meta- analysis . RESULTS  A total of 8500 records were identified  through the literature  search .  Of the  54 potentially eligible studies review ed in full , 7 were included in our review .  Clinical decision support involving a modified referral form in a hospital setting  reduced imaging  by 36.8 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 33.2 % to 40.5 % ) . Targeted reminders to primary care physicians of appropriate indications for imaging reduced  referrals for imaging  by 22.5 % ( 95 % CI 8.4 % to 36.8 % ) . Interventions that  used practitioner audits and feedback , practitioner education or guideline dissemination  did not significantly reduce  imaging rates .  Lack of power within some of the included studies result ed in lack of statistical significance despite potentially clinical ly important effects . INTERPRETATION Clinical decision support in a hospital setting and targeted reminders to primary care doctors were effective interventions in reducing the  use of imaging  for low-back pain . These are potentially low-cost interventions that would substantially decrease medical expenditures associated with the management of low-back pain."

">The administration of an appropriate  volume of intravenous fluids  , while avoiding fluid overload , is a major challenge in the pediatric intensive care unit . Despite our efforts , fluid overload is a very common clinical observation in  critically ill children , in particular in those with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome ( PARDS ) . Patients with ARDS  have widespread damage of the alveolar-capillary barrier , potentially making them vulnerable to fluid overload with the development of pulmonary edema leading to prolonged course of disease . Indeed , studies in adults with ARDS have shown that an increased  cumulative fluid balance  is associated with adverse outcome . However , age-related differences in the development and consequences of fluid overload in ARDS may exist due to disparities in immunologic response and body water distribution . This systematic review summarizes the current literature on fluid imbalance and management in PARDS , with special emphasis on potential differences with  adult patients .  It discusses the adverse effects associated with fluid overload and the corresponding possible pathophysiological mechanisms of its development . Our intent is to provide an incentive to develop age-specific fluid management protocol s to improve PARDS  outcomes ."
">Background  Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) agents  have considerable advances in treating  inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .  These drugs carry possible risk of adverse symptoms , and no meta- analysis has examined this issue and the potential duration -response relationship . Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess duration  -response relationship  between  anti-TNF-α agents  and risk of adverse symptoms from all available r and omized control trials ( RCTs ) with placebo arms in IBD . Methods PubMed , OVID , and Cochrane Library were search ed to January 2015 . The RCTs comparing  anti-TNF-α therapy  with  placebo  in  adults with IBD were eligible .  We estimated  pooled relative risks ( RRs )  of  adverse symptoms   for anti-TNF-α therapy  and examined both non-linear and linear  duration -response  relations between therapy duration and significant related adverse symptoms . Results  Twenty-three RCTs with 7325 patients were included  .  Adverse symptoms of headache , nausea/vomit , abdominal pain , fever , and arthralgia  showed no significant relationship  with anti-TNF-α therapy  ,  respectively . Fatigue  was significantly  associated with anti-TNF-α therapy  ( RR 1.35 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.01–1.81 ) , and subgroup analysis indicated that long therapy duration ( > 30 weeks ) and combination  without azathioprine (  AZA  )  were two risk factors for the  occurrence of fatigue  ( RR 1.74 , 95 % CI 1.03–2.93 ; RR 1.65 , 95 % CI 1.13–2.40 ) . In the  trials without AZA combination  , there was a  linear duration -response relationship between therapy duration and risk of fatigue  ( P = 0.0217 ) , and duration of 35 weeks increased  the risk of fatigue  by 50 % . Conclusion This meta- analysis suggested a promotive  effect of anti-TNF-α therapy  to the  occurrence of fatigue  ,  and for the anti-TNF-α therapy without AZA combination  , a  linear duration -response relationship  existed  between therapy duration and risk of fatigue ."
"pTreatment  intensification  to maximize disease control and reduced intensity approaches to minimize the risk of  late sequelae  have been evaluated in  newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma .  The influence of these interventions on the  risk of secondary malignant neoplasms , progression-free survival and overall survival  is reported in the meta- analysis herein , based on individual  patient data from 9498 patients treated within 16 r and omized controlled trials for newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma between 1984 and 2007 .  Secondary malignant neoplasms were meta-analyzed using Peto 's method as time-to-event outcomes . For  progression-free and overall survival  , hazard ratios derived from each trial using Cox regression were combined by inverse-variance weighting . Five study questions (  combined-modality  treatment vs.  chemotherapy  alone ; more extended vs. involved-field radiotherapy ; radiation at higher doses vs. radiation at 20 Gy ; more vs. fewer  cycles of the same chemotherapy protocol ; st and ard-dose chemotherapy vs. intensified chemotherapy )  were investigated . After a median follow-up of 7.4 years ,  dose-intensified chemotherapy  result ed in better  progression-free survival rates  ( P=0.007 ) as compared with  st  and  ard-dose chemotherapy  , but was associated with an increased  risk of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes  ( P=0.0028 ) . No  progression-free or overall survival differences  were observed between combined-modality treatment and  chemotherapy  alone , but more  secondary malignant neoplasms  were seen after combined-modality treatment ( P=0.010 ) . For the remaining three study questions ,  outcomes and secondary malignancy rates  did not differ significantly between treatment strategies . The results of this meta- analysis help to weigh up  efficacy and secondary malignancy risk  for the choice of first-line treatment for  Hodgkin lymphoma patients .  However , final conclusions regarding secondary solid tumors require longer follow-up."
" Moderate quality evidence to supports the use of  oral budesonide-MMX ®  at a 9 mg daily dose for induction  of remission  in active ulcerative colitis , particularly in  patients  with  left-sided colitis   . Budesonide-MMX ®  9 mg daily is effective for induction  of remission  in the presence or absence of concurrent 5-ASA therapy .  Further , budesonide-MMX ®  appears to be  safe  , and does not lead to significant  impairment of adrenocorticoid function  compared to  placebo  . Moderate quality evidence from a single study suggests that mesalamine may be superior to st and ard budesonide for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis . Low quality evidence from one study found  no difference in remission rates   between budesonide MMX  ® and mesalamine . Very low quality evidence from one small study  showed no difference in endoscopic remission rates  between st and ard  budesonide  and prednisolone . Low quality evidence from one study  showed no difference in remission  rates  between budesonide-MMX  ® and st and ard budesonide . Adequately powered studies are needed to allow conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy and safety  of budesonide versus prednisolone , budesonide-MMX ®  versus  st and ard budesonide and budesonide  versus mesalamine."

" Considerable variation was noted in the content , duration and intensity of the  rehabilitation  programmes included in this review , and for none of them was high- or moderate- quality evidence identified .  Exercise programmes  starting four to six weeks postsurgery seem to lead to a faster  decrease in pain and disability  than no treatment , with small to medium effect sizes , and high-intensity  exercise programmes  seem to lead to a slightly faster  decrease in pain and disability  than is seen with low-intensity programmes , but the overall quality of the evidence is only low to very low . No significant differences were noted between  supervised and home exercise programmes  for  pain relief , disability or global perceived effect .  None of the trials reported an increase in  reoperation rate  after first-time lumbar surgery . High- quality r and omised controlled trials are strongly needed."
"yNon-alcoholic  fatty liver disease  is a serious and growing clinical problem . Despite  lifestyle  modification , i.e.  diet and physical activity  , being the recommended therapy , there are currently no systematic evaluations of its efficacy . This review applies a systematic approach to evaluating  lifestyle modifications  studied to date . Medline ( Pubmed ) , Scopus , and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were search ed for studies and study groups assessing the effect of  diet , physical activity , and /or exercise modification  in  adult population s with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .  The outcome markers of interest were  indicators of steatosis , histological evidence of inflammation and fibrosis , and glucose control/insulin sensitivity .   We identified 23 studies for inclusion ; seven had control groups , but only six were r and omised . Eleven groups  received  diet-only interventions  , two  exercise-only  , and 19  diet and physical activity/exercise .  Studies consistently showed reductions in  liver fat and /or liver aminotransferase concentration  , with the strongest correlation being with  weight reduction .  Of the 5 studies reporting changes in  histopathology  , all showed a trend towards  reduction in inflammation  , in 2 this was statistically significant .  Changes in fibrosis  were less consistent with only one study showing a significant reduction . The majority of studies also reported improvements in  glucose control/insulin sensitivity  following intervention . However , study design , definition of disease , assessment methods , and interventions varied considerably across studies .  Lifestyle modifications  leading to  weight reduction  and /or  increased physical activity  consistently  reduced liver fat and improved glucose control/insulin sensitivity .  Limited data also suggest that lifestyle interventions may hold benefits for histopathology."
"tBACKGROUND  Maternal factors  , including  increasing childbearing age and various life-style factors  , are associated with poorer  short- and long-term  outcomes for children , whereas knowledge of paternal parameters is limited . Recently , increasing paternal age has been associated with adverse obstetric outcomes , birth defects , autism spectrum disorders and  schizophrenia  in  children .  OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE The aim of this systematic review is to describe the influence of  paternal factors  on adverse short- and long-term child outcomes . SEARCH METHODS PubMed , Embase  and Cochrane data bases up to January 2017  were search ed . Paternal factors examined included  paternal age and life-style factors such as body mass index ( BMI ) , adiposity and cigarette smoking .  The outcome variables assessed were  short-term outcomes  such as  preterm birth , low birth weight , small for gestational age ( SGA ) , stillbirth , birth defects and chromosomal anomalies .  Long-term outcome variables included  mortality , cancers , psychiatric diseases/disorders and metabolic diseases .  The systematic review follows PRISMA guidelines . Relevant meta-analyses were performed . OUTCOMES The search included  14 371 articles out of which 238 met the inclusion criteria , and 81 were included in quantitative synthesis  ( meta-analyses ) .  Paternal age  and  paternal  life-style  factors  have an association with adverse outcome in offspring . This is particularly evident for psychiatric disorders such as autism , autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia , but an association is also found with  stillbirth , any birth defects , orofacial clefts  and  trisomy 21 .  Paternal height , but not BMI , is associated with birth weight in offspring while paternal BMI is associated with BMI , weight and /or body fat in childhood . Paternal smoking is found to be associated with an increase  in SGA , birth defects such as congenital heart defects , and orofacial clefts , cancers , brain tumours and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia .  These associations are significant although moderate in size , with most pooled estimates between 1.05 and 1.5 , and none exceeding 2.0 . WIDER IMPLICATION S Although the increased risks of adverse outcome in offspring associated with  paternal factors  and identified in this report represent serious health effects , the magnitude of these effects seems modest."
":Background : National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guidelines recommend  surgery , chemotherapy  , and  radiation therapy  for  gastric cancer patients .   Neoadjuvant treatments  as the administration of therapeutic agents before a main treatment gained in more and more attention . However , the role of  neoadjuvant treatments  is still controversial . The main aim of this systematic review and network meta- analysis is to assess the relative  efficacy  of different  neoadjuvant treatment regimens  for gastric cancer using network meta- analysis method . Methods : We will search  5 electronic data bases  to identify  r and omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) and non- RCTs compared the  efficacy differences  of  surgery alone ( S ) , preoperative chemotherapy follow by surgery ( CTS ) , preoperative radiotherapy follow by surgery ( RTS ) , and preoperative chemoradiotherapy follow by surgery ( CRTS )  for  patients with gastric cancer .  The  risk  of bias tool from the Cochrane H and book version 5.1.0 will be used to assess the  risk of  bias of RCTs , and the  risk of  bias in nonr and omized studies of interventions ( ROBINS-I ) for non- RCTs . Data will be analyzed using R-3.4.1 software . Results and conclusion : The results of present network meta- analysis will estimate the  relative efficacy  among all interventions and rank the interventions even if head-to-head comparisons are lacking and will provide more evidence for clinicians , research ers , and patients in the management of gastric cancer .

"nGrowth  factor ( GF ) therapy  has shown promise in treating a variety of refractory wounds . However , evidence supporting its routine use in  burn injury  remains uncertain . We performed this systematic review and meta- analysis assessing r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) to investigate efficacy and safety of  GFs  in the management of  partial-thickness burns .  Electronic search es were conducted in PubMed and the Cochrane data bases . Endpoint results analysed included  wound healing and scar formation .   Thirteen studies comprising a total of 1924 participants with 2130 wounds ( 1131  GF receiving  patients versus 999 controls )  were identified and included , evaluating the effect of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) on partial-thickness burns . Topical application of these agents significantly  reduced healing time  by 5·02 ( 95 % confidence interval , 2·62 to 7·42 ) , 3·12 ( 95 % CI , 1·11 to 5·13 ) and 5·1 ( 95 % CI , 4·02 to 6·18 ) days , respectively , compared with st and ard wound care alone . In addition ,  scar improvement  following  therapy with FGF and EGF  was evident  in terms of pigmentation , pliability , height and vascularity  . No significant  increase in adverse events  was observed in patients  receiving GFs  . These results suggested  that GF therapy  could be an effective and safe add-on to st and ard wound care for partial-thickness burns . High- quality , adequately powered trials are needed to further confirm the conclusion."
" This up date of our systematic review provides evidence from eighteen trials with moderate to low risk of bias that the use of  treadmill training  in  patients with PD  may improve clinical ly relevant  gait parameters  such as  gait speed and stride length  ( moderate and low quality of evidence , respectively ) . This apparent benefit for patients is , however , not supported by all secondary variables ( e.g.  cadence and walking distance )  . Comparing  physiotherapy  and  treadmill training  against other alternatives in the treatment of gait hypokinesia such as  physiotherapy without treadmill training  this type of therapy seems to be more beneficial in practice without increased risk . The gain seems small to moderate clinical ly relevant . However , the results must be interpreted with caution because it is not known how long these improvements may last and some studies used no intervention in the control group and underlie some risk of bias . Additionally the results were heterogenous and we found variations between the trials in patient characteristics , the duration  and amount of training  , and  types of  treadmill training   applied."

">OBJECTIVE  Prehabilitation  is increasingly being used to mitigate treatment-related complications and enhance  recovery  . An individual 's state of health at diagnosis , including obesity , physical fitness and comorbidities , are influencing factors for the occurrence of adverse effects . This review explores whether  prehabilitation  works in improving  health  outcomes at or beyond the initial 30 days post-treatment and considers the utility of  prehabilitation  before cancer treatment . METHODS A data base search was conducted for  articles published with  prehabilitation  as a pre-cancer treatment intervention between 2009 and 2017 . Studies with no 30 days post-treatment data  were excluded . Outcomes post-prehabilitation were extracted for physical function , nutrition and patient-reported outcomes . RESULTS  Sixteen r and omised controlled trials with a combined 2017 participants and six observational studies with 289 participants were included .   Prehabilitation interventions  provided multi-modality components including  exercise , nutrition  and psychoeducational aspects .  Prehabilitation  improved  gait , cardiopulmonary function , urinary continence , lung function and mood  30 days post-treatment but was not consistent across studies .  When combined with rehabilitation , greater benefits were seen in  30-day gait and physical functioning  compared to prehabilitation alone . Large-scale r and omised studies are required to translate what is already known from feasibility studies to improve  overall health  and increase  long-term  cancer patient  outcomes ."

">BACKGROUND Seasonal influenza and influenza-like illnesses are widespread , with an impact on GP consultations . GPs apply many preventive and protective  measures  to prevent seasonal influenza transmission , with no clear evidence of their effectiveness in this setting . AIM To review the effectiveness of  preventive and protective measures  to reduce the transmission of seasonal influenza and influenza-like illnesses in  GP practice s.  DESIGN & SETTING A systematic review was conducted of the literature in Medline  , Embase  ,  and  the  Cochrane Central Register data bases published between January 1960 and April 2014 , later extended to January 2018 .  METHOD Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) criteria were used . Controlled trials and experimental studies were included . Study quality was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool . RESULTS Out of  5727 articles screened  , only two studies were finally retained : one study about the  seasonal influenza vaccination  of  GPs  to prevent transmission from patients or staff , and one about surface disinfection . The first study was a controlled trial , which showed limited evidence for  seasonal influenza infection reduction  among  GPs  through vaccination . The second , an experimental study , performed a  virus screening  on toys in the waiting area before and after disinfection . No study on protection measures was found that assessed the impact on  influenza transmission  in general practice s.  The evidence is scarce on interventions that reduce  influenza transmission  in  GP practice ."
"sTo compare  seroprotection  achieved by  intradermal  versus  intramuscular hepatitis B vaccine  , we conducted a systematic review of observational studies and a meta- analysis of r and omized trials . Meta- analysis of data  from 757 adults  demonstrated that intradermal  hepatitis B vaccination  was slightly ( 14 % ) less likely to achieve  seroprotection  than intramuscular  vaccination  ( risk ratio(pooled ) 0.86 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.77 - 0.95 ) . Diverse study method ologies detracted from our ability to synthesize data from these studies ; st and ardized approaches would enhance comparability of future studies .  Seroprotection  from intradermal vaccination was higher among females and children , suggesting that these population s may be most appropriate for future intradermal vaccine development efforts."
" This systematic review provided low- quality evidence regarding the efficacy of  water-based exercises  , compared with no intervention . However , there is moderate quality evidence , which suggested significant benefits of  water-based exercises  in  walking speed and balance  , compared with  l and -based exercises .  Differences appear small to be considered clinical ly relevant , and , therefore ,  water-based exercises  can be prescribed as alternative interventions , based upon individuals ' exercise preferences .

  Unpaid carers  pay an essential role in caring for  people with stroke and dementia  and the dearth of literature investigating the impact of  supportive interventions  for these carers of is surprising . The available evidence suggests that it may be possible to offer support for these carers in general practice but future research should consider focussing on the same outcome measures in order to allow comparisons across interventions.
"nBACKGROUND In this modern era of multi-modality treatment there is increasing interest in the possibility of avoiding radical surgery in complete  responders after  neo-adjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy ( LCPRT )  .  In this article , we present a systematic review of such treatments and discuss their therapeutic applicability for the future . METHODS We search ed the PubMed online libraries to identify studies that reported on the  long-term surgical and pathological outcomes  after  local excision  together with those that explored the possibility of clinical observation only in  patients achieving a complete clinical response after LCPRT  .   RESULTS Several  retrospective ( n = 10 ) , one single-arm prospect i ve , and one small r and omised  series have reported on the use of  local excision  after LCPRT and demonstrated acceptably low levels of  local recurrence  with  survival  comparable to patients progressing to conventional surgery . One prospect i ve series allocated patients to  observation  or  radical surgery  based on  histological parameters  after local excision ( ypT0 and ypT1 ) and showed no differences in outcomes . Two retrospective series from the same group on a  Brazilian cohort of patients  reported excellent  long-term outcomes  after "" wait and watch "" in complete clinical responders . However , other reports have shown no direct correlation between clinical and pathological response .   Local excision  may be an appropriate option for selected  patients  developing  good clinical response after LCPRT  . In our opinion , a policy of clinical observation in complete clinical responders after LCPRT may not be a safe strategy , unless we had robust predictive models for accurate identification of pathological complete  response  . In order to identify  patients  that may be potentially  appropriate  for such an approach we propose a clinical algorithm incorporating important clinical , radiological , and pathological parameters . The proposed model will require validation in a prospect i ve study . Finally , we need r and omised data for demonstrating the non-inferiority of clinical observation compared to conventional surgery before this can be considered as st and ard possible therapeutic option."
"sObjectives  Fatigue  is common among  children living with cancer  , particularly in advance stages . Little is known about the effectiveness of  non-pharmacological approaches  to manage this complex and distressing symptom among  children .  Thus , the present paper aim to critically examine the effectiveness and setting for  non-pharmacological interventions  to manage  fatigue   among children with cancer .  Methods  Six electronic data bases were screened first in February 2013 and at second instance in March 2015 .  They include PsycINFO , Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , Scopus and Cochrane library . All data bases were systematic ally search ed for literature on  fatigue and cancer , limited to children ( as age group ) and English language .  Results  1498 articles were identified ,  of which six  were  review ed . Three types of interventions for managing  fatigue  were identified including ( 1 )  complementary and alternative medicine ( healing touch/massage therapy ) , ( 2 ) exercise-based interventions  and  ( 3 ) nursing-based interventions .  Most interventions were delivered during active treatment and in hospital setting s where parents were involved to optimise participation . Despite  fatigue scores  being lower among intervention groups , no study findings were observed as being statistically significant . Conclusion  Fatigue  is common among  children treated for and living with cancer .  The most appropriate setting to deliver  non-pharmacological interventions  to manage  fatigue  appears to be in hospital . However , in absence of any strong evidence , professionals need to be cautious about existing  non-pharmacological interventions .  Future research must adopt more rigorous research design s that are adequately powered using vali date d measures to identify potential benefits . In addition , research ers may wish to test psychosocial interventions shown to be of benefit in adults."

" This review indicates that nutritional education or advice can positively affect  physical function and diet  , whilst complex interventions with nutritional education as a component , can reduce   depression   in  people over 65 years who live at home .  However , more research is needed to determine whether outcomes are influenced by types of intervention , morbidity , and socioeconomic circumstance of participants . RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nutritional education , alone or as part of a complex intervention , can improve  diet and physical function  and may reduce  depression  in the over 65 s living at home."

"dWhile breastfeeding initiation rates for  African American mothers  are low , an innovative model of  group prenatal care  ,  CenteringPregnancy  , holds promise to increase breastfeeding rates . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to examine the effects of  CenteringPregnancy versus individual prenatal care  on   breastfeeding initiation  among African American mothers .  Using a systematic approach and PRISMA guidelines , 4 electronic data bases were used to search the literature . English- language studies , comparing  CenteringPregnancy   and  individual prenatal care   ,  including African American participants  , and specifying breastfeeding initiation as an outcome were screened for inclusion . Study strength and quality were assessed and  7 studies were systematic ally review  ed and meta-analyzed . Participation in  CenteringPregnancy  increased the  probability of breastfeeding initiation  by 53 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 29%-81 % ) ( n = 8047 ) . A subgroup analysis of breastfeeding initiation among  only African American participants  was performed on 4 studies where data were available . Participation in  CenteringPregnancy  increased the  probability of breastfeeding initiation  by 71 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 27%-131 % ) (  n = 1458 ) for African American participants .   CenteringPregnancy  is an effective intervention to increase  breastfeeding initiation  for  participants  , especially  for African Americans .  To close the racial gap in breastfeeding initiation , high- quality research providing specific outcomes for  African American participants in CenteringPregnancy  are needed."
"dObjective : To investigate the effects of  backward gait training  on  balance , gross motor function , and gait parameters  in  children with cerebral palsy .  Data sources : PubMed , Cochrane Library , Web of Science , Science Direct , Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) , and Google Scholar were search ed up to May 2018 . Review methods : R and omized controlled trials were included if they involved any form of  backward gait training  for  children with cerebral palsy .  Two authors independently screened articles , extracted data and assessed the method ological quality using  PEDro  scale , with any confliction resolved by the third author . Modified  Sackett Scale  was used to determine the level of evidence for each outcome . Results : Out of  1492 papers screened , 7 studies with 172 participants met the inclusion criteria .  The duration of treatment ranged from 15 to 25 minutes , three times a week and for 6–12 weeks . The quality of studies ranged from good ( two studies ) to fair ( four studies ) and poor ( one study ) , with a  mean PEDro  score of 4.7 out of 10 . All included studies showed positive effects in the measured outcomes . The results  showed level 1b evidence for balance  when compared to no intervention , and  for gross motor function , step length and walking speed  when compared to same dose  of forward gait training .  The clinical heterogeneity of studies makes meta- analysis inappropriate . Conclusion : In  children with cerebral palsy  , there is moderate evidence  that backward gait training   improves balance , gross motor function , step length and walking velocity .  More high- quality studies are needed."
"sBACKGROUND  Peer support  has been suggested as a promising approach for  diabetes management  . No conclusive evidence exists on the effects of  peer support  on  self-efficacy and quality of life  in  adults with type 2 diabetes .  OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of  peer support  on  self-efficacy and the quality of life  in  adults with type 2 diabetes .  DESIGN A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled studies . DATA SOURCES We search ed PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Allied Health Literature data base guide for relevant literature s from inception to 30 September 2017 . REVIEW METHODS The review was conducted according to the guidelines of Cochrane Collaboration . The outcomes were  self-efficacy and quality of life .  The st and ardized mean difference and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for pooled results . RESULTS  A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria .  The pooled results revealed  that peer support  did not significantly  improve self-efficacy and quality of life  in adults with type 2 diabetes , but significantly  improved self-efficacy and quality of life  in studies with intervention duration ≤6 months . There was no evidence of publication bias .   Peer support intervention  did not lead to better effects on the  improvement in self-efficacy and quality of life  among  adults with type 2 diabetes .   However , peer support  with intervention duration not more than 6 months had positive effects  on self-efficacy and quality of life .  More high- quality studies with large sample size are needed to support or counter the results."
"sBackground  Blood eosinophil count  has been proposed as a predictor of response to  inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS )  in the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD . An optimal threshold of blood eosinophil count for prescribing  ICS  has not been agreed . Doubt has been cast on the role by observational studies . The role of inhaled corticosteroids in this relationship , independent of long-acting bronchodilators , has not been examined . Methods We conducted a systematic review of post-hoc analyses of  r and omised  controlled trials  (  RCTs  )  and observational studies examining three blood eosinophil thresholds and the independent role of  ICS .  Included studies were categorised by the form ( relative or absolute count ) and cut point of eosinophil threshold used . Thresholds assessed were relative eosinophil count of 2 % , and absolute counts of 150 cells/μL and 300 cells/μL. Three meta-analyses of the effect of  ICS  use in post-hoc analyses of RCTs based on these counts were carried out . Initial analysis included all studies of  ICS  vs. any  non-ICS  regimen . Further analysis examined the effect of  ICS  , independent of the effect of long-acting bronchodilators . Results Sixteen studies examined the association  between blood eosinophil count and response of exacerbation risk to ICS  , in  COPD patients . Eleven studies ( 25,881 patients )  were post-hoc analyses of RCTs .  Five studies ( 109,704 patients )  were retrospective observational studies . The independent effect  of ICS  on  the reduction of exacerbation risk  was 20 % at ≥2 % blood eosinophil threshold ( RR , 0.80 ; 95 % CI , 0.74–0.85 ) , 35 % at ≥150 cells/μL blood eosinophil threshold ( RR , 0.65 ; 0.52–0.79 ) , and 39 % at ≥300 cells/μL blood eosinophil threshold ( RR , 0.61 ; 0.44–0.78 ) . No association was found in four out of five observational studies . Conclusion This is the first systematic review to assess , in post-hoc analyses of RCTs , the independent effect  of ICS  in reducing  the risk of COPD exacerbation  across a range of blood eosinophil thresholds . Association between  ICS  prescription and  reduced exacerbation risk  at these thresholds was confirmed . The lack of association found in the observational studies questions the relevance of these observations to a “ real world  ” COPD population .  To clarify the clinical utility of this biomarker , the association should be tested in prospect i ve effectiveness studies."
"dMalignant  peritoneal mesothelioma  is a rare disease , with approximately  800 new patients per year in the United States .  Its natural history is defined by progression restricted to the peritoneal space . In the past ,  patients  with this disease had a limited lifespan of approximately 1 year . Numerous single-institution studies as well as a systematic review have reported  median survival  of 3 to 5 years with a combination of  cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic perioperative chemotherapy .  These markedly improved survival statistics were achieved in experienced centers with 1 % mortality and 20 % morbidity rates . Data have shown that knowledgeable patient selection is required to prevent patients unlikely to benefit from undergoing these interventions . The conclusion is that  patients with peritoneal mesothelioma  can experience  long-term progression-free survival or significant palliation  with  cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic perioperative chemotherapy .  This management plan should be considered the st and ard of care for properly selected  patients with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma  at experienced centers around the world."
 There is not strong evidence to recommend any specific educational intervention for wide-spread implementation . Future studies are required to determine the effectiveness of culturally-competent interventions reaching diverse population.
" The new drugs for non-small-cell  lung cancer  extend life by only a few months compared with BSC , but appear to do so without net loss in  quality of life  and at a cost per LYG that is much lower than for many other NHS activities . Depending on assumptions used , these new drugs range from being  cost-effective  , as conventionally accepted , to being  cost-saving .   - IMPLICATION S OF THE NEWER DRUGS : One of the present constraints on chemotherapy is availability of inpatient beds . The advent of newer and gentler forms of  chemotherapy  given on an outpatient basis would not only overcome this , but it would allow more patients to be treated . This might apply particularly to  older patients .  The treatment of more patients would increase workload for oncologists , cancer nurses and pharmacists . The Government has already announced increased expenditure on staff for cancer care . The previously pessimistic attitudes to  chemotherapy  in non-small-cell lung cancer are changing in the wake of the newer agents , and this shift is likely to increase referral .  - NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH : Recent advances in  chemotherapy  are welcome , but their effects remain small for  patients with non-small-cell lung cancer .  Much more research is needed into better drugs , better combinations , new ways of assessing the likelihood of response and especially direct comparisons between the new regimens . This research would be aided by having a  greater proportion of patients  involved in trials , but there will be infrastructure implication s of increased participation."

" Despite the poor overall quality of studies , structured  programmes  , regardless of content , compared with st and ard care appear to influence the  uptake and duration of exclusive breastfeeding and any breastfeeding .  In healthcare setting s with low breastfeeding uptake and duration rates ,  structured programmes  may have a greater benefit . In countries where breastfeeding uptake is already high , the benefit is less apparent . The extent to which  structured programmes  in different maternity acute care setting s have a significant effect on the  duration of exclusive breastfeeding  at six months is less clear . Most of the recommendations of this review were based on observational studies and retrospective data collection . Few studies controlled for any potential confounding factors and the impact of bias has to be considered . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE Acute maternity care setting s should implement  structured programmes to support breastfeeding  as part of routine maternity care . Programmes can replicate an existing programme , such as the BFHI , in full or in part , or be specifically developed to support implementation of evidence to reflect the needs and dem and s of the local healthcare organisation . In healthcare setting s which have a high uptake of breastfeeding , re sources may be better directed at improving support for  duration of exclusive breastfeeding  in the community . IMPLICATION S FOR RESEARCH Further high quality RCTs are needed which address the impact of introduction of  structured programmes  on  women 's experiences of infant feeding  , on the  role of the relevant healthcare professionals  and on  short and longer-term health outcomes .  Prospect i ve data capture to inform economic analyses should also be undertaken . Trial interventions need to be well defined and implementation processes described to inform reproducibility across different locations and different country setting s. Research is also needed to address the issue of which elements of a  structured programme  are likely to lead to the  most clinical and cost effective  use of healthcare re sources and to address how sustainable these interventions are in health systems facing increased economic pressures."

" The supportive care needs of  breast cancer women  during long-term survivorship are slightly explored , comparing to antineoplasmatic treatment period supportive care needs . This is probably due to the subjective nature of the concept examined . Approximately every scientific team worked on the study of supportive care needs on two or three different dimensions . More frequently examined are  Physical and Psychological  Care Needs . Gap is observed in exploring the social/economical and spiritual supportive care needs of  women with breast cancer survivors  as well as practical needs."

"sAccuracy in quantifying  energy intake  ( EI ) using common dietary assessment methods is crucial for interpreting the relationship between diet and chronic disease . The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the validity of  dietary assessment  methods used to estimate the EI  of adults  in comparison to total energy expenditure ( TEE ) measured by  doubly labeled water ( DLW ) .   Articles in English across nine electronic data bases , published between 1973 and February 2019  were retrieved .  Studies were included if participants were adults ( ≥18 years ) and used the  DLW technique  to measure TEE compared to self-reported EI  .  A total of 59 studies were included , with a total of 6,298 free living adults and a mean of 107 participants per study .  The majority of studies including 16 studies that included a technology based method reported significant ( P <  0.05 ) under-reporting of EI  when compared to TEE , with few over-reporting  EI . Misreporting  was more frequent among females compared to males within recall based dietary assessment methods .  The  degree of  under-reporting  was highly variable within studies using the same method , with 24 h recalls having less variation and degree of under-reporting compared to other methods."
" Moderate- quality evidence suggests reduced risks of  GDM and caesarean section  with  combined diet and exercise interventions  during pregnancy as well as reductions in  gestational weight gain  , compared with st and ard care . There were no clear differences in  hypertensive disorders of pregnancy , perinatal mortality , large-for-gestational age , perineal trauma , neonatal hypoglycaemia , and childhood adiposity  ( moderate- tovery low- quality evidence ) .Using GRADE methodology , the evidence was assessed as moderate to very low quality . Downgrading decisions were predominantly due to design limitations ( risk of bias ) , and imprecision ( uncertain effect estimates , and at times , small sample sizes and low event rates ) , however two outcomes  ( pregnancy-induced hypertension/hypertension and neonatal hypoglycaemia )  , were also down grade d for unexplained inconsistency ( statistical heterogeneity).Due to the variability of the diet and exercise components tested in the included studies , the evidence in this review has limited ability to inform practice . Future studies could describe the interventions used in more detail , if and how these influenced behaviour change and ideally be st and ardised between studies . Studies could also consider using existing core outcome sets to facilitate more st and ardised reporting."
" An attempt was made to develop recommendations in each of the subcategories of  suctioning  techniques addressed by at least one study . In some subcategories , definite recommendations were made ( 13 in adults , and three in children and infants ) ; in other subcategories , insufficient evidence precluded recommendations . The recommendations addressed the following aspects of suctioning : preoxygenation , hyperinflation , insufflation , hyperoxygenation , hyperventilation , saline instillation , adaptor use , medication use , open and closed systems , and various types of catheters."

"  Automated closed loop systems  may result in  reduced duration of weaning , ventilation and ICU stay  . Reductions are more likely to occur in mixed or medical ICU population s. Due to the lack of , or limited , evidence on  automated systems  other than  Smartcare/PS  ™ and  Adaptive Support Ventilation  no conclusions can be drawn regarding their influence on these outcomes . Due to substantial heterogeneity in trials there is a need for an adequately powered , high quality , multi-centre r and omized controlled trial in  adults  that excludes  ' simple to wean ' patients  . There is a pressing need for further technological development and research in the  paediatric population ."

"sBACKGROUND An overview of promising prognostic variables and predictive subgroups concerning the  curative  treatment of  esophageal and gastric cancer  from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) is lacking . Therefore , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis . METHODS PubMed , EMBASE , CENTRAL , and ASCO/ESMO conferences were search ed  up to March 2019  for  RCTs on the  curative treatment  of esophageal or gastric cancer with data on prognostic and /or predictive factors for overall survival .  Prognostic factors were deemed potentially clinical ly relevant according to the following criteria ; ( 1 ) statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) in a multivariate analysis , ( 2 ) reported in at least 250 patients , and ( 3 ) p < 0.05 , in ≥ 33 % of the total number of patients in  RCTs  reporting this factor . Predictive factors were potentially clinical ly-relevant if ( 1 ) the p-value for interaction between subgroups was < 0.20 and ( 2 ) the hazard ratio in one of the subgroups was significant ( p < 0.05 ) . RESULTS For  gastric cancer , 39 RCTs were identified ( n = 13,530 patients ) and , for esophageal cancer , 33 RCTs were identified ( n = 8618 patients ) .  In total , we identified 23  potentially  clinical  ly relevant prognostic factors  for gastric cancer and 16 for esophageal cancer . There were 15 potentially clinical ly  relevant predictive factors  for gastric cancer and 10 for esophageal cancer .  The identified  prognostic and predictive factors  can be included and analyzed in future RCTs and be of guidance for nomograms . Further validation should be performed in large patient cohorts."

")Background : Currently ,  preoperative chemoradiotherapy , perioperative chemotherapy and preoperative chemotherapy  are recommended by NCCN , ESMO and Japanese guidelines respectively for  resectable esophageal and junctional cancer .  However , these recommendations are mainly based on esophageal  cancer  research . Therefore , specific for  esophagogastric junction cancer  , we conducted the first systematic review and network meta- analysis to rank all potential treatments simultaneously and hierarchically . Methods : Record retrieval was conducted in PubMed , Web of Science , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Embase , ASCO and ESMO Meeting Library from inception to September 2018 . Regarding  time-to-event survival  data , r and omized controlled trials featuring comparisons between different multimodal treatments against  resectable esophagogastric junction cancer  were eligible .  Overall survival  was the endpoint .  Network  calculation was based on a r and om-effects model and the relative ranking of each node was numerically indicated by P-score ( CRD42018110369 , registration identifier of the meta- analysis in PROSPERO . ) . Results :  Eight studies were included in our systematic review , corresponding to 1218 patients .  Regarding  overall survival  , ‘ PreCRT ’  ( preoperative chemoradiotherapy )  topped the hierarchy ( HR 1.00 , P-score = 0.823 ) , better than ‘ PeriCT  ’ ( perioperative chemotherapy ;  HR 1.32 , P-score = 0.591 ) and ‘ PreCT  ’ ( preoperative chemotherapy ;  HR 1.54 , P-score = 0.428 ) . In sensitivity analyses , irrespective of interchanging to fixed-effects model or removing potentially heterogeneous studies ,  relative rankings  remained stable and ‘ PreCRT ’ was still the optimal node . Conclusion :  Preoperative chemoradiotherapy  could potentially be the optimal multimodal treatment , which displayed more  overall survival  benefits  than perioperative chemotherapy and preoperative chemotherapy   among resectable esophagogastric junction cancer patients .  To further verify our pooled results , more r and omized trials will be needed to  compare preoperative chemoradiotherapy with perioperative chemotherapy  ( especially  FLOT-based regimens  )."

"dCONTEXT  Sedation  has become an integral part of critical care practice in minimizing patient discomfort ; however , sedatives have adverse effects and the potential to prolong mechanical ventilation , which may increase health care  costs  . OBJECTIVE To determine which form of sedation is associated with  optimal sedation  , the  shortest time to extubation  , and  length of intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay .  DATA SOURCES A key word search of MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Collaboration data bases and  h and search es of 6 anesthesiology journals from 1980 to June 1998 .  Experts and industry representatives were contacted , personal files were search ed , and reference lists of relevant primary and review articles were review ed . STUDY SELECTION Studies included were  r and omized controlled trials enrolling adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation and requiring short-term or  long-term sedation  .  At least 2 sedative agents had to be compared and the  quality of sedation , time to extubation , or length of ICU stay  analyzed . DATA EXTRACTION Data on  population , intervention , outcome , and method ological quality  were extracted in duplicate by 2 of 3 investigators using 8 validity criteria . DATA SYNTHESIS Of  49 identified r and omized controlled trials  , 32 met our  selection criteria  ; 20 studied  short-term sedation  and 14 ,  long-term sedation .  Of these , 20 compared  propofol  with  midazolam .  Most trials were not double-blind and did not report or st and ardize important co interventions . Propofol provides at least as  effective sedation  as  midazolam  and results in a faster  time to extubation  , with an increased  risk of hypotension and higher cost .  Insufficient data exist to determine effect on  length of stay in the ICU .  Isoflurane demonstrated some  advantages  over midazolam , and ketamine had a more  favorable hemodynamic profile  than fentanyl in  patients with head injuries .   Considering the widespread use of sedation for  critically ill patients  , more large , high- quality , r and omized controlled trials of the effectiveness of different agents for short-term and long-term sedation are warranted."
"nInfluenza infection is a potential cause of excess morbidity in  patients who are immunosuppressed because of haemato-oncological malignancy or its treatment .  Therefore  vaccination against influenza  is recommended in these patient groups . This systematic review of the literature and vaccine manafacturers ' data assesses the current levels of knowledge concerning  influenza vaccination  in this patient group  .  There is a paucity of data , and the patient  groups  in the studies are heterogeneous .  Serological responses  are generally lower than expected in healthy controls and may be critically dependent on the timing of vaccination relative to chemotherapy .  Antibody levels  considered protective in healthy individuals may not prevent clinical infection in those with malignant disease . There are no data on protection from clinical infection . The  vaccine  appears to be  well tolerated  in this patient group . It is reasonable to offer vaccination to  patients receiving treatment for haemato-oncological disorders .  However , the  degree of clinical protection  afforded may be inferior to that experienced by healthy individuals . Further trials are warranted to assess the magnitude of benefit and optimal schedules of vaccination."
"kOBJECTIVE We aim ed to systematic ally review available literature linking adipokines to  gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM )  for a comprehensive underst and ing of the roles of adipokines in the development of GDM . METHODS We search ed PubMed / MEDLINE and EMBASE data bases for  published studies on adipokines and GDM through October 21 , 2014 .  We included  articles if they had a prospect i ve study design ( i.e.  ,   blood sample s for adipokines measurement were collected  before GDM diagnosis ) .  R and om-effects models were used to pool the weighted mean differences comparing levels of adipokines between  GDM cases and non-GDM controls .  RESULTS  Of 1523 potentially relevant articles ,  we included  25 prospect i ve studies  relating  adipokines to incident GDM .  Our meta- analysis of nine prospect i ve studies on adiponectin and eight prospect i ve studies on leptin indicated that  adiponectin levels  in the first or early second trimester of pregnancy were 2.25 μg/ml lower ( 95 % CI : 1.75 - 2.75 ) ,  whereas leptin levels  were 7.25 ng/ml higher ( 95 % CI 3.27 - 11.22 ) , among women who later developed GDM than women who did not . Prospect i ve data were sparse and findings were inconsistent  for visfatin , retinol binding protein ( RBP-4 ) , resistin , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , and vaspin  . We did not identify prospect i ve studies for several novel  adipokines  ,  including chemerin , apelin , omentin , or adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein .  Moreover , no published prospect i ve studies with longitudinal assessment of adipokines and incident GDM were identified .   Adiponectin levels  in the first or second trimester of pregnancy are lower among  pregnant women who later develop GDM  than  non-GDM women  ,  whereas leptin levels  are higher . Well- design ed prospect i ve studies with longitudinal assessment of adipokines during pregnancy are needed to underst and the trajectories and dynamic associations of adipokines with GDM risk."
"rA systematic review was conducted to investigate the use of  technology  in achieving  behaviour change  in  chronic illness .  The areas review ed were : ( 1 ) methods employed to adapt  traditional therapy  from a  face-to-face medium  to  a computer-assisted platform ;  ( 2 ) targets of behaviour change ; and ( 3 ) level of human  (  e.g.  therapist )  involvement . The initial literature search produced  2032 articles .  A total of  45 articles reporting 33 separate interventions  met the inclusion /exclusion criteria and were review ed in detail . The majority of interventions reported a theoretical basis , with many arising from a cognitive-behavioural framework . There was a wide range of therapy content .  Therapist involvement  was reported in 73 % of the interventions . A common problem was  high  participant  attrition  , which may have been related to reduced levels of human interaction . Instigating successful behaviour change through technological  interventions  poses many difficulties . However , there are potential benefits of delivering therapy in this way . For  people with long-term health conditions  ,  technological self-management systems  could provide a practical method of underst and ing and monitoring their condition , as well as therapeutic guidance to alter maladaptive behaviour."

"yAIM To define the best sequence of  radiotherapy and chemotherapy  for  inoperable stage III non-small cell lung ( NSCL ) tumours .  MATERIAL S AND METHODS A systematic review was performed on the clinical results of  radiotherapy , combined or not with chemotherapy  , for  inoperable NSCL cancer stage III .  The  mean median survival time ( MST ) and mean overall survival ( OS ) percentages  were derived for  radiotherapy  only , for  sequential  and for  concurrent chemo-radiotherapy .  RESULTS The  mean median survival duration  + /- st and ard deviation for  radiotherapy  only was 10.4 + /- 1.8 months . For  sequential chemo- and radiotherapy  it was increased to 13.0 + /- 1.2 months . When  radiotherapy  in the sequential regimen was accompanied by  chemotherapy  , the  mean median duration  was 15.8 + /- 2.6 months . For  concurrent radio-chemotherapy  it was further increased to 16.4 + /- 2.7 months . The  mean 2- and 3-year overall survivals  for  radiotherapy alone  ,  sequential and concurrent radio-chemotherapy  were 17.1 + /- 4.6 and 10 , 23.8 + /- 6.3 and 18.5 + /- 7.0 , and 32.5 + /- 8.7 and 25.7 + /- 6.3 % , respectively .   Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy  demonstrated increased  efficacy  over  sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy  and should be the treatment of choice . Further improvements may be obtained by optimising the conditions for concurrent chemo-radiotherapy."
" Although the results suggest that  carboplatin + S-1 and necitumumab  in  combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin  may have value in terms of OS versus other comparators , the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of studies ( with few focused exclusively on squamous NSCLC ) and wide credible intervals."
"CThe  effectiveness  of  neoadjuvant therapy ( NAT )  remains unclear in  resectable pancreatic cancer ( PC )  as compared with  upfront surgery ( US  ) . The aim of this study was to investigate the  survival gain  of  NAT  over  US  in  resectable PC  . PubMed and EMBASE were search ed for studies comparing  survival outcomes  between   NAT  and  US  for resectable PC  until June 2018 .  Overall survival ( OS )  was analyzed according to treatment strategy  ( NAT versus US )  and analytic methods ( intention-to-treat analysis ( ITT ) and per- protocol analysis ( PP ) ) .  In 14 studies , 2,699 and 6,992 patients were treated with  NAT and US  , respectively  . Although PP analysis showed the  survival gain  of NAT ( HR 0.72 , 95 % CI 0.68–0.76 ) , ITT analysis did not show the statistical significance ( HR 0.96 , 95 % CI 0.82–1.12 ) . However , NAT completed with subsequent surgery showed  better survival  over US completed with adjuvant therapy ( HR 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.71–0.93 ) . In conclusion , the supporting evidence for  NAT  in resectable PC was insufficient because the benefit was not demonstrated in ITT analysis . However , among the patients who completed both surgery and  chemotherapy , NAT   showed survival benefit  over  adjuvant therapy . Therefore , NAT  could have a role of triaging the patients for surgery even in resectable PC."
">PURPOSE To perform a meta- analysis in order to quantify the actual cumulative r and omized evidence for the benefit and toxicity of  trastuzumab combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy  in  HER2-positive breast cancer .  METHODS Potentially eligible trials were located through PubMed and Cochrane Library search es and abstract s of major international conferences . The endpoints that we assessed were  pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate , breast-conserving surgery ( BCS ) rate and toxicity .  RESULTS  Five trials were identified with 515 eligible patients .  The probability to  achieve pCR  was higher for the  trastuzumab plus chemotherapy  arm ( RR 1.85 , 95 % CI : 1.39 - 2.46 ; p-value < 0.001 ) . No significant difference in terms  of breast-conserving surgery  between the two treatment arms was observed ( OR : 0.98 , 95 % CI : 0.80 - 1.19 , p-value = 0.82 ) . Regarding  toxicity  , the addition of trastuzumab did not increase the  incidence of neutropenia , neutropenic fever , and cardiac adverse events .   The addition of trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting improves the probability of achieving higher  pCR  with no additional toxicity . Based on the available evidence , the use of  trastuzumab combined with neoadjuvant chemothetherapy  in  patients with HER2-positive breast cancer  seems to offer substantial benefit in terms of  pCR ."

We are uncertain whether intradermal fractional-dose (  one-fifth  )  IPV  has better protective effects and causes fewer  adverse events  in children than intramuscular full-dose IPV."
">We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to estimate the potential association between LCω-3PUFAs and   prostate cancer  ( PC ) .  A comprehensive literature search was performed through 2013 to identify  prospect  i ve studies that examined  dietary intakes of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LCω-3PUFA )  or  blood biomarkers of LCω-3PUFA  status and risk of PC . R and om-effects meta-analyses were conducted to generate  summary relative risk estimates ( SRREs )  for LCω-3PUFAs and total PC , and by stage and grade . Subgroup analyses were also conducted for specific fatty acids and other study characteristics .  Twelve  self-reported dietary intake  and 9  biomarker studies  from independent study population s were included in the analysis , with 446,243 and 14,897 total participants , respectively .  No association  between LCω-3PUFAs and total PC  was observed ( SRRE = 1.00 , 95 % CI : 0.93–1.09 ) for the dietary intake studies ( high vs. low LCω-3PUFAs category comparison ) or for the biomarker studies ( SRRE of 1.07 , 95 % CI : 0.94–1.20 ) . In general , most  summary associations  for the dietary intake studies were in the inverse direction , whereas the majority of  summary associations  for the biomarker studies were in the positive direction , but all were weak in magnitude . The results from this meta- analysis do not support an association  between LCω-3PUFAs and PC ."

"yFirst-line  chemotherapy + bevacizumab ( BEV )  is one of the st and ards of care in advanced colorectal cancer (  CRC  ) . Contrary to anti-EGFR agents , it is currently not possible to identify the ideal c and i date for  BEV-based chemotherapy  due to the lack of predictors of outcomes . The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of risk factors for survival after  B-based chemotherapy  for CRC . We performed a meta- analysis by search ing on the data bases PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science and SCOPUS for a published series that focused on prognostic factors  for BEV-based therapy  in advanced CRC  . Pooled hazard ratios ( HR )  were calculated by using a r and om-effects model for parameters that could be considered as potential prognostic factors in ≥3 papers .  Twenty-nine studies , which included a total of 11,585 patients , were considered in this analysis  . Five parameters were associated with survival in ≥3 papers : ( 1 ) a  longer progression-free interval  [ PFS : HR 0.87 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.78–0.97 ; P = 0.01 ] ; ( 2 )  a single site of metastases  ( HR 0.63 , 95 % CI 0.56–0.71 ; P < 0.00001 ) ; ( 3 )  elevated lactate dehydrogenase  ( LDH : HR 2.08 , 95 % CI 1.69–2.57 ; P < 0.00001 ) ; ( 4 )  KRAS mutation  ( HR 1.66 , 95 % CI 1.36–2.03 ; P < 0.00001 ) ; and ( 5 )  poor performance status  ( PS : HR 1.99 , 95 % CI 1.41–2.82 ; P < 0.0001 ) . Clinical variables associated with  prolonged survival  , after first-line  treatment with chemotherapy + BEV  for  metastatic CRC patients  ,  included long PFS , low LDH levels , KRAS wild-type status , good PS and a single site of metastasis  . They should be considered when stratifying patients for inclusion in r and omized trials . Investigations into new prognostic factors based on tumor biology are needed and of high priority."
"tPostoperative pain management remains a significant challenge for all  healthcare providers .  The objective of this systematic review was to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of  acupuncture and related techniques  as adjunct analgesics for  acute postoperative pain management .  We search ed the data bases of Medline ( 1966 - 2007 ) , CINAHL , The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( 2006 ) , and Scopus for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) using  acupuncture  for  postoperative pain management .  We extracted data about   postoperative opioid consumption , postoperative pain intensity  ,  and opioid-related side-effects  .  Combined data were analysed using a r and om effects model .  Fifteen RCTs comparing  acupuncture  with  sham control  in the management of acute postoperative pain were included .   Weighted mean difference for cumulative opioid analgesic consumption  was -3.14 mg ( 95 % confidence interval , CI : -5.15 , -1.14 ) , -8.33 mg ( 95 % CI : -11.06 , -5.61 ) , and -9.14 mg ( 95 % CI : -16.07 , -2.22 ) at 8 , 24 , and 72 h , respectively .  Postoperative pain intensity ( visual analogue scale  , 0 - 100 mm ) was also significantly decreased in the acupuncture group at 8 and 72 h compared with the control group . The  acupuncture  treatment group was associated with a lower  incidence of opioid-related side-effects such  as  nausea  ( relative risk , RR : 0.67 ; 95 % CI : 0.53 , 0.86 ) ,  dizziness  ( RR : 0.65 ; 95 % CI : 0.52 , 0.81 ) ,  sedation  ( RR : 0.78 ; 95 % CI : 0.61 , 0.99 ) ,  pruritus  ( RR : 0.75 ; 95 % CI : 0.59 , 0.96 ) , and  urinary retention  ( RR : 0.29 ; 95 % CI : 0.12 , 0.74 ) .  Perioperative acupuncture  may be a useful adjunct for acute postoperative pain management."
"dBackground Encouraging  men  to make more effective use of  ( preventive  )  health services  is considered one way of improving their health . The aim of this study was to appraise the available evidence of effective interventions aim ed at improving  men 's health .  Methods Systematic review of relevant studies identified through  14 electronic data bases  and other information re sources . Results were pooled within health topic and described qualitatively . Results  Of 11,749 citations screened , 338 articles were assessed and 27 met our inclusion criteria .  Most studies were male sex-specific , i.e. prostate cancer screening and testicular self-examination . Other topics included  alcohol , cardiovascular disease , diet  and  physical activity  ,  skin cancer  and  smoking cessation  . Twenty-three interventions were effective or partially  effective  and 18 studies satisfied all quality criteria . Conclusion Most of the existing evidence relates to male sex-specific health problems as opposed to general health concerns relevant to both men and women . There is little published evidence on how to improve men  's uptake of services .  We can not conclude from this review that targeting men works better than providing services for all people . Large-scale studies are required to help produce evidence that is sufficiently robust to add to the small evidence base that currently exists in this field."
"nNonalcoholic  fatty liver disease ( NAFLD )  is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized countries . The increasing prevalence of NAFLD mirrors the outbreak of obesity in western countries , highlighting the connection between these two conditions . Nevertheless , there is currently no specific pharmacotherapy for its treatment . Accepted management begins with  weight loss and exercise .  Moreover ,  exercise  can provide metabolic benefits independently of weight loss . It is known how long-term  aerobic training  produces improvements in  hepatic triglycerides , visceral adipose tissue and free fatty acids  , even if there is no  weight reduction .  A recent study from Boström et al. unravels a potential molecular mechanism that may explain how  exercise  , independently of weight loss , can potentially improve  metabolic parameters  through a new messenger system ( irisin ) linking muscle and fat tissue . Irisin has been proposed to act as a hormone on subcutaneous white fat cells increasing  energy expenditure  by means of a program of  brown-fat-like development .  Moreover , it was also shown that  irisin plasma concentration  was higher in  people who exercise  , suggesting a molecular mechanism by which exercise may improve  metabolism .  The present systematic review is based on the possibility that irisin might represent a hypothetical connection between NAFLD  pathogenesis  and disease progression."
"sPublic debate over the safety of the trivalent  measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine  and the drop in vaccination rates in several countries persists despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness . We carried out a systematic review to assess the evidence of unintended effects ( beneficial or harmful ) associated with  MMR  and the applicability of systematic review ing methods to the field of safety evaluation . Eligible studies were  comparative prospect i ve or retrospective on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age , carried out or published by 2003 .  We identified  120 articles satisfying our inclusion criteria and included 22 .   MMR  is associated with a lower incidence of  upper respiratory tract infections  , a higher incidence of  irritability  , similar incidence of other adverse effects compared to  placebo  and is likely to be associated with benign thrombocytopenic purpura ( TP ) , parotitis , joint and limb complaints and aseptic meningitis ( mumps Urabe strain-containing MMR ) . Exposure to  MMR  is unlikely to be associated with Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , autism or aseptic meningitis ( mumps Jeryl-Lynn strain-containing MMR ) . The design and reporting of  safety outcomes  in  MMR vaccine  studies , both pre- and post-marketing , are largely inadequate . The evidence of  adverse events  following immunization with  MMR  can not be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases."
"dIn the United States , cancer is the second leading cause of death after heart disease and is the leading cause of death in  persons younger than 65 years of age  . Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the second and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women , respectively , and overall , is the third most common type of cancer in men  and women .  In 2006 , it was estimated that 148610  new cases of CRC  occurred and that  51170 patients died  of  the  disease ( 1 , 2 ) . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) strongly recommends screening for  men and women 50 years of age or older for CRC  ( A recommendation ) ( 3 ) . Biannual  fecal occult blood testing  can reduce  CRC-related death  by 21 % , and it has been reported that  flexible sigmoidoscopy  reduces  death  by 60 % for lesions within reach of the instrument . Further , data suggest that  sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy  when polyps are found could decrease  CRC incidence  by up to 80 % ( 4 ) . Despite evidence of the effectiveness of several screening methods , adoption of routine  CRC screening  by eligible individuals , using any method , continues to be low in the United States ( 58 ) . A  CRC  chemoprophylactic strategy may be used as a complement to or instead of a screening strategy . Several basic science , population -based , and experimental studies have suggested a  protective effect  of  aspirin ( ASA )  and  non-ASA nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs )  , including  cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors  , on  colorectal adenomas and CRC .  However , 2 long-term , r and omized , controlled trials , the Physicians ' Health Study ( 9 ) and the Women 's Health Study ( 10 ) , did not show a beneficial effect of low-dose ASA on  CRC incidence .  Furthermore , these agents are not without harms . Clinical ly  significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage  can occur with all of these agents , although it is substantially lower with COX-2 inhibitors . More recently , interest has focused on a  potentially prothrombotic effect  of selective COX-2 inhibitors and  nonnaproxen NSAIDs .  In fact , during the conduct of our systematic review , 2 COX-2 inhibitors ( rofecoxib and valdecoxib ) were withdrawn from the U.S. market because of concerns about their  cardiovascular toxicity  , leaving only celecoxib remaining and uncertainty about the future of others , such as lumiracoxib and etoricoxib . These developments have result ed in uncertainty about the  safety  of COX-2 inhibitors and non-ASA  NSAIDs  when used long-term , such as in the setting of CRC prevention ( 11 ) . At the request of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and the USPSTF , we conducted a systematic review to ascertain the effectiveness of  non-ASA NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors  in the  chemoprevention of colorectal adenomas , CRC  , and  CRC-related death  in  average- to higher-risk individuals .  We also examined the harms associated with these agents . Methods Data Sources We developed the search strategy in MEDLINE and modified it for other data bases . The search was limited to  English- language reports of human studies .  We search ed the  following data  bases  : MEDLINE ( 1966 to December [ week 4 ] 2006 ) , EMBASE ( 1980 to the 14th week of 2005 publication years 2003 to 2005 ) , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL )  ,  and Cochrane Library Issue 4 , 2004  . Beyond these date s , we surveyed several sources to ascertain additional potentially eligible studies . PubMed Cancer subset was search ed for non- MEDLINE material . Search terms were derived from the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Cancer topic search es for colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps . We derived a comprehensive retrieval strategy from the indexing in MEDLINE and EMBASE , investigator-nominated terms , and previous review s ( 1214 ) . We developed a search strategy in MEDLINE ( 2003 to the third week of December 2006 ) to detect recent systematic review s that appeared to address the harms of  non-ASA NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors .  We implemented a weekly monitoring strategy to detect emerging information on  cardiovascular harms  associated with COX-2 inhibitors . We also monitored the U.S. Food and Drug Administration News Digest and Health Canada 's Health Product Information mailing list for announcements related to COX-2 inhibitors  and cardiovascular harms  ( monitoring date s , 14 January 2005 to 26 May 2005 ) . Beyond these date s , we surveyed several sources to ascertain additional potentially eligible studies . Study Selection Citation records were screened to identify potentially relevant articles and retained records were assessed for relevance to identify articles meeting inclusion criteria . A third screening phase was included to discriminate between the different study design s. At each screening stage , 2 members of the review team selected articles for inclusion after an initial calibration exercise . Conflicts were resolved by consensus . We considered r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) ; controlled , clinical trials ; and observational studies ( cohort and casecontrol studies ) of the efficacy of  non-ASA NSAIDs and COX-2   inhibitors for inclusion if they fulfilled the population and outcome criteria . We considered studies for inclusion if participants were at average risk for CRC ( that is  ,  no known risk factors for colorectal adenoma or CRC , other than age ) .  We also considered  studies  of  higher-risk individuals with a personal or family history of colorectal adenoma or a family history of sporadic CRC .  Included studies addressed the incidence of  colorectal adenomas , CRC  , or  both  and  CRC-related death or overall death .  We excluded  studies  of  high-risk patients with familial adenomatous polyposis or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndromes ( Lynch I or II ) and secondary prevention studies of patients with a personal history of CRC .  We sought existing systematic review s to address the  gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , and renal harms  associated with the use of  non-ASA NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors  considering the number of review s already done on these topics . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Several members of the team extracted data independently by using a Web-based system ( SRS 4.0 , TrialStat Corp. , Ottawa , Ontario , Canada ) . We extracted data by using the PICOS ( participant , intervention and exposure , comparator , outcome , and study design ) approach . We used predefined criteria from the USPSTF to assess the quality of included systematic review s , clinical trials , and observational studies , which we rated as good , fair , or poor ( 11 ) . This scale relies on 4 , 6 , 7 , and 7 criteria for systematic review s , casecontrol studies , cohort studies , and RCTs , respectively . A good rating was given when all criteria were met ; a fair rating when at least 80 % were met and the study had no fatal flaws ; and a poor rating when less than 80 % of the criteria were met , when there was a fatal flaw , or both . Data Synthesis and Analysis We used an analytical framework to facilitate study grouping and subsequent data analysis in an effort to minimize clinical heterogeneity . We initially grouped studies by  disorder  ( that is ,  colorectal adenoma or CRC )  ,  study design  ,  study  population , and medication exposure and subsequently subcategorized studies based on  measures of dose effect , duration of exposure , and secondary outcomes  ( when reported ) . Definition of categories , such as regular use , can be found elsewhere ( 11 ) . We summarized and presented harms data from the included systematic review s as a qualitative synthesis . We combined results numerically only if clinical ly and statistically appropriate . We chose  relative risk  as the effect measure . In casecontrol studies , a direct estimate of the relative risk is not possible . However , when event rates are low , as was the case in our review , the odds ratio provides a close approximation of the relative risk . In what follows , we simply refer to the relative risk . We assessed heterogeneity by using the I2 statistic . We combined studies when I2 was 50 % or less ( 15 ) . We directly abstract ed point estimates of the adjusted relative risks and their 95 % CIs from the reports of primary studies . One source of heterogeneity may be study -to- study variation in the method of selecting confounders for which to adjust and the final set of confounders chosen . In Appendix Tables 1 and 2 , we summarize these characteristics for each study . Further , a detailed discussion of the method ological considerations is presented in the USPSTF report ( 11 ) . We computed st and ard errors by dividing the CI width by 21.96 . We conducted quantitative synthesis by using inverse variance weighting and a r and om-effects model ( 17 ) . Appendix Table 1 .

Confounders Addressed in  Adjusted Relative Risks  among the  Included CaseControl Studies :  Duration of  Nonaspirin Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug  ( NSAID  )  Use and the  Risk for Adenomas  * Role of the Funding Sources The evidence synthesis on which this article was based was funded by the CDC , the Agency for Health Research and Quality , and the USPSTF . Its design , conduct , and reporting was based on specific directives from these agencies . Results Study Selection Our literature search yielded  1790 potentially relevant bibliographic records  that addressed the use of ASA , COX-2 inhibitors , and other non-ASA NSAIDs ( 11 ) . For non-ASA NSAIDS , we retrieved  364 articles for relevance  assessment , and  29 studies  met final inclusion criteria . One study of  rofecoxib  ( 18 ) and 2 studies of  celecoxib  ( 19 , 20 ) were published after completion of the task force report ( 11 ) and we include them herein . A  CRC-related death  in 1 cohort study ( 21 ) was reported . The  chemoprophylaxis of CRC  was addressed in 10 casecontrol studies ( 2231 ) and 3 cohort studies ( 3234 ) . The  chemoprophylaxis of colorectal adenoma  was addressed in 10 casecontrol studies ( 31 , 3543 ) , 1 cohort study ( 44 ) , and."
"yPatient  navigation ( PN ) and patient activation ( PA ) interventions  are widely used to help  patients with cancer  to manage the disease and the care trajectory . However , the  usability and impact  of these interventions on  older patients  and their well-being are unclear . This study aims to show which  PN and PA interventions  are being used and what impact they have . After systematic ally search ing the literature , we assessed the quality of the publications we found . The publications had to involve at least a  subgroup of older people with minimally one abnormal oncologic test result each  , and they had to focus on  PN or PA interventions .  Six PA publications examined the interventions exclusively for  elderly patients .  Each of the 11  PN and PA  publications contained at least one comment about the impact on older patients . The  types of impact  varied substantially , but there was scant attention to the  quality of life .  The  type of intervention , the outcome measures and the quality of publications  also varied considerably . Generally , age is not an important factor in  PN and PA  studies . To facilitate adjustment of  navigation and activation interventions  to the individual patient , more rigorous research into the impact of  PN and PA interventions  on  older patients  is necessary."

" There was very low quality of evidence of the short-term effects of  manual acupressure  as an adjuvant intervention for  fatigue , depression , sleep disturbance and uraemic pruritus  in  patients undergoing regular haemodialysis .  The paucity of evidence indicates that there is little evidence of the effects of other types of  acupuncture  for other outcomes , including  pain  , in  patients  with other  stages of CKD  . Overall high or unclear risk of bias distorts the validity of the reported benefit of acupuncture and makes the estimated effects uncertain . The incomplete reporting of acupuncture-related harm does not permit us to assess the safety of acupuncture and related interventions . Future studies should investigate the effects and safety of  acupuncture  for pain and other common symptoms in patients with CKD and those undergoing dialysis."
"CINTRODUCTION The  survival effectiveness  of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  in  non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC )  is still unclear based on the study of most up-to- date literature s. This article contributes to this problem by conducting an up date d meta- analysis . METHODS Based on Burdett et al 's ( J Thorac Oncol 2006;1:611 - 621 ) systematic review , this meta- analysis was conducted . Articles were search ed electrically . The possible survival benefit of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  was assessed by hazard ratio ( HR ) in terms of overall survival . A subgroup meta- analysis with  only stage III NSCLC  was also conducted . The software of Review Manager was used for data management . RESULTS Thirteen r and omized control trials , 6 of which were new ones , were included into this meta- analysis . The  overall survival  of  NSCLC patients  in  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  arm were improved significantly , comparing with those in  surgery-alone  arm ( combined HR = 0.84 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.77 - 0.92 ; p = 0.0001 ) . When only  patients with stage III NSCLC  were considered , the result was similar ( combined HR = 0.84 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.75 - 0.95 ; p = 0.005 ) .   Neoadjuvant chemotherapy  , as an addition of  surgery  , would significantly improve the  overall survival  of operable NSCLC patients , including patients with stage III NSCLC."
"eThe objective of this study is to highlight the importance of anatomical and not-anatomical factors ’ identification for customized therapy in  OSAHS patients .  The data sources are : MEDLINE , The Cochrane Library and EMBASE . A systematic review was performed to identify studies that analyze the role of multiple interacting factors involved in the OSAHS pathophysiology .  85 out of 1242 abstract s  were selected for full-text review . A variable combinations pathophysiological factors contribute to realize differentiated OSAHS phenotypes : a small pharyngeal airway with a low resistance to collapse ( increased critical closing pressure ) , an inadequate responses of pharyngeal dilator muscles ( wakefulness drive to breathe ) , an unstable ventilator responsiveness to hypercapnia ( high loop gain ) , and an increased propensity to wake related to upper airway obstruction ( low arousal threshold ) . Identifying if the anatomical or not-anatomical factors are predominant in each  OSAHS patient  represents the current challenge in clinical practice , moreover for the treatment decision-making . In the future , if a reliable and accurate pathophysiological pattern for each  OSAHS  patient can be identified , a customized therapy will be feasible , with a significant  improvement of surgical success in  sleep surgery and a better underst and ing of surgical failure."
" There is a growing body of evidence from biological , observational and epidemiological studies that suggests a protective effect of  omega 3 PUFA  against  dementia .  However , until data from r and omized trials become available for analysis , there is no good evidence to support the use of dietary or supplemental  omega 3 PUFA  for the prevention of cognitive impairment or dementia."
" In  adult asthmatics  , there was no significant difference between the  combination of LABA and ICS  and a higher dose  of ICS  for the prevention of  exacerbations  requiring systemic  corticosteroids  . Overall , the combination therapy led to greater  improvement in lung function , symptoms and use of rescue beta2 agonists  , ( although most of the results are from trials of up to 24 weeks duration ) . There were less withdrawals due to poor asthma control in this group than when using a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids . Apart from an  increased rate of tremor  , the two options appear safe although adverse effects associated with long-term ICS treatment were seldom monitored."
"eAIMS AND OBJECTIVES This review aims to summarise and evaluate  multicomponent interventions  focused on improving the  competence  of  family members of people with dementia ( PwD ) who undertake the caregiving tasks .  BACKGROUND Caregiver  competence  is essential for  family members of PwD acting as caregivers .  Competence affects the physical and mental health of both  PwD and caregivers .  Many kinds of  multicomponent interventions  are used to improve  caregiver competence .  DESIGN A systematic review . METHODS A literature search from  six data bases  was conducted .  Articles published until January 2017 were  screened . Intervention studies that measured  caregiver competence of  family members of PwD  as an  outcome were included . The Oxford Center Evidence -based Medicine criteria and the Cochrane H and book for Systematic Review s of Interventions were used for quality assessment . RESULTS  Fifteen studies were included , and number of participants was 1096 .  The characteristics of the included studies and key findings were analysed .  Multicomponent interventions  may improve the  family caregivers ' competence .  Caregivers in the intervention group were confident and skilful in managing their role .  The intervention design , treatment content and length and intensity of the intervention varied in the included studies . Given that heterogeneity was high , combining these results via narrative synthesis is more appropriate than a meta- analysis . The current study provides recommendations regarding the formulation and implementation of interventions based on relevant literature . In view of existing research , research ers should conduct an in-depth study in this area and provide evidence -based interventions to support family members caring for PwD. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The competence of family caregivers is essential for the life quality of PwD. To promote the health of the family caregiver and PwD ,  multicomponent interventions  may be appropriate for nurses to practice."

"eC onsider  an adult with the following characteristics .  To which disease severity would you assign this patient ’s asthma ? •   Forced  expiratory volume in 1 second (  FEV1  ) or  peak expiratory flow  ( PEF ) ≥80  %  •  PEF  variability 20%–30 %  •  Daytime symptoms  less than once  a  day  • Nighttime symptoms  more than 1 night a week . This patient is said to have moderate persistent asthma based on nighttime symptoms . An accurate classification of a patient ’s asthma is the foundation for selecting an appropriate treatment strategy . In 2002 the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) up date d select topics from its 1997 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma . These evidence -based revisions to the stepwise approach to asthma management were made following a systematic review of the literature ( see Search function ) . This article review s the 2002 NAEPP recommendations for the use of controller  medications  for  asthma  ,  including : • Relative effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids ( ICSs ) versus other controller medications • Safety of long-term ICS use in children • Potential benefits of early ICS treatment  .

" In appropriate  patients with gallbladder cancer or cholangiocarcinoma  , surgery offers the best chance for survival and should remain the first treatment of choice . For patients not considered c and i date s for surgery , but willing and able to tolerate  chemotherapy  alone or in combination with a  fluoropyrimidine (  such  as 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine ) , gemcitabine  appears to be a reasonable alternative to best supportive care , although this conclusion has not been confirmed with a r and omized controlled trial."
"0Shockwave  therapy ( SWT )  is a commonly used intervention for a number of musculoskeletal conditions with varying clinical outcomes . However , the capacity of  SWT  to influence pathophysiological processes and the morphology of affected tissues remains unclear . The objective of the current review is to evaluate changes in  imaging outcomes  of musculoskeletal conditions following  SWT .  A comprehensive search of Medline , Embase , Cochrane Controlled Trials Register , CINAHL and SportD iscus was conducted from inception to October 2018 . Prospect i ve clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of  SWT  based on changes in imaging outcomes were eligible for inclusion . Articles were evaluated independently for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias list and the Method ological Index for Non-R and omized Studies . R and om-effects meta- analysis and meta-regression with a priori determined covariates was conducted for each condition to determine potential predictors of  SWT  effects .  Sixty-three studies were included , with data from 27 studies available  for  effect  size pooling . Meta-analyses and meta-regression on imaging outcomes were performed for rotator cuff calcific tendinitis ( n = 11 ) , plantar fasciitis ( n = 7 ) and osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( n = 9 ) . There was an overall  reduction  in  the size of measured lesion  following  SWT  ( MD 8.44 mm ( 95%CI 4.30 , 12.57 ) , p < 0.001 ) for  calcium deposit diameter  , ( MD 0.92 mm ( 95%CI 0.03 , 1.81 ) , p = 0.04 ) for  plantar fascia thickness  and ( MD 4.84 % ( 95%CI -0.06 , 9.75 ) , p = 0.05 ) for  lesion size in femoral head osteonecrosis .  Meta-regression showed no influence of   SWT  dosage parameters  , however ,  baseline lesion size  was an independent predictor for changes in  imaging outcomes  .  SWT  altered the  morphology of musculoskeletal conditions  , potentially reflecting changes in underlying pathophysiological processes . The parameters of  SWT  dosage are not significant predictors of changes in  imaging outcomes  . Lack of adequate reporting of imaging outcomes limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the current review . Registration number : PROSPERO CRD42018091140."

"tThis systematic review examines the characteristics and psychometric properties of the instruments used to assess  self-care behaviors  among  persons with type 2 diabetes .  Electronic data bases were search ed for relevant studies published in English within the past 20 years . Thirty different instruments were identified in  75  articles  :  18 original instruments on  type 2 diabetes  mellitus self-care , 8 translated or revised version , and 4 not specific but relevant to diabetes . Twenty-one instruments were multidimensional and addressed  multiple dimensions of self-care behavior .  Nine were unidimensional : three focusing exclusively on  medication taking  , three on  diet  , one on  physical activity  , one on  self-monitoring of blood glucose  , and one on  oral  care  .  Most instruments ( 22 of 30 ) were developed during the last decade . Only 10 were repeated more than once . Nineteen of the 30 instruments reported both  reliability and validity information  but with varying degrees of rigor . In conclusion , most instruments used to measure  self-care  were relatively new and had been applied to only a limited number of studies with incomplete psychometric profiles . Rigorous psychometric testing , operational definition of self-care , and sufficient explanation of scoring need to be considered for further instrument development."

"eThe present study aim ed to evaluate evidence on  metabolisable  energy  consumption  and  pattern of consumption  with age in  infants in the developed world who were exclusively  breast-fed  , at around the time of introducing  complementary feeding .   We carried out a systematic review aim ed at answering three questions : how much milk is transferred from mother to infant ? ; does transfer increase with the age of the infant ? ; and what is the metabolisable  energy  content of breast milk ?  Thirty-three eligible studies of 1041 mother -- infant pairs  reported transfer at 3 - -4 months of age , the weighted mean transfer being 779 ( SD 40 ) g/d . Six studies ( 99 pairs ) measured  transfer  at 5 months , with a weighted mean transfer of 827 ( SD 39 ) g/d . Five studies ( 72 pairs ) measured  milk transfer  at 6 months , reporting a weighted mean transfer of 894 ( SD 87 ) g/d . Nine longitudinal studies reported no significant increases in  milk transfer  after 2 - -4 months . Twenty-five studies on  breast-milk energy content  were based on  777 mother -- infant pairs .  The  weighted mean metabolisable energy content  was 2.6 ( SD 0.2 ) kJ/g .  Breast-milk metabolisable energy content  is probably lower , and  breast-milk transfer  slightly higher , than is usually assumed . Longitudinal studies do not support the hypothesis that  breast-milk transfer  increases markedly with age . More research on energy intake in  5 - -6-month-old exclusively breast-fed infants  is necessary , and information on the metabolisability of breast milk in mid-infancy is desirable . This evidence should inform future recommendations on infant feeding and help to identify research needs in infant energy balance."

"3Human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients  are at risk for renal disease as a consequence of complications of antiretroviral treatment . Particularly , the complication of kidney disease is high in  patients who switched to  Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate .   The treatment is associated with nephrotoxicity , decrease in glomerular filtration rate , leading to kidney disease . This review focused on assessing the effect of  antiretroviral therapy ( ART )  on kidney function among  HIV-positive patients .  Initially , the study protocol was registered on Prospero and given a unique identification number of CRD42018087686 . We then conducted a systematic search of PubMed , Google Scholar , the Cochrane library , and Google from 2008 to September 2018 . We found  742 study results eligible for this review .  After stringent filtration mechanism , 15 qualified studies were used for systematic review and meta- analysis process . Cross-sectional , cohort , r and omized controlled trials , and prospect i ve studies were eligible for inclusion in the study . The  overall pooled prevalence  found in this meta- analysis was 6.42 % with high statistical heterogeneity ( I2 = 96.7 % ) . The  highest subgroup prevalence  was reported from  Ghana  , with subgroup prevalence of 13.65 % without statistical heterogeneity ( I2 = 0.0 % ) . Majority of  chronic kidney disease (  CKD ) was in stage 3 with subgroup prevalence of 6.78 % and tolerable statistical heterogeneity ( I2 = 66.7 % ) .

" Moderate- quality evidence from 26 studies showed that inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists are  effective  over the medium and long term for  patients with moderate to severe COPD  . Their use is associated with  improved quality of life  and  reduced exacerbations  , including those requiring hospitalisation . Overall , findings showed that inhaled LABAs did not significantly reduce mortality or serious adverse events."
")While various approaches have been proposed in clinical trials aim ed at improving motor  function   after spinal cord injury in humans  , there is still limited information regarding the scope , method ological quality , and evidence associated with  single-intervention and multi-intervention  approaches  .  A systematic review performed using the PubMed search engine and the key words "" spinal cord injury motor  recovery ""  identified  1973 records , of which 39 were selected ( 18 from the search records and 21 from reference list inspection ) .  Study phase ( clinical trials.org criteria ) and method ological quality ( Cochrane criteria ) were assessed . Studies included proposed a broad range of  single-intervention (  encompassing  cell therapies , pharmacology , electrical stimulation , rehabilitation )  ( encompassing  cell therapies , pharmacology , electrical stimulation , rehabilitation )  and  multi-intervention approaches (  that combined  more than one strategy  ) . The highest evidence level was for Phase III studies supporting the role of  multi-intervention approaches  that contained a rehabilitation component . Quality appraisal revealed that the percentage of selected studies classified with high risk of bias by Cochrane criteria was as follows : r and om sequence generation = 64 % ; allocation concealment = 77 % ; blinding of participants and personnel = 69 % ; blinding of outcome assessment = 64 % ; attrition = 44 % ; selective reporting = 44 % . The current literature contains a high proportion of studies with a limited ability to measure efficacy in a valid manner because of low method ological strength in all items of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment . Recommendations to decrease bias are discussed and include increased method ological rigor in the study design and recruitment of study participants , and the use of electrophysiological and imaging measures that can assess functional integrity of the spinal cord ( and may be sufficiently sensitive to detect changes that occur in response to therapeutic interventions )."
"nPolycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a common disease that has an effect on approximately 10 % of women of childbearing  age  . Although there is evidence regarding the role of lifestyle factors in the development of PCOS , the exact etiology remains unclear . Additionally ,  metformin  is used in the treatment of PCOS but its role remains unclear . We compared the effects of  lifestyle modification ( LSM ) + metformin and metformin alone  on PCOS . We performed a systematic review by search ing electronic data bases for publications until December 2019 . The primary endpoints were  clinical outcomes , such as menstrual cycles and pregnancy rates  , and the secondary endpoints  were anthropometric , metabolic , and and rogenic parameters .  The meta- analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the improvements  in the menstrual cycles  between  LSM and metformin  alone ( weighted mean difference [ MD ] = 1.62 ) and between  LSM + metformin and LSM  ( MD = 1.20 ) .  The pregnancy rates and body mass indices  were not significantly different between  LSM and metformin  alone ( MD = 1.44 and −0.11 , respectively ) .  LSM   reduced insulin resistance  ( MD = −0.52 )  and increased serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulins  ( MD = 8.27 ) compared  with metformin  . Therefore , we suggest recommending lifestyle modifications actively to  women with PCOS  if they do not have indications for metformin."
"sObjective : A systematic review and meta- analysis was conducted to illustrate whether  people with multiple sclerosis  engage in more physical activity following  behaviour change interventions .  Data re sources : MEDLINE , CINAHL , PubMed , Web of Sciences , Cochrane Library , SCOPUS , EMBASE and PEDro were search ed from their inception till 30 April 2015 . Trial selection : R and omized and clinical controlled trials that used  behaviour change interventions  to increase physical activity in  people with multiple sclerosis were selected  ,  regardless of type or duration of multiple sclerosis or disability severity .  Data extraction : Data extraction was conducted by two independent review ers and the Cochrane Collaboration ’s recommended method was used to assess the risk of bias of each included study . Results :  A total of 19 out of 573 studies were included .  Focusing on trials without risk of bias , meta- analysis showed that  behaviour change interventions  can significantly  increase physical activity participation  ( z = 2.20 , p = 0.03 , st and ardised main difference 0.65 , 95 % confidence interval 0.07 to 1.22 , 3 trials , I2 = 68 % ) ( eight to 12 weeks ’ duration ) .  Behaviour change interventions  did  not significantly impact  on  the physical components of quality of life or fatigue .  Conclusion :  Behaviour change interventions  provided for relatively short duration ( eight to 12 weeks ) may  increase the amount of physical activity   people with multiple sclerosis  engage in , but appear to have no effect on the  physical components of quality of life and fatigue .  Further high quality investigations of the efficacy of  behaviour change interventions  to increase  physical activity participation  that focus on dose , long-term impact and method of delivery are warranted for people with multiple sclerosis."

"sAnatomy knowledge has been found to include both spatial and non-spatial components . However , no systematic evaluation of studies relating spatial abilities and anatomy knowledge has been undertaken . The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the relationship between  spatial abilities test  and   anatomy knowledge assessment  .  A literature search was done up to March 20 , 2014 in Scopus and in several data bases on the OvidSP and EBSCOhost platforms . Of the  556 citations obtained , 38 articles were identified and fully review ed yielding 21 eligible articles  and their quality were formally assessed . Non-significant relationships were found between  spatial abilities test and anatomy knowledge assessment  using essays and non-spatial multiple-choice questions . Significant relationships were observed between  spatial abilities test  and  anatomy knowledge assessment  using practical examination , three-dimensional synthesis from two-dimensional views , drawing of views , and cross-sections .

"hEpidemiological studies first demonstrated the association between  obesity and asthma  and they have begun to provide additional evidence to support causality : a dose-effect relationship , consistency across studies ( especially among women ) and the correct temporal order ( ie , obesity before asthma ) . To date , relatively few studies have addressed reversibility , an important but less frequently demonstrated epidemiological criterion of causality . Reversibility suggests that if excessive weight is a risk factor for asthma , then reducing body weight should decrease the prevalence of asthma , or at least decrease  asthma related symptoms  or health care utilisation . We performed a systematic  review  on  weight loss  and asthma , based on search es between January 1966 and January 2007 of both PubMed and the Cochrane Clinical Trial Data base . Of the  15 relevant studies  ,   asthma   was the primary  outcome in only five .  Only one study was conducted  in children .  Regardless of the type of intervention ( surgical vs medical ) , all 15 studies noted an improvement in at least one  asthma outcome after weight loss .  The improvement was noted across studies that differed in sample age , gender or country of origin . The heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes precluded quantitative synthesis . We briefly review the role of specific factors ( eg , gastro-oesophageal reflux ) in the  weight loss-asthma  association , and potential directions for future research."
"dIMPORTANCE Human serum bactericidal antibody levels ( hSBA ) are commonly used as an immune correlate of protection after vaccination against  meningococcal disease  . We performed a systematic review of how well this marker correlates with protection induced by  outer membrane vesicle ( OMV ) vaccines  against  meningococcal B ( MenB ) disease  . OBJECTIVE To compare  vaccine effectiveness ( VE )  of  OMV vaccines  against MenB predicted by hSBA ( predicted protection ) to VE from clinical studies ( observed protection ) . DATA SOURCES Studies identified by search ing Medline , Embase , Global Health , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s and Data base of Abstract s of Review s of Effects . STUDY SELECTION Studies reporting hSBA after vaccination with  OMV vaccines  and subsequent efficacy/effectiveness in a  MenB  outbreak were included . DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction and risk of bias assessment s were performed by two independent investigators . MAIN OUTCOMES AND  MEASURES Predicted VE and observed VE measured during MenB outbreaks .  RESULTS We included  19 studies ( eleven r and omized controlled trials , six cohort studies , two case-control studies ) .  Four different  OMV vaccines  were applied during nine different outbreaks ( six countries , 1987 - 2009 ) . A comparison between predicted and observed  VE  was possible using results from studies performed during five outbreaks . Predicted  VE  differed from observed VE by 2 - 59 % , with greater differences observed in younger  age groups  . In general , predicted VE tended to be lower than observed VE .  AND RELEVANCE : hSBA induced by  OMV vaccines  correlates moderately well with protection against  MenB in older children and adults .  The correlation was poor at very young ages , for which low VE was observed."
"eAs a  treatment summary ( TS  ) documents information for follow-up care , it is believed to be an important communication tool for the patient , their GP , and other health professionals . The aim of this systematic review ( SR ) was to evaluate the impact of receiving a  TS  for  cancer survivors  when compared to  receiving st and ard care  and to identify knowledge gaps to inform future research . A systematic search of electronic data bases and grey literature was undertaken from August 2018 to October 2018 .  Studies were included if participants ( cancer survivors ) were over 18 years of age and had received a  TS  , and if outcomes for   TS   could  be separated from other survivorship interventions . The McMaster Critical Appraisal Tool was used to evaluate the method ological quality of the included studies . A narrative synthesis of the study outcomes was then conducted .  Seven studies (  one  prospect  i ve cohort  and  six cross-sectional  studies )  met the inclusion criteria . The  impact  of   TS   was assessed using widely varied outcomes in these studies . Overall , receipt of a  TS  was related to  greater patient underst and ing and perception of the quality of care provided .  However , caution is required when interpreting these results due to method ological limitations . This systematic review found that  TS  may have a  positive impact on patient underst and ings  about  and perceptions of cancer  care . However , more robust research including perspectives of cancer survivors is required .  TS  could play an important role for  cancer  survivors especially in terms of knowledge of cancer care."

"sBackground :  Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs )  are increasingly being used in the treatment of a wide variety of sports-related conditions . Despite this enthusiasm , the biological properties of MSCs and their effects on  musculoskeletal tissue healing  remain poorly understood .  MSC-based  strategies encompass cell population s with heterogeneous phenotypes isolated from multiple tissues and using different methods . Therefore , comprehensive reporting of the source , preparation methods , and characteristics of MSC strategies is essential to enable interpretation of results . Purpose : To perform a systematic review of levels of reporting of key variables in MSC preparation and composition for clinical studies evaluating  MSC-based therapies  in the treatment of  musculoskeletal conditions .  Study Design : Systematic review . Methods : A systematic review of the  clinical orthopaedic and sports medicine literature from 2002 to 2017  was performed . The following inclusion criteria were used :  human clinical trials  ,  published in the English language  , involving the administration of   MSC-based  therapies  for  orthopaedic or sports medicine applications .  In vitro or ex vivo studies , editorials , letters to the editor , and studies relating to cosmetic , neurological , or dental applications were excluded . Results : Of the  1259 studies identified on the initial search , 36 studies were found to satisfy the inclusion criteria  for analysis on comprehensive review . Fifty-seven percent of studies evaluated bone marrow – derived MSCs , 41 % evaluated adipose-derived MSCs , and 2 % evaluated synovium-derived MSCs . Considerable deficiencies in the reporting of key variables , including the details of  stem  cell  processing ,  culture  conditions  , and the characteristics of cell population s delivered , were noted . Overall , studies reported only 52 % ( range , 30%-80 % ) of variables that may critically influence outcome . No study provided adequate information relating to all of these variables . Conclusion : All existing clinical studies evaluating MSCs for orthopaedic or sports medicine applications are limited by inadequate reporting of both preparation protocol s and composition . Deficient reporting of the variables that may critically influence outcome precludes interpretation , prevents others from reproducing experimental conditions , and makes comparisons across studies difficult . We encourage the adoption of emerging minimum reporting st and ards for clinical studies evaluating the use of  MSCs  in orthopaedics."

"sBackground R and omised trials comparing different drugs head-to-head are extremely valuable for clinical decision-making . However , it is scientifically and ethically sensible to dem and strong evidence that a drug is effective by showing superiority over a placebo before embarking on head-to-head comparisons of potentially ineffective drugs . Our aim was to study the evolvement of evidence from  placebo-controlled  and head-to-head trials on the effects of  antibiotics  for the treatment of  mild to moderate exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .  Methods We conducted a historical systematic review . Through electronic data bases and h and - search es , we identified   placebo-controlled and head-to-head antibiotic  trials  for the  treatment  of  mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations .  We  compared the numbers of patients recruited in  placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials  between 1957 and 2005 .  Using cumulative meta- analysis of placebo-controlled trials , we determined when , if ever , placebo-controlled trials had shown convincing evidence that antibiotics are effective in preventing  treatment failure  in  patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations .  Results The first head-to-head trial was published in 1963 . It was followed by another 100 trials comparing different antibiotics in  a total of 34,029 patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations .  Over time , the  cumulative odds ratio  in  placebo-controlled  trials remained inconclusive throughout with odds  ratios  ranging from 0.39 ( 95 % confidence intervals 0.04–4.22 ) to the most recent estimate ( 1995 ) of 0.81 ( 95 % confidence intervals 0.52–1.28 , P = 0.37 ) . Conclusion Placebo-controlled trials do not support the use of antibiotics in  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with mild to moderate exacerbations .  Conducting head-to-head trials is , therefore , scientifically and ethically question able . This underscores the requirement to perform or study systematic review s of placebo-controlled trials before conducting head-to-head trials."
"eAIMS To measure the prevalence of  beta-blocker eye  drop prescribing and respiratory effect of  ocular beta-blocker administration  in  people with asthma .  METHODS We measured the prevalence  of  ocular beta-blocker prescribing  in people with asthma and ocular hypertension  , and performed a nested case-control study ( NCCS ) measuring risk of moderate exacerbations ( rescue steroids in primary care ) and severe exacerbations ( asthma hospitalization ) using linked data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Data link . We then performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of clinical trials evaluating changes in lung function following  ocular beta-blocker administration  in  people with asthma .  RESULTS From 2000 to 2012 , the prevalence of  non-selective  and  selective  beta-blocker  eye drop prescribing in people with asthma and ocular hypertension  fell from 23.0 % to 13.4 % and from 10.5 % to 0.9 % respectively . In the NCCS ,  the relative incidence ( IRR ) of moderate exacerbations  increased significantly with acute non-selective beta-blocker eye drop exposure ( IRR 4.83 , 95 % CI 1.56 - 14.94 ) but not with chronic exposure . In the meta- analysis , acute non-selective beta-blocker eye drop exposure caused  significant mean falls in FEV1  of -10.9 % ( 95 % CI -14.9 to -6.9 ) ,  and falls in FEV1  of ≥20 % affecting one in three . Corresponding values for selective beta-blockers in people sensitive to ocular non-selective beta-blockers was -6.3 % ( 95 % CI -11.7 to -0.8 ) , and a non-significant  increase in falls in  FEV1 of ≥20 % .   Non-selective  beta-blocker eye drops significantly  affect lung function  and  increase asthma  morbidity but are still frequently prescribed to  people with asthma  and ocular hypertension despite safer agents being available."

" The five studies provided useful and credible findings from  caregivers '  voices that are not often heard in regard to the meaning of participating in support groups . Peer support is beneficial for caregivers , and it provides a source of positive emotional support and a means of venting  negative feeling  and gaining help to address issues in the everyday life of caring for older adults with dementia."
" There was no significant difference in  effectiveness and risks  between the therapy groups . However , these outcomes should be interpreted with caution . Specific categories of combination therapy and periodic medication should be paid more attention in future studies."
"gThis evidence review aim ed to conceptualize  patient satisfaction  with   anesthesia  care  ( PSAC ) , which has been linked to reimbursement , competency evaluations , and litigation ; to describe factors affecting PSAC ; and to develop provider recommendations to enhance PSAC . The search for systematic review s , survey reports , qualitative studies , and consumer satisfaction reports within the last 20 years excluded  pediatric and obstetric articles .  The search yielded  27 quantitative , 7 qualitative , and 9 consumer satisfaction articles .  High levels of PSAC are reported using a variety of methods . Studies evaluating patient perioperative experiences document that  fear  and anxiety with prior patient experiences have an impact on anticipatory anxiety . Patients reported desiring positive experiences and emotional connections with anesthesia providers . Modifiable dissatisfiers included  anxiety , inadequate explanation of anesthesia , postoperative pain and nausea or vomiting , long surgeries or wait times , and anesthesia complications .  Besides providing preoperative information with reasonable expectations ( eg , for nausea and vomiting ) and treating discomfort , anesthetists must engage emotionally with patients . Measures of PSAC should include the emotional component of PSAC . Future research addressing patient experiences with differing anesthesia methods would be helpful for providers trying to underst and and facilitate patient coping."
"rBreast cancer is the most prevalent oncological disease among women , and it represents the second oncological cause of death . Many studies have considered the  quality of life  in  people with breast cancer  because this condition has high comorbidity with mental distress , anxiety , affective disorders and depression .  Psychological interventions  can reduce the stressful consequences of both the diagnosis and the medical treatments of breast cancer . However , different methods ( e.g. ,  group or individual therapy )  and focus ( e.g. , improving  personal skills  or  increasing emotional well-being  ) do not help to identify which type of  psychological therapy  can be more effective in improving  quality of life  in  patients  with breast cancer  .  This study was aim ed to systematic ally review and compare , by means of a meta- analysis , the efficacy of  cognitive behavioural , supportive-expressive or psycho-educational treatments  in  women with breast cancer  , focusing on  anxiety , depression , mood and quality of life  as outcomes . The PRISMA statement was adopted . MEDLINE , PsycINFO , PUBMED and PsycArticles data bases were used , and reference lists were examined for additional publications . In the selection of the articles were included studies  considering women between 18 and 65 years who were diagnosed with breast cancer at any stage and under any treatment , and who underwent  psychological group interventions .   At the end of the systematic review ,  45 studies met all inclusion criteria  and were analysed in the meta- analysis . The  overall effect size  was medium , especially considering  cognitive behavioural therapy and psycho-educational treatments .  However , the studies are characterised by high method ological heterogeneity . Despite some limitations , this review and meta- analysis partially confirm the efficiency of  cognitive-behavioural and psycho-educational therapies  in the improvement of  well-being  in women with breast cancer."
"eThe present paper systematic ally review s studies examining the potential beneficial or  harmful  effects of  religious/spiritual coping  with  cancer .  Using  religion  and  spirituality  as re sources in coping may be specifically prevalent in  patients with cancer  considering the potentially life-threatening nature of the illness .  Religious/spiritual coping  may also serve multiple functions in long-term adjustment to cancer such as maintaining  self-esteem  , providing  a sense of meaning and purpose  , giving  emotional comfort  and providing a  sense of hope .   Seventeen papers met the inclusion criteria  of which seven found some evidence for the beneficial effect of  religious coping  , but one of these also found religious  coping  to be detrimental in a sub- sample of their population . A further three studies found religious  coping  to be  harmful  and seven found  non-significant results .  However , many studies suffered from serious method ological problems , especially in the manner in which religious coping was conceptualised and measured . The studies also failed to control for possible influential variables such as  stage of illness and perceived social support .  Due to this , any firm conclusions about the possible  beneficial or harmful effects  of  religious coping  with cancer is lacking . These problems are discussed and suggestions for future studies are made."

"sBACKGROUND Permanent compliance of self-care behaviors is a challenging issue in managing  chronic diseases like diabetes .  The evidence supports  theory-based intervention  in  promoting self-care behaviors .  However , no systematic review was done to monitor these interventions and compare more effective constructs . This study was conducted to investigate the studies using  self-care theories  and introducing the  most effective theories .  METHODS This is a systematic review study during which some scientific data bases including Scopus , Elsevier , Google scholar and PubMed were search ed by using some key words like  self-care or self-management  , diabetes , theory or  model .   English articles from the start of 2013 up to the end of November 2020 were monitored  . RESULTS  20 articles were selected  and studied based on eight theories which they used . These theories were :   Social support theory , Health Belief Model , Heath Belief Model and Empowerment Theory , Empowerment Theory , Self-efficacy Theory , precede-proceed model , Self-regulation Theory , behavioral theory  and  Social Cognitive Theory .    Four theories appeared to be more  effective  for the target behavior of present research :  Social Support  Theory and the combination of Empowerment Theory and Health Belief Model , Social Cognitive Theory and  Self Efficacy  Theory . Taken together , the findings of this systematic review suggest that interventions that go beyond individual determinants ( such as changing  knowledge  and attitudes ) to determinants of upper cognitive , motor , and social levels ( such as the  development of skills and competencies  ) they have led to raised self-care outcomes."
"dCONTEXT  Severe acute malnutrition ( SAM )  accounts for approximately 1 million child deaths per year . High mortality is linked with comorbidities , such as diarrhea and pneumonia . OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review was to determine the extent to which carbohydrate malabsorption occurs in  children with SAM .  DATA SOURCES The PubMed and Embase data bases were search ed . Reference lists of selected articles were checked . DATA EXTRACTION All observational and controlled intervention studies  involving children with SAM in which direct or indirect measures of carbohydrate absorption  were analyzed were eligible for inclusion .  A total of 20 articles were selected  for this review . DATA SYNTHESIS Most studies reported carbohydrate malabsorption , particularly lactose malabsorption , and suggested an increase in  diarrhea and reduced weight gain  in  children on a lactose-containing  diet .   As most studies review ed were observational , there was no conclusive scientific evidence of a causal relationship between  lactose malabsorption  and a worse  clinical outcome  among malnourished children .  The combined data indicate that carbohydrate malabsorption is prevalent in  children with SAM .  Additional well- design ed intervention studies are needed to determine whether outcomes of SAM complicated by carbohydrate malabsorption could be improved by altering the  carbohydrate/lactose  content of  therapeutic feeds  and to eluci date the precise mechanisms involved."
"sWith more vaccines becoming available worldwide , vaccine research is on the rise in  developing countries .  To gain a better underst and ing of safety reporting from vaccine clinical research in  developing countries  , we conducted a systematic review in Medline and Embase ( 1989 - 2011 ) of published  r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs )  reporting safety outcomes with ≥50  % developing country participation  ( PROSPERO systematic review registration number : CRD42012002025 ) .  Developing country vaccine RCTs  were analyzed with respect to the number of participants , age  groups  studied , inclusion of safety information , number of reported adverse events following immunization ( AEFI ) , type and duration of safety follow-up , use of st and ardized AEFI case definitions , grading of AEFI severity , and the reporting of levels of diagnostic certainty for AEFI . The systematic search yielded a total number of  50 r and omized vaccine clinical trials investigating 12 different vaccines , most  commonly rotavirus and malaria vaccines  .  In these trials , 94,459 AEFI were reported from  446,908 participants receiving 735,920 vaccine doses .  All 50 RCTs  mentioned safety outcomes  with 70 % using definitions for at least one AEFI . The most commonly defined AEFI  was fever  ( 27 ) , followed by  local  ( 16 ) and  systemic  reactions ( 14 ) . Logistic regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between the implementation of a  fever case  definition and  the reporting rate for fever  as an AEFI ( p=0.027 ) . Overall , 16 different definitions  for fever  and 7 different  definitions for erythema  were applied . Predefined AEFI case definitions by the Brighton Collaboration were used in only two out of 50 RCTs . The search was limited to RCTs published in English or German and may be missing studies published locally . The reported systematic review suggests room for improvement with respect to the harmonization of safety reporting from developing country vaccine clinical trials and the implementation of st and ardized case definitions."

"DBackground  Mobile health applications  are increasingly used in  patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )  to improve their self-management , nonetheless , without firm evidence of their efficacy . This meta- analysis was aim ed to assess the efficacy of  mobile health applications  in supporting self-management as an intervention to reduce  hospital admission rates and average days of hospitalization  , etc . Methods PubMed , Web of Science ( SCI ) , Cochrane Library , and Embase were search ed for relevant articles published before November 14th , 2017 . A total of  6  reports  with r and omized controlled  trials ( RCTs ) were finally included in this meta- analysis . Results  Patients using  mobile phone applications   may have a  lower risk for hospital admissions  than those in the usual  care  group ( risk ratio ( RR ) = 0.73 , 95 % CI [ 0.52 , 1.04 ] ) . However , there was no significant difference in reducing  the average days of hospitalization .  ConclusionS elf-management  with mobile phone applications  could reduce  hospital admissions  of patients with COPD."
"nBackground  RotaTeq ™  ( RV5 ; Merck & Co. Inc. , USA ) and  Rotarix ™  (  RV1  , GlaxoSmithKline , Belgium )  vaccines  , developed to prevent  rotavirus diarrhea in children under five years old  , were both introduced into national immunization programs in 2006 . As many  countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  have included either  RV5 or RV1  in their routine childhood vaccination programs , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to analyze efficacy , safety and effectiveness data from the region . Methods We conducted a systematic search in PubMed , EMBASE , Scielo , Lilacs and the Cochrane Central Register , for controlled efficacy , safety and effectiveness studies  published between January 2000 until December 2011 , on  RV5 and RV1  across Latin America ( where both vaccines are available since 2006 ) .  The primary outcome measures were  : rotavirus-related gastroenteritis of any severity ; rotavirus emergency department visits and hospitalization ; and severe adverse events  . Results The results of the meta- analysis for efficacy show that RV1 reduced  the risk of any-severity rotavirus-related gastroenteritis  by 65 % ( relative risk ( RR ) 0.35 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.25 ; 0.50 ) , and of  severe gastroenteritis  by 82 % ( RR 0.18 , 95%CI 0.12 ; 0.26 )  versus  placebo . In trials , both vaccines significantly  reduced the risk of hospitalization and emergency visits  by 85 % ( RR 0.15 , 95%CI 0.09 ; 0.25 ) for RV1 and by 90 % ( RR 0.099 , 95%CI 0.012 ; 0.77 ) for RV5 . Vaccination with RV5 or RV1 did not  increase the risk of death , intussusception , or other severe adverse events  which were previously associated with the first licensed rotavirus vaccine . Real-world effectiveness studies showed that both vaccines  reduced rotavirus hospitalization  in the region by around 45–50 % for RV5 ( for 1 to 3 doses , respectively ) , and , by around 50–80 % for RV1 ( for 1 to 2 doses , respectively ) . For RV1  , effectiveness against hospitalization  was highest ( around 80–96 % ) for  children  vaccinated before 12 months of age , compared with 5–60 % effectiveness in older children . Both vaccines were most effective in  preventing more severe gastroenteritis  ( 70 % for RV5 and 80–90 % for RV1  ) and severe gastroenteritis  ( 50 % for RV5 and 70–80 % for RV1 ) . Conclusion This systematic literature review confirms  rotavirus vaccination  has been proven effective and well tolerated in protecting children in Latin America and the Caribbean."
"yPurpose The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of   maternal smoking during pregnancy  (  MSDP )  on the  risk  of  bone fractures  in offspring  through a systematic review and meta- analysis . Methods Electronic data bases including PubMed , Web of Science and Scopus were systematic ally search ed for relevant articles published up to July 2019 . According to heterogeneity the pooled risk ratio ( RR ) and odds ratio ( OR ) and their corresponding 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) were obtained by fixed or r and om effect model . Heterogeneity and quality of included studies were assessed by I-squared ( I2 ) statistic and Newcastle-Ottawa scale , respectively . Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effect of  MSDP  misclassification on the results . Results After review  ing 842 search records , a total of 5 studies including 8746 mother-child pair were included in the meta- analysis .  Pooling adjusted effect measures showed that  MSDP  was not associated with  later risk of bone fractures  in offspring ( pooled RR=1.15 , 95 % CI : 0.84 , 1.58 , I2=66.8 % , P=0.049 ) . After adjusting for misclassification ,  MSDP  may be associated with 27 %  increased risk of bone fracture  ( pooled OR=1.27 , 95 % CI : 1.00 , 1.62 , I2=0 % , P=0.537 ) . Conclusion After adjusting for misclassification , the  MSDP  is associated with the increase  risk of bone fractures  among children whose mother smoke during pregnancy."
" The findings of this review show that currently no evidence suggests that the pharmacological compounds assessed have a deleterious effect on the  severity of OSA  as measured by  change in AHI or ODI .  Significant clinical and statistical decreases in  minimum overnight SpO2  were observed with  remifentanil , zolpidem  20 mg and  triazolam  0.25 mg .  Eszopiclone  3 mg and  sodium oxybate  4.5 g showed a beneficial effect on the  severity of OSA  with a  reduction in AHI  and may merit further assessment as a potential therapeutic option for a subgroup of patients with OSA . Only one trial assessed the effect of an  opioid ( remifentanil ) ;  some studies included CPAP treatment , whilst in a significant number of participants , previous treatment with CPAP was not stated and thus a residual treatment effect of CPAP could not be excluded . Most studies were small and of short duration , with indiscernible method ological quality . Caution is therefore required when such agents are prescribed for  patients  with OSA , especially outside the severity of the OSA cohorts and the corresponding dose of compounds given in the particular studies . Larger , longer trials involving patients across a broader spectrum of OSA severity are needed to clarify these results."
"eThere is an increasing interest in the potential of exhaled biomarkers , such as  volatile organic compounds  ( VOCs ) , to improve accurate diagnoses and management decisions in  pulmonary diseases .  The objective of this manuscript is to systematic ally review the current knowledge on  exhaled VOCs  with respect to their potential clinical use in asthma , lung cancer ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , and respiratory tract infections .  A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane data base , and reference lists of retrieved studies . Controlled , clinical , English- language studies exploring the diagnostic and monitoring value of VOCs in asthma , COPD , CF , lung cancer and respiratory tract infections were included . Data on study design , setting , participant characteristics , VOCs techniques , and outcome measures were extracted .  Seventy-three studies were included , counting in total 3,952 patients and 2,973 healthy controls .  The  collection and analysis of exhaled VOCs  is non-invasive and could be easily applied in the broad range of  patients  ,  including subjects with severe disease and children .  Various research groups demonstrated that  VOCs profiles  could accurately distinguish  patients with a pulmonary disease  from healthy controls . Pulmonary diseases seem to be characterized by a disease specific breath-print , as distinct profiles were found in patients with dissimilar diseases . The heterogeneity of studies challenged the inter-laboratory comparability . In  conclusion , profiles of VOCs  are potentially able to accurately  diagnose various pulmonary diseases .  Despite these promising findings , multiple challenges such as further st and ardization and validation of the diverse techniques need to be mastered before VOCs can be applied into clinical practice."
" In general , low levels of  implementation readiness  were reported and often the information necessary to assess implementation readiness was unavailable . The only two freely available interventions had long-term funding from aging foundations . Authors pointed to the involvement of financial gatekeepers in the development process and the creation of a business model early on as important facilitators to implementation . Future research should focus on the factors enabling sustainable implementation."

"eIntroduction Synthesis of evidence on the long-term use of  first-line biologic therapy  in  patients with early rheumatoid arthritis ( RA )  is required . We compared the efficacy of up to 5 years ’ treatment with  first-line tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ( TNFis )  versus other treatment strategies in this population . Methods Previous systematic review s , PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were search ed for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) involving treatment of  methotrexate-naïve RA patients with  first-line TNFis .   Literature was synthesized qualitatively , and a meta- analysis conducted to evaluate  American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) responses , clinical remission defined by any st and ard measure , and Health Assessment Question naire Disability Index ( HAQ )  at Years 2 and /or 5 . Results  Ten RCTs involving 4306 patients [ first-line  TNFi  , n = 2234 ;  other treatment strategies ( control  ) , n = 2072 ] were  included in the meta- analysis . Three studies were double-blind for the first 2 years , while seven were partly/completely open label during this period . Five studies reported data at Year 5 ; all were open label at this time point . At Year 2  , ACR50 response , ACR70 response and remission rates  were significantly improved with  first-line TNFi  versus control in double-blind RCTs [ log-odds ratio ( OR ) 0.32 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.02 , 0.62 ; p = 0.035 ] , log-OR 0.48 ( 95 % CI 0.20 , 0.77 ; p = 0.001 ) , and log-OR 0.44 ( 95 % CI 0.13 , 0.74 ; p = 0.005 ) , respectively ] , but not in open-label studies . No significant between-group differences were observed  in mean HAQ  at Year 2 in double-blind or open-label RCTs or  in ACR response or remission outcomes  at Year 5 . Conclusion In double-blind  studies , 2-year efficacy outcomes  were significantly improved  with first-line TNFi  versus other treatment strategies in patients with MTX-naïve RA . No significant differences in these outcomes were observed when data from open-label RCTs were considered on their own . Further data on the  efficacy of TNFi  therapy over ≥ 2 years in patients with methotrexate-naïve RA are required . Plain Language Summary Plain language summary available for this article."
"eIntroduction  : Chronically ill people  are confronted with significant challenges when dealing with health care services .  Lay-led self-management programs  aim to improve self-management skills and might enable patients to make appropriate decisions as to when to use health care services . Contrary to the general attitude that self-management programs reduce health care utilisation , we suspect that better self-management skills lead to increased or possibly more appropriate  health care utilisation  . Our review and meta- analysis sheds light on the relationship between lay-led self-management programs and health care utilisation . Methods : In  March 2017 , we search ed 7 data bases ( CDSR , DARE , HTA , Medline , CINAHL , PsycInfo , and SSCI )  to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis to identify studies that reported empirical data on lay-led self-management programs and health care utilisation . We extracted the characteristics  of all primary studies and the data of four indicators of utilisation  ( physician visits , emergency department visits , hospital admissions , and length of stay in hospital )   , and analysed the role of health care utilisation in these studies . We present the results in frequency tables and as a conventional meta- analysis with the st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) , and pooled overall effect sizes using RevMan 5.3.5 . The manuscript follows the PRISMA checklist . Results : Overall ,  we  include  49 primary studies ; 10 studies provided sufficient data for the meta- analysis .   Health care utilisation  played a different role in the studies ; 15 studies reported a clear explicit hypothesis on the influence of a lay-led self-management program on health care utilisation , and 17 studies assumed an implicit assumption . 8 studies discussed the possibility that a lay-led self-management program could lead to more  appropriate health care utilisation .  The meta- analysis showed mixed results , and many effect sizes were not statistically significant . The participants of a  lay-led self-management program  had fewer  emergency department visits  ( SMD : -0.08 ; 95 % CI : -0.15 to -0.01 ; p=0.02 ) than the control group . Conclusion : Although the statistically significant effects of the meta- analysis are low , our overall findings show that only a small number of the included studies tackled the task of comprehensively investigating  self-management skills  in the context of health care utilisation . This fails to do justice to the potential of  self-management  programs . It is essential to consider the appropriateness of health care utilisation . We propose the term  self-management-sensitive utilisation  for this purpose."
"hABSTRACT The health benefits of  fish oil  , and its omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid content , have attracted much scientific attention in the last four decades .  Fish oils  that contain higher amounts of  eicosapentaenoic acid  (  EPA ; 20:5n-3 )  than  docosahexaenoic acid  ( DHA  ;  22:6n-3 ) , in a distinctive ratio of 18/12 , are typically the most abundantly available and are commonly studied . Although the two fatty acids have traditionally been considered together , as though they were one entity , different physiological effects of EPA and  DHA  have recently been reported . New oils containing a higher quantity of DHA compared with EPA , such as fractionated and concentrated  fish oil , tuna oil , calamari oil  and  microalgae oil  , are increasingly becoming available on the market , and other oils , including those extracted from genetically modified oilseed crops , soon to come . This systematic review focuses on the effects of  high DHA fish oils  on various  human health  conditions , such as the   heart  and  cardiovascular system  , the brain and visual function , inflammation and immune function and growth/Body Mass Index .  Although inconclusive results were reported in several instances , and inconsistent outcomes observed in others , current data provides substantiated evidence in support of  DHA  being a beneficial bioactive compound for heart , cardiovascular and brain function , with different , and at times complementary , effects compared with  EPA . DHA  has also been reported to be effective in  slowing the rate of cognitive decline  , while its possible effects on  depression disorders  are still unclear . Interestingly , gender- and age- specific divergent roles for  DHA  have also been reported . This review provides a comprehensive collection of evidence and a critical summary of the documented physiological effects of  high DHA fish oils  for human health."
"6Background Typically , management of PCOS focuses on  lifestyle changes ( exercise and diet )  , aim ing to alleviate symptoms , and lower the associated  risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease .  Our objective was to analyse evidence on the  effectiveness  of  exercise  in the management of PCOS , when compared to  ( i ) usual care , ( ii ) diet alone , and ( iii ) exercise combined with diet , and also exercise combined with diet , compared to ( i ) control or usual care and ( ii ) diet alone .  Methods Relevant data bases were search ed ( June 2017 ) with no time limit for trial inclusion . Eligible trials employed a r and omised or quasi-r and omised design to measure the chronic effects of  exercise , or exercise and diet  in  women with PCOS .  Results Search es  returned 2390 articles ; of those , 27 papers from 18 trials were included .  Results are presented as mean difference ( MD ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) . Compared with  control  ,  exercise  had a statistical effect on change  from baseline fasting insulin  ( MD − 2.44 μIU/mL , 95 % CIs − 4.24 to − 0.64 ; very low- quality evidence  ) , HOMA-IR  ( − 0.57 , − 0.99 to − 0.14 ; very low- quality evidence  ) , total cholesterol  ( − 5.88 mg/dL , − 9.92 to − 1.83 ; low- quality evidence  ) , LDL cholesterol  ( − 7.39 mg/dL , − 9.83 to − 4.95 ; low- quality evidence  ) , and triglycerides  ( − 4.78 mg/dL , − 7.52 to − 2.05 ; low- quality evidence ) .  Exercise  also  improved VO2 max  ( 3.84 ml/kg/min , 2.87 to  4.81 ) , waist  circumference ( − 2.62 cm , − 4.13 to  − 1.11 ) , and body fat  percentage ( − 1.39 % , − 2.61 to − 0.18 ) when compared with usual care . No effect was found for  change value systolic/diastolic blood pressure , fasting glucose , HDL cholesterol  ( all low- quality evidence ) ,  or waist-to-hip ratio  . Many favourable change score findings were supported by post-intervention value  analyses : fasting  insulin ( − 2.11 μIU/mL , − 3.49 to  − 0.73 ) , total cholesterol  ( − 6.66 mg/dL , − 11.14 to  − 2.17 ) , LDL cholesterol  ( − 6.91 mg/dL , − 12.02 to − 1.80 ) , and VO2 max ( 5.01 ml/kg/min , 3.48 to 6.54 ) . Statistically  lower  BMI ( − 1.02 kg/m2 , − 1.81 to − 0.23 )  and resting  heart rate ( − 3.26 beats/min − 4.93 to − 1.59 ) were also revealed in post-intervention analysis . Subgroup analyses revealed the greatest improvements in  overweight/obese  participants , and more outcomes improved when interventions were supervised , aerobic in nature , or of a shorter duration . Based on limited data , we found no differences for any outcome between the effects  of exercise and diet combined  ,  and diet alone .  It was not possible to  compare exercise vs diet or exercise and diet combined vs diet .  ConclusionS tatistically  beneficial effects  of exercise were found for  a range of metabolic , anthropometric , and cardiorespiratory fitness-related outcomes  . However , caution should be adopted when interpreting these findings since many outcomes present modest effects and wide CIs , and statistical effects in many analyses are sensitive to the addition/removal of individual trials . Future work should focus on rigorously design ed , well-reported trials that make comparisons involving both  exercise and diet .

The  estimated enrolment rate  was 50.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 49.6 to 51.1 ) and the  estimated attrition rates  in the intervention and control groups were 16.8 % ( 95 % CI : 16.2 to 17.3 ) and 14.4 % ( 95 % CI : 13.8 to 14.9 ) , respectively . The main reported reason for  refusing to participate  was  lack of interest  ( 70.6 % ) , while the reported reasons for  dropping  out were mainly owing to medical issues ( 26.1 % ) and disliking the intervention ( 17.9 % ) . Trial , programme , and patient-related variables were found to influence the  enrolment and /or attrition rates .  Studies that had a 10 % higher  attrition rate  had an  effect size  that was larger by 0.19 ( 95 % CI : 0.17 to 0.24 ) . Conclusion : Greater underst and ing of the factors associated with  enrolment and attrition rates  would help in planning and developing a more appealing  self-management intervention  that patients can easily accept and incorporate into their everyday lives."
"0INTRODUCTION Although the only curative strategy for pancreatic cancer is surgical resection , up to 85 % of patients relapse after surgery . The efficacy of  neoadjuvant treatment  in  resectable pancreatic cancer ( RPC )  remains unclear and there is no systematic review focusing fully on this issue . Recently , two prospect i ve trials of  neoadjuvant treatment  in RPC were terminated early because of slow recruiting and existing r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) have too small sample sizes . Therefore , to overcome probable biases , it would be more reasonable to include both RCTs and non-r and omised studies ( NRSs ) with selected criteria . This review aims to investigate the effect of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  ( CTx )  and chemoradiation therapy ( CRT )  in RPC using RCTs and specific NRSs . METHOD AND ANALYSIS This systematic review will include  conventional RCTs  as group I , and  quasi-r  and omised  controlled trials  ,  non-r  and omised  controlled trials  and prospect i ve  cohort studies  as group II . Two groups will be assessed and analysed separately . Comprehensive literature search will use Medline , Embase , Cochrane library and Scopus data bases . Additionally , we will search references from relevant studies and abstract s from major conferences . Two authors will independently identify , screen , include studies , extract data and assess the risk of bias . Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus with another author . An independent method ologist will categorise and assess NRSs to minimise heterogeneity . In each study group , meta- analysis will be conducted using a r and om-effect model and  statistical heterogeneity  will be evaluated using  I(2)-statistics . Publication  bias will be visualised with contour-enhanced funnel plots and analysed with  Egger 's test .  In group I , cumulative meta- analysis will be considered because the  CTx  regimen and  CRT  protocol have changed . The quality of evidence will be summarised using the GRADE ( Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) approach . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review does not use primary data , and formal ethical approval is not required . Findings will be disseminated through peer- review ed journals and committee conferences . TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42015023820."
"  Web-based interventions  showed positive effects on empowerment measured with the  Diabetes Empowerment Scale , disease-specific self-efficacy scales and the Pearlin Mastery Scale .  Because of the low quality of evidence we found , the results should be interpreted with caution . The clinical relevance of the findings can be question ed because the significant effects we found were , in general , small."
" The papers reporting non-specific immunological effects had heterogeneous study design s and could not be conventionally meta-analysed , providing a low level of evidence quality . Some studies , such as BCG vaccine studies examining in vitro IFN-γ responses and measles vaccine studies examining lymphoproliferation to microbial antigen stimulation , showed a consistent direction of effect suggestive of non-specific immunological effects . The quality of the evidence , however , does not provide confidence in the nature , magnitude , or timing of non-specific immunological effects after vaccination with  BCG , diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus , or measles containing vaccines  nor the clinical importance of the findings."

">A systematic review of the effectiveness of  rehabilitation  for  persons with unilateral neglect ( UN ) after stroke  was conducted by search ing the computerized data bases from 1997 through 2012 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of neglect treatment  strategies for stroke patients which used the  Behavioral  Inattention Test (  BIT  ) as the primary outcome measure  were eligible for inclusion . Out  of 201 studies initially identified , 12 RCTs covering 277 participants were selected for analysis .  All had the same weakness of low power with smaller sample s and limitation in the blinding of the design .   Prism Adaptation ( PA )   was the most commonly used intervention while  continuous Theta-burst stimulation ( cTBS )  appeared to be a new approach . Meta- analysis showed that for immediate effects ,  the BIT conventional  subscore had a  significant and large mean effect size  ( ES = 0.76 ; 95 % CI 0.28–1.23 ; p = 0.002 ) whereas  the BIT total score  showed a modestly  significant mean ES  ( ES = 0.55 ; 95 % CI 0.16–0.94 ; p = 0.006 ) .  No significant mean ES  in sensitivity analysis was found  for long-lasting effects across all BIT outcomes  .  PA  appeared to be the  most effective  intervention based on the results of pooled analysis . More rigorous studies should be done on  repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS )  before it can be concluded that it is a promising treatment for  UN ."
"gBackground In team sports , it is imperative that the warm-up improves  acute explosive performance  . However , the exact strategies , methods , and consequences of different warm-up practice s remain unclear . A time delay between the warm-up and match and during half-time could negate the positive metabolic effects of the warm-up . Objectives We conducted a systematic review to synthesize and analyze the potential effects of strategies during a  warm-up ( before match )  ,  post-warm-up  ( time between the  end of warm-up and  the  start of a match )  , and  re-warm-up ( half-time break within a match  ) on  explosive performance  in team sports . Furthermore , we examined optimal warm-up strategies based on the included studies . Methods We performed a search of  four  data bases ( Web of Science , Scopus , PubMed , and ScienceDirect ) for  original research articles published between January 1981 and August 2017 . A total of 30 articles met the inclusion criteria  , and the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias . The results of the included studies were recalculated to determine effect sizes using Cohen ’s d. Results A warm-up comprising 8 sets of 60-m sprints ( − 2.19 % , d = 1.20 )  improved sprint performance  . Additionally , 7 min of dynamic exercises after 5 min of jogging  improved sprint  ( − 7.69 % , d =  1.72 ) , jumping  ( 8.61 % , d =  0.61 ) , and agility performance  ( − 6.65 % , d = 1.40 ) . The use of  small-sided  games also seems to be a valid strategy ,  especially for jumping performance  ( 6 % , d = 0.8 ) . These benefits result ed from the warm-up strategies combined with some passive rest ( between 2 and 10 min ) before the main performance . In this post-warm-up period , the use  of heated garments  could result in better outcomes than simple rest ( − 0.89 % , d = 0.39 ) . However , if the transition was longer than 15 min , before entering the match , performing a re-warm-up with  short-term  explosive tasks to reactivate was the most effective approach ( − 1.97 % , d = − 0.86 ) . At half-time , heated garments  maintained better sprint ( − 1.45 %  ,  d = 2.21 ) and jumping performance (  3.13  %  , d = 1.62 ) . Conclusion Applying properly structured strategies in the warm-up and avoiding a long rest in the post-warm-up  improves explosive performance .  Studies tend to recommend a short active warm-up strategy ( 10–15 min ) , gradually increasing intensity ( ~ 50–90 % of maximum heart rate ) , and the use of heated garments soon after the warm-up to maintain muscle temperature . However , 2 min of active re-warm-up with short-term sprints and jumps should be needed for transitions longer than 15 min ( ~ 90 % of maximum heart rate ) . Last , at the half-time re-warm-up , combining heated garments to maintain muscle temperature and performing an active strategy , with explosive tasks or small-sided games for 5 min before re-entering the game , result ed in  better explosive performance  than 15 min of resting."
"sBackground To assess the effectiveness of  physical therapy ( PT ) interventions  on functioning in  children with cerebral palsy ( CP ) .  Methods A search was made in Medline , Cinahl , PEDro and the Cochrane library for the period 1990 to February 2007 . Only r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on  PT interventions  in  children with diagnosed CP were  included . Two review ers independently assessed the method ological quality and extracted the data . The outcomes measured in the trials were classified using the  International Classification of Functioning , Disability and Health ( ICF ) .  Results  Twenty-two trials were identified .  Eight intervention categories were distinguished . Four trials were of high method ological quality . Moderate evidence of  effectiveness  was established for two intervention categories :   effectiveness   of   upper extremity treatments   on   attained goals  and  active supination   , and  of  prehensile h  and  treatment  and  neurodevelopmental  therapy ( NDT )  or  NDT  twice a week on developmental status , and of  constraint-induced therapy  on  amount and quality of h  and  use .  Moderate evidence of  ineffectiveness  was found of  strength training  on  walking speed and stride length .  Conflicting evidence was found for  strength training  on  gross motor function .  For the other intervention categories the evidence was limited due to low method ological quality and the statistically insignificant results of the studies . Conclusion Due to limitations in method ological quality and variations in population , interventions and outcomes , mostly limited evidence on the effectiveness of most  PT  interventions is available through RCTs . Moderate evidence was found for some effectiveness of upper extremity training . Well- design ed trials are needed especially for focused PT interventions."
" High to moderate quality evidence indicates that both  traditional and COX-2 NSAIDs  are efficacious for treating axSpA , and moderate to low quality evidence indicates harms may not differ from placebo in the short term . Various NSAIDs are equally effective . Continuous  NSAID  use may reduce  radiographic spinal progression  , but this requires confirmation."
"gBackground The concept of warming-up before a performance has been accepted across many disciplines including sports and music . In contrast , it is uncommon for a surgeon to “ warm-up ” prior to operating . Objective To date , few studies from various specialties have attempted to answer this question whether warm-up improved the intraoperative performance of the surgeon . However , there has not been a systematic review of these studies . The aim of our systematic review is to assess the effect of  warming-up preoperatively  on the laparoscopic performance of the surgeon . Methods Pubmed and scopus were search ed to identify  all published prospect i ve observational studies , which involved either residents , fellows or attending surgeons .  We  excluded case reports , review s , non-English studies , and medical student participation .  Study risk of bias were assessed regarding sequence generation , allocation concealment , blinding , incomplete outcome data , selective outcome reporting , and other biases , using a vali date d Cochrane Collaboration ’s tool . Results  Out of 241 studies , 6 met the inclusion criteria .  All  included studies were r and omized  with half of them being  r  and  omized  controlled studies and the rest r and omized crossover studies .  The total number of operative cases was 196 , including 98 warm-up and 98 non warm-up . The total number of participants was 87 , with the largest number in a single study being 38 and the average sample size of all studies was 14 .  All six studies assessed various  aspects of laparoscopic surgical performances  . Significant improvement in the  intraoperative laparoscopic performance  was observed with warming-up preoperatively in five out of six studies ( p < 0.05 ) . The sixth study failed to reach statistical significance ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusion  Warming-up  before an operative procedure improve  a  trainee ’s  technical , cognitive , and psychomotor performance .  Further studies are necessary to assess the ways in which warm-up could impact a  surgeon ’s performance  , and to identify the optimal timing and duration of warm-up prior to operating."
" Fortifying staple foods with  vitamin  A alone may make little or no difference to  serum retinol concentrations  or the  risk of sub clinical vitamin A deficiency  . In comparison with provision of unfortified foods , provision of staple foods  fortified with vitamin A plus other micronutrients  may not increase  serum retinol concentration  but probably reduces the risk of  sub clinical vitamin A deficiency  . Compared to no intervention , staple foods  fortified with vitamin A plus other micronutrients  may increase  serum  retinol concentration , although it is uncertain whether the intervention reduces the risk of  sub clinical vitamin  A deficiency as the certainty of the evidence has been assessed as very low . It was not possible to estimate the effect of staple food fortification on  outcomes such as mortality , morbidity , adverse effects , congenital anomalies , or breast milk vitamin A  , as no trials included these outcomes .The type of funding source for the studies did not appear to distort the results from the analysis."
"nAmong all gynaecological neoplasms , ovarian cancer has the highest rate of disease-related malnutrition , representing an important risk factor of postoperative mortality and morbidity . Hence , the importance of finding effective  nutritional  interventions is crucial to improve  ovarian cancer patient 's  well-being and  survival .  This systematic review of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) aims at assessing the effects of  nutritional interventions  on clinical outcomes such as  overall survival , progression-free survival , length of hospital stay ( LOS ) , complications  following surgery and /or chemotherapy in  ovarian cancer patients .  Three electronic bibliographic data bases ( MEDLINE , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) were used to conduct a systematic literature search based on fixed inclusion and exclusion criteria , until  December  2018  . A total of 14 studies were identified .  Several early postoperative feeding interventions studies ( n = 8) were retrieved mainly demonstrating a reduction  in LOS  and an  ameliorated intestinal recovery  after surgery . Moreover , innovative  nutritional approaches  such as  chewing gum intervention ( n = 1 ) , coffee consumption (  n  =  1  ) , ketogenic diet intervention ( n = 2 ) or fruit and vegetable juice concentrate supplementation diet  ( n  =  1  )  and  short-term fasting  ( n = 1 ) have been shown as valid and well-tolerated nutritional strategies improving clinical outcomes . However , despite an acceptable number of prospect i ve trials , there is still a lack of homogeneous and robust endpoints . In particular , there is an urgent need of RCTs evaluating  overall survival and progression-free survival  during ovarian oncology treatments . Further high- quality studies are warranted , especially prospect i ve studies and large RCTs , with more homogeneous types of intervention and clinical outcomes , including a more specific sampling of  ovarian cancer women  , to identify appropriate and effective nutritional strategies for this cancer , which is at high risk of malnutrition."

"0Objective To synthesis e the evidence for the  multifaceted self-management interventions  for  older women with urinary incontinence ( UI )  and to underst and the outcomes associated with these interventions . Design A systematic review and narrative synthesis to identify r and omised controlled trials that investigated the effect of  multifaceted self-management interventions  for  older women with UI .  Methods MEDLINE , PsycINFO , EMBASE , The Cochrane Library , CINAHL and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstract s data bases were search ed  ( January 1990 to May 2019 )  using a systematic search strategy , complemented by manually screening the reference lists and citation indexes . Study selection , data extraction and risk of bias assessment were undertaken independently . A narrative synthesis was undertaken in which studies , interventions and outcomes were examined based on the intervention components . The effect size and 95 % CI were estimated from each study . Results  A total of 13 147 citations were identified and 16 studies were included .  There was no study rated as of high quality . Three types of multifaceted interventions were found : those that had an element of  pelvic floor muscle exercises ( PFME )  , those with  bladder retraining  and some with  combination behavioural interventions .  Outcome measures varied across studies . A statistically significant improvement in  incontinence symptoms  was reported in the intervention group compared with the control in 15 studies . Conclusion Multifaceted interventions that included  PFME , bladder retraining  or  combination behavioural techniques  appear to be useful in some setting s for UI management in  older women  , but the quality of the evidence was poor and unclear . There was insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the combination of components is superior to others in improving  UI symptoms .  There is a need for high- quality studies to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions and to identify comparative effectiveness . PROSPERO registration number CRD42018104010."
"tPeriodontal bone regeneration relies on coupled and cooperative bone formation and resorption . Accordingly a novel strategy on concurrent use of  platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) ( anabolic agent ) and 1 % alendronate ( ALN ) ( anticatabolic agent )  was proposed recently in regenerative periodontal treatment . It was supposed to enhance bone formation and reduce bone resorption simultaneously . However , there is a lack of evidence -based studies to answer whether this concurrent application was superior to single application until now . Besides , concerns on  ALN  lead to some reservation on this synergistic way .  ALN  may impair  new bone formation  and  necrotize jaws  . Thus , in order to compare the clinical efficacy between  PRF plus 1%ALN  and  PRF  alone on  periodontal bone regeneration  , we performed present systematic review and meta- analysis . Because it is the prerequisite for measuring the combined efficacy of  PRF plus 1%ALN  , firstly we evaluated the effectiveness of 1%ALN  .  Our data indicated that adjunctive 1%ALN was effective in  promoting periodontal bone repair .  Further ,  PRF  plus 1%ALN showed a  greater capacity for periodontal regeneration  than  PRF  alone with statistical significance . The findings of this study revealed the promising prospect s on synergistic application of   bone anabolic agents  ( PRF )  and   antiresorption medications  (  1%ALN  )  in regenerative periodontal treatment."
"sA systematic review was conducted to assess the available evidence for the effectiveness of interventions aim ing to improve the  comprehensibility of health-related documents  in  older adults ( ≥50 ) with different levels of health literacy .  Seven data bases were search ed ( 2005 forward ) , and references in relevant review s were checked . The selection procedure was conducted by 2 independent review ers . Data extraction and assessment of the quality of the result ing studies were conducted by 1 review er and checked for accuracy by a 2nd review er . A total of  38 intervention studies had a study population of older adults ( n = 35 ) or made an explicit comparison between age groups , including older adults ( n = 3 ) .  Inconsistent evidence was found for the importance of design features to enhance the  comprehensibility of health-related documents  . Only for narratives and multiple-feature revisions ( e.g. , combining revisions in textual and visual characteristics ) did the included studies provide evidence that they may be effective for older adults . Using narrative formats and /or multiple-feature revisions of health-related documents seem to be promising strategies for  enhancing the comprehensibility of health-related documents  for older adults . The lack of consistent evidence for  effective  interventions stresses the importance of ( a ) replication and ( b ) the use of st and ardized research method ologies."
"7Background : Resting Motor threshold ( rMT ) is one of the measurement obtained by  Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS )  that reflects corticospinal excitability . As a functional marker of the corticospinal pathway , the question arises whether rMT is a suitable biomarker for predicting post-stroke upper limb function . To that aim , we conducted a systematic review of relevant studies that investigated the clinical significance of  rMT  in  stroke survivors  by using correlations between upper limb motor scores and rMT . Methods : Studies that reported correlations between upper limb motor function and rMT as a measure of corticospinal excitability in distal arm muscle were identified via a literature search in  stroke patients .  Two authors extracted the data using a home-made specific form . Subgroup analyses were carried out with patients classified with respect to time post-stroke onset ( early vs. chronic stage ) and stroke location ( cortical , subcortical , or cortico-subcortical ) .  Method ological quality  of the study was also evaluated by a published checklist . Results :  Eighteen studies with 22 groups ( n = 508 stroke patients )  were included in this systematic review .  Mean method ological quality score  was 14.75/24 .  rMT  was often correlated with  motor function or h and dexterity  ( n = 15/22 , 68 % ) , explaining on average 31 % of the variance of the motor score . Moreover , the results did not seem impacted if patients were examined at the early or chronic stages of stroke . Two findings could not be properly interpreted : ( i ) the fact that the  rMT  is an independent predictor of  motor function  as several confounding factors are well-established , and , ( ii ) whether the stroke location impacts this prediction . Conclusion : Most of the studies found a correlation between  rMT  and upper limb motor function after stroke . However , it is still unclear if  rMT  is an independent predictor of  upper limb motor function  when taking into account for age , time post stroke onset and level of corticospinal tract damage as confounding factors . Clear-cut conclusions could not be drawn at that time but our results suggest that  rMT  could be a suitable c and i date although future investigations are needed .

"sProvisions for post-trial access ( PTA ) of the experimental intervention are required before the start of a clinical trial . Although there has been ample attention for PTA in the context of preventive vaccine research , discussion s on PTA barely include maternal vaccine trials in which  mother-infant pairs  are exposed to the intervention . In maternal vaccination trials , specific PTA arrangements are required because pregnancy is transient and PTA may apply to the next pregnancy or the child . In this article , we examine the application and adherence to PTA in the context of  maternal vaccine trials .  We focused on differences between publications before and after 2000 when international ethical guidance documents formalized PTA requirements . R and omized  maternal vaccine trials  were included after a systematic search for clinical trials in phases II and III with a  maternal vaccine  as intervention . We used PTA as defined at the time of publication in the World Medical Association 's Declaration of Helsinki ( DoH ) or in the ethical guidelines of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences ( CIOMS ) . In addition , we investigated whether PTA was included in the trial design . Therefore , we contacted principal investigators ( PI 's ) of the publications found in the review to fill out a question naire regarding provisions for PTA . Before and after 2000 , no trial articles examined in the systematic review described PTA in their trial publication ( 0/7 , 0 % and 0/17 , 0 % , respectively ) . In addition , more than half of the PI 's of the trials found were not familiar with PTA recommendations in international ethical guidelines . Most cases of PTA included making knowledge available by publishing the results of the trial . The revision of the DoH in 2002 and the CIOMS ethical guidelines in 2002 has not result ed in increased PTA provisions for maternal vaccination trials . PTA is a shared responsibility of various stakeholders including sponsors , Institutional Review Boards , regulators , political entities , and research ers . Inclusion of PTA provisions in trial protocol s and publications on maternal vaccination trials is essential to increase transparency on the form and content of these provisions."

"dThe aim of this systematic review is to critically evaluate  cytoreductive surgery combined with heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy  in the  treatment of ovarian cancer .  A systematic review of all manuscripts published in the English literature that met predetermined inclusion criteria was carried out . Data concerning  cytoreductive surgery  , method and agents for administration of  heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy  ,  morbidity , mortality , hospital stay  and  survival  were extracted , critically review ed and tabulated .  Fourteen studies were analyzed .  A wide variety of drug doses , methods of  intraperitoneal chemotherapy  administration and volume of chemotherapy solution were used . Seven studies showed that  patients  with complete cytoreduction had the greatest benefit . The  median overall survival  for primary and recurrent disease ranged from 22 to 54 months and the median  disease-free survival  from 10 to 26 months . The  rates of significant morbidity  associated with this combined treatment were low , ranging from 5 % to 36 % . The  median mortality  was 3 % ( range 0%-10 % ) .  Cytoreductive surgery combined with heated intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy  is a treatment option for  patients with ovarian cancer  that is worthy of further investigation . Selection criteria for patients most likely to benefit need to be defined."
"DBACKGROUND Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is a common comorbidity with type 2 diabetes . The existing therapeutic options for NAFLD are not adequate .  Hypocaloric diet and exercise  is the cornerstone of therapy in NAFLD .  Pioglitazone  is the only drug recommended in  diabetes patients with biopsy proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis .  The frequent coexistence of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes with their combined adverse health consequences and inadequate therapeutic options makes it necessary to search for newer alternatives . AIM To assess the effect of  sodium glucose cotransporter-2 ( SGLT-2 ) inhibitors  on liver enzymes in  type 2 diabetes patients with NAFLD .  METHODS We search ed PubMed / MEDLINE , Cochrane library , Google scholar , and Clinical trials.gov for the relevant articles to be included in this systematic review .  Human studies done in type 2 diabetes patients with NAFLD treated with  SGLT-2 inhibitors  for at least 12 wk were included  . Data from eight studies ( four r and omised controlled trials and four observational studies ) were extracted and a narrative synthesis was done .  A total of 214 patients were treated with  SGLT-2 inhibitors  in these studies  ( 94 in r and omised controlled trials and 120 in observational studies ) . RESULTS The primary outcome measure was  change in serum alanine aminotransferase level .  Out of eight studies , seven studies showed a significant decrease in  serum alanine aminotransferase level .  Most of the studies revealed reduction in  serum level of other liver enzymes like aspartate aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transferase .  Five studies that reported a change in hepatic fat exhibited a significant reduction in  hepatic fat content  in those treated with  SGLT-2 inhibitors .  Likewise , among the three studies that evaluated a change in  indices of hepatic fibrosis  , two studies revealed a significant improvement in  liver fibrosis .  Moreover , there was an improvement in  obesity , insulin resistance , glycaemia , and lipid parameters  in those subjects taking  SGLT-2 inhibitors .  The studies disclosed that about 17 % ( 30/176 ) of the subjects taking  SGLT-2 inhibitors  developed  adverse events  and more than 40 % ( 10/23 ) of them had  genitourinary tract infections .   Based on low to moderate quality of evidence ,  SGLT-2 inhibitors  improve the  serum level of liver enzymes  , decrease  liver fat  , and fibrosis with additional beneficial effects on various metabolic parameters in type 2 diabetes patients with NAFLD."
"CThe real impact of specific sites of metastasis on prognosis of  metastatic pancreatic cancer ( MPC )  is unknown . To evaluate the association of specific metastatic sites and  survival outcomes  in  MPC  a systematic literature review was performed including prospect i ve r and omized trials of  systemic treatments  in metastatic pancreatic cancer indexed in PubMed , Embase and Web of Science . Data regarding   systemic treatment  regimens , progression free survival and overall survival  were extracted . The outcomes were compared using a r and om effects model . The index I2 and the graphs of funnel plot were used for the interpretation of the data .  Of 1,052 abstract s , 7 r and omized trials were considered eligible with a combined sample size of 2,975 MPC patients .  Combining the studies with meta- analysis , we could see that  patients with liver metastasis  had a  HR for death  of 1.53 with 95 % CI of 1.15 to 2.02 ( p-value 0.003 ) and  HR for risk of progression  of 1.96 with 95 % CI of 1.28 to 2.99 ( p-value 0.002 ) , without significant heterogeneity . Having two or more sites of metastasis comparing to one site did not have impact on  overall survival ;  RR of 1.05 with 95 % CI 0.91 to 1.23 ( p-value 0.493 ) . In conclusion ,  liver  metastasis confers  worse outcomes   among patients with MPC .  Apparently , multiple metastatic sites do not present  worse prognosis  when compared with only one organ involved , therefore , demonstrating the severity of this disease . Prospect i ve studies evaluating other treatments are necessary to address the impact of local treatments in liver metastasis in MPC."

"gMethod ological criteria that increase the validity of  r and omised trials  are often not considered in respiratory research , even in large  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) trials .  We describe four important aspects in the design , analysis and reporting of   r  and omised trials  , selected based on their relevance to current COPD research and based on our judgments of importance for research ers and users of the literature . First , to optimally control for confounding , where confounding refers to a factor that is associated with an exposure or intervention and influences the outcome , a clear definition of the main relationship between treatment and the primary outcome as well as identification of measurable confounders is required . In addition to r and omisation per se as the key method to protect against confounding , restriction ( excluding patients with specific characteristics that may introduce confounding ) , stratification ( separate r and omisation of patients with specific characteristics ) and statistical adjustment are means to be considered to optimally control for confounding that simple r and omisation may not achieve . Secondly , the selection of the primary outcome should be guided by the importance to patients . Secondary outcomes provide hypotheses about the effects observed for the primary outcome and can provide important data for systematic review s and meta-analyses , but should be interpreted with caution in single trials . Thirdly , in study power calculations , not only the actual sample size , but the number of events , has a large influence on the power of the study and , often , unrealistic assumptions about event rates are made to increase the feasibility of trials . Finally , essential steps to transfer results from research to practice include complete reporting of trials and developing tools , such as decision aids , to support patients and physicians in their shared decision making."
"hAbstract The beneficial effect of  balanced protein energy supplementation  during pregnancy on subsequent child growth is unclear and may depend upon the mother entering pregnancy adequately nourished or undernourished . Systematic review s to‐ date have included studies from  high‐ , middle‐ and low‐income countries  . However , the effect of  balanced protein energy supplementation  should not be generalised . This review assesses the effect of  balanced protein energy supplementation  in  undernourished pregnant women from low‐ and middle‐income countries on child growth .  A systematic review of  articles published in English ( 1970–2015 )  was conducted via MEDLINE , Scopus , the Cochrane Register and h and search ing . Only peer‐ review ed experimental studies analysing the effects of  balanced protein energy supplementation  in  undernourished pregnant women from low‐ and middle‐income countries  with measures of physical  growth  as the primary outcome were included . Two review ers independently assessed full‐text articles against inclusion criteria . Validity of eligible studies was ascertained using the  Quality Assessment Tool  for Quantitative Studies ( EPHPP QAT ) . In total ,  seven studies met the inclusion criteria .  All studies reported  on birthweight  , five on  birth length  , three on  birth head circumference  , and one on  longer‐term growth .  St and ardised mean differences were calculated using a r and om‐effects meta‐ analysis  . Balanced protein energy supplementation  significantly  improved birthweight  ( seven r and omised controlled trials , n = 2367 ; d = 0.20 , 95 % confidence interval , 0.03–0.38 , P = 0.02 ) . No significant benefit was  observed on birth length or birth head circumference  . Impact of intervention could not be determined for  longer‐term  physical growth due to limited evidence . Additional research is required in  low‐ and middle‐income countries  to identify impacts on longer‐term infant growth."
"  Health communication campaigns that combine mass media and other communication channels  with distribution of free or reduced-price health-related products are effective in  improving healthy behaviors .  This intervention is expected to be applicable across  U.S. demographic  groups , with appropriate population targeting . The ability to draw more specific conclusions about other important social marketing practice s is constrained by limited reporting of intervention components and characteristics."
" There may be scope for using existing research more effectively to contribute to evidence based policy to reduce  social inequalities  in  smoking-by  explicitly seeking stratified outcome data in new systematic review s , by re-analysing original data sets , and /or by meta- analysis of individual participant data."
"yIntroduction The effects of different  mechanical ventilation ( MV ) modes  on  mortality outcome  in  infants with respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS )  are not well known . Methods We search ed the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) in the Cochrane Library , EMBASE , MEDLINE , CINAHL , and Web of Science for studies published through April 2014 that assessed  mortality   in infants with RDS given different  MV modes .   We assessed studies for eligibility , extracted data , and subsequently pooled the data . A Bayesian fixed-effects model was used to combine direct comparisons with indirect evidence . We also performed sensitivity analyses and rankings of the competing treatment modes . Results In total ,  20 r and omized controlled trials were included for the network meta- analysis  , which consisted of  2,832 patients who received one of 16 ventilation modes .  Compared with  synchronized intermittent m and atory ventilation ( SIMV ) + pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) , time-cycled pressure-limited ventilation  ( TCPL ) ( hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.290 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.071 to 0.972 ) ,  high-frequency oscillatory ventilation  ( HFOV ) ( HR 0.294 ; 95 % CI 0.080 to 0.852 ) ,  SIMV + volume-guarantee  ( VG ) ( HR 0.122 ; 95 % CI 0.014 to 0.858 ) , and volume-controlled ( V-C ) ( HR 0.139 ; 95 % CI 0.024 to 0.677 ) ventilation modes are associated with  lower mortality .  The combined results of available ventilation modes were not significantly different in regard to the  incidences of patent ductus arteriosus and intraventricular hemorrhage .  Conclusion Compared with the  SIMV + PSV  ventilation mode , the TCPL , HFOV , SIMV + VG , and  V-C  ventilation modes are associated with lower mortality."

"yOncology  acupuncture  has become a new and promising field of research because more and more  cancer patients  have sought  non-pharmacological  alternatives for symptom management . While different mechanisms have been proposed to explain its efficacy , including theories of the neural system , endocrine cytokine or immunological regulation , its eventual role has become that of alleviating the side effects induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy . In this paper , we have review ed the related articles focusing on  acupuncture  mechanisms and applications in cancer care to provide a quick sketch of  acupuncture  in cancer care . A detailed search was performed to identify the r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and systematic review s on  acupuncture  in oncology , using PUBMED and Cochrane . The search terms included : Acupuncture , acupressure , and cancer . Additional terms were used to target specific symptoms ( i.e. , breast cancer , hot flash , xerostomia , nausea , vomiting , cancer pain , insomnia , fatigue ) . Two authors independently extracted data for analysis and review . Ultimately , 25 articles underwent full-text review . Recent trials made efforts in study ing ( a )  hot flashes in breast cancer  , ( b )  xerostomia induced by  radiotherapy  in head and neck cancer  , ( c )  nausea and vomiting post-chemotherapy  , ( d )  cancer pain  , and ( e )  fatigue and insomnia  in  cancer patients  . Controversial results for  acupuncture  application in cancer care appeared in different categories , but a trend emerged that  acupuncture  can palliate cancer-related symptoms . The research to date certainly offers us a valid complementary therapy in treating cancer-related symptoms . Meanwhile , practical strategies with safe measures for enhancing the efficacy are needed in further interventions , as well as continuing research with a vali date d methodology."
" :  Exhaled breath analysis  has a promising role in the underst and ing of mechanisms underpinning OSAS and has demonstrated a clinical relevance in identifying individuals affected by the disease , in assessing the response to treatment and , potentially , to monitor patient 's adherence to mechanical ventilation . Albeit the majority of the technical st and ards proposed by the ERS committee have been followed by existing papers , further work is needed to uniform the methodology."
" Clinician-patient alliance and communication are associated with more favourable  patient adherence .  Further research of observer rated communication would better facilitate the application of findings in clinical practice . Establishing agreement on the tasks of treatment , utilising collaborative styles of communication and discussion of treatment specifics may be important for clinicians in promoting cooperation with regimens . These findings align with those in health communication . However , the benefits of shared decision making for adherence in mental health are less conclusive than in general medicine."
"sUse of  n-3 fatty acids ( FA )  has been reported to be beneficial for  cancer patients .  We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to issue recommendations on the clinical use of  n-3 FA  in the  cancer setting .  A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane and Healthstar data bases . We selected  clinical trials or prospect i ve observational studies including patients with cancer and life expectancy > 2 months , in which  enteral supplements with n-3 FA  were administered .  Parameters evaluated individually were  clinical ( nutritional status , tolerance , survival and hospital stays ) , biochemical ( inflammatory mediators )  , and  functional ( functional status , appetite and quality of life ( QoL ) ) .   Seventeen studies met  the inclusion criteria  ;  eight were of  high  quality . The panel of experts established the following evidence : ( 1 ) oral supplements with  n-3 FA  benefit  patients with advanced  cancer  and  weight loss   , and are indicated in tumours of the upper digestive tract and pancreas ; ( 2 ) the advantages observed were :  increased weight and appetite , improved QoL , and reduced post-surgical morbidity ;  ( 3 ) there is no defined pattern for combining different  n-3 FA  , and it is recommended to administer > 1.5 g/day ; and ( 4 ) better  tolerance  is obtained administering low-fat formulas for a period of at least 8 weeks . All the evidence s were grade B but for  ' length of treatment '  and  ' advantage of survival '  it was grade C. Our findings suggest that administration of  n-3 FA ( EPA  and  DHA )  in doses of at least 1.5 g/day for a prolonged period of time to  patients with advanced cancer  is associated with an improvement in clinical , biological and QoL parameters."
"sBrodalumab is an anti-IL-17 receptor monoclonal antibody currently in development for the treatment of  moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis .  With many systemic psoriasis therapies to choose from , and several newer agents in development , physicians need up to date evidence for the use of these drugs . A PubMed search was conducted through August 1 , 2014 to identify r and omized controlled trials and systematic review s of  brodalumab  for the treatment  of psoriasis  . Results of Phase I and II trials , as well as a few smaller studies , have provided promising data on  efficacy , safety , health-related quality of life , pharmacokinetics , and changes in lesional skin .  Early Phase III data continue to support the use of  brodalumab  as a potentially valuable option for the treatment of psoriasis."
"yThe aim of this article was to review current evidence about  cryotherapy  in  inflammatory rheumatic diseases  ( therapeutic and biological effects ) . For therapeutic effects , we performed a systematic review ( PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , LILACS data bases , unpublished data ) and selected studies including  non-operated and non-infected arthritic patients treated with  local cryotherapy or whole-body cryotherapy .   By pooling  6 studies including 257 rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients  , we showed a significant decrease in  pain visual analogic scale ( mm ) and 28-joint disease activity score  after chronic cryotherapy in RA patients . For molecular pathways , local  cryotherapy  induces an  intrajoint temperature decrease  , which might downregulate several  mediators involved in joint inflammation and destruction  ( cytokines , cartilage-degrading enzymes , proangiogenic factors ) , but studies in RA are rare .  Cryotherapy  should be included in RA therapeutic strategies as an adjunct therapy , with potential  corticosteroid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug dose-sparing effects .  However , techniques and protocol s should be more precisely defined in r and omized controlled trials with stronger methodology."
" This study shows that , in  patients with PCOS  ,  COCs  can effectively  improve biochemical and clinical parameters of HA .

"hThe  Health Belief  Model provides a framework to underst and motivators for  volunteering for medical research .  Motivators can take the form of social and personal benefits . In this systematic review of review articles , we contrast motivators of  participation in actual cancer trials  to those in actual  HIV vaccine  trials . We retrieved  eight review articles from 2000 to 2012 examining motivators to participation in actual cancer trials .  Personal benefits were most often psychological in nature , such as  "" coping with symptoms .  "" Social benefits included ""  advancing research  , "" "" helping  other  cancer  patients  , "" and "" for  their family  . "" While specific motivators vary between considerations - cancer research and HIV vaccine trials , these motivators fall into similar categories at similar frequencies . For example ,  personal/psychological benefits  are common in each . Participant recruitment must be mindful of these categories of motivators for both cancer and HIV vaccine research."
" :  Therapeutic life review  is potentially beneficial for  people near the end of life .  However , the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of r and omized controlled trials and associated method ological weaknesses . Further rigorously design ed r and omized controlled trials are warranted."
" There is limited evidence that  cyclosporine  is more effective than st and ard treatment alone for severe ulcerative colitis . The relatively quick response makes the short-term use of  cyclosporine  potentially attractive , but the long-term benefit is unclear , when adverse events such as  cyclosporine-induced  nephrotoxicity may become more obvious . There is a need for additional research on  quality of life , costs and long-term results  from  cyclosporine  therapy in severe ulcerative colitis."
" Peer support  increases  the duration of EBF  in  LMICs ;  however , the effect appears to be reduced in formula feeding cultures .

" Partial meniscal substitution using  acellular scaffolds in selected patients with irreparable  loss of tissue   may be a safe and promising procedure . However , there is only 1 r and omized controlled study supporting its application , and globally , many method ologic issues of published trials limit further conclusions . We registered a different trend in pre clinical trials , with most considering  augmentation of scaffolds by cells and /or GFs  , as opposed to the predominantly acellular approach in clinical trials . Different TERM approaches to enhance  meniscal repair or regeneration  are in pre clinical analysis , such as the  use of mesenchymal stem cells , gene therapy , and GFs alone or in combination  , and thus could be considered in the design of subsequent trials . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level IV , systematic review of Level I to IV studies."
"sMany national guidelines recommend annual  influenza vaccination  of  immunocompromised patients  , although the decision to vaccinate is usually at clinical discretion . We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess the evidence for  influenza vaccination  in this group , and we report our results by etiology . Meta-analyses showed significantly lower odds of  influenza-like illness  after vaccination in  patients with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , patients with cancer , and transplant recipients  and  of laboratory-confirmed influenza in HIV-positive patients  , compared with patients receiving  placebo  or no vaccination  .  Pooled  odds of seroconversion and seroprotection  were typically lower in  HIV-positive patients , patients with cancer , and transplant recipients  , compared with immunocompetent controls  .  Vaccination was generally  well tolerated  , with variation in  mild adverse events  between etiological groups . Limited evidence of a  transient increase in viremia and a decrease in the percentage of CD4(+ ) cells in  HIV-positive patients   was found although not accompanied by  worsening of clinical symptoms .  Clinical judgment remains important when discussing the benefits and safety profile with immunocompromised patients."
"tThis systematic review aim ed to investigate the association between  maternal smoking during pregnancy and  birth defects in children .   We performed an electronic search of observational studies in the data bases ovid MEDLINE ( 1950 to April 2010 ) , LILACS and SciELO .  We  included  188 studies with a total of 13,564,914 participants ( 192,655 cases ) .  Significant positive associations were found between maternal smoking  and birth defects  in the following body systems  : cardiovascular  ( OR : 1.11 ; 95%CI : 1.03 - 1.19 ) ,  digestive  ( OR : 1.18 ; 95%CI : 1.07 - 1.30 ) ,  musculoskeletal  ( OR : 1.27 ; 95%CI : 1.16 - 1.39 ) and  face and neck  ( OR : 1.28 ; 95%CI : 1.19 - 1.37 ) . The  strength of association between maternal smoking and birth defects  measured by  the OR ( 95%CI )  is significantly related to the amount  of  cigarettes smoked daily ( χ2 = 12.1 ; df = 2 ; p = 0.002 ) . In conclusion ,  maternal smoking during pregnancy   is associated with  congenital malformations in children   and this association is dose-dependent."
"sAIMS To assess the effect of  peer support intervention  on   diabetes distress  in people with type 2 diabetes .  BACKGROUND  Diabetes distress  may be decreased by  peer support intervention  , but findings about the effect of  peer support  on  diabetes distress  have been mixed . DESIGN A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled studies . DATA SOURCES PubMed , Embase , CENTRAL , PsycINFO , Web of Science , and CINAHL data bases were search ed for r and omized controlled trials from inception to 30 June 2018 . REVIEW METHODS Investigators assessed eligibility , extracted data , and assessed method ological quality . St and ardized mean difference and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for pooled effect size . RESULTS A total of  13 studies included in systematic review and 10 in meta- analysis  . In the r and om-effects model , the pooled effect size showed  current peer support intervention  did not significantly  reduce diabetes  distress  in type 2 diabetes population  compared with usual care .  High quality and well- design ed studies targeting at reducing  diabetes distress  are needed to further test the effect  of  peer  support intervention  on diabetes distress."

"dThe aim of this paper was to provide reliable evidence by performing a systematic review and meta- analysis for evaluating the role of  acupuncture  in  assisted reproductive technology .  All r and omized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of  acupuncture  , including  manual , electrical , and laser acupuncture ( LA ) techniques  , on the  clinical pregnancy rate ( CPR )  and  live birth rate ( LBR )  of  in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or artificial insemination  were included . The controlled groups consisted of  no acupuncture  and  sham acupuncture  groups  .  The  sham acupuncture  included  sham acupuncture at acupoints , sham acupuncture at non- or inappropriate points , sham LA , and adhesive tapes .   Twenty-three trials ( a total of 5598 participants ) were  included in this paper . The  pooled CPR  from all  acupuncture  groups was significantly higher than that from all controlled groups , whereas the  LBR  was not significantly different between the two groups . However , the results were quite distinct when the type of control and /or different acupuncture times were examined in a sensitivity analysis . The results mainly indicate that  acupuncture  , especially around the time of the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , improves  pregnancy outcomes  in  women undergoing IVF .  More positive effects from  acupuncture  in IVF can be expected if a more individualized  acupuncture  programs are used."
" The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis revealed that  HBMS programmes  in  breast cancer survivors  appear to have a short-term beneficial effect of improving  breast cancer-specific quality of life and global quality of life  as measured by FACT-B and EORTC-C30 , respectively . In addition ,  HBMS programmes  are associated with a reduction in  anxiety , fatigue and insomnia  immediately after the intervention . We assessed the quality of evidence across studies as moderate for some outcomes , meaning that we are fairly confident about the results , while we assessed other outcomes as being low- quality , meaning that we are uncertain about the result."
"sIntroduction The  Latino population  is the most rapidly growing ethnic minority in the United States and Latinas have higher rates of advanced breast cancer and more rigorous treatments than White women . However , the literature lacks review s on  quality of life  among this population of  breast cancer patients .  Methods A systematic review of the breast cancer  quality of  life  ( QOL )  literature was conducted among studies that provided a comparison of mental , physical , social , or sexual QOL between  Latinas and other racial/ethnic groups .  Of the 375 studies review ed ,  20 quantitative studies and two qualitative studies  met criteria for inclusion . Results  Latinas  were more likely to report poor  mental , physical , and social QOL  , relative to non-Latinas  .  Only four studies assessed  sexual QOL  , making it difficult to draw any conclusions . Of these four QOL domains , the largest disparity was found in the area of mental health in which Latinas reported poorer  QOL  compared to non-Latina Whites and Blacks . Discussion / conclusions Most quantitative studies revealed either that Latinas consistently evidence d significantly lower  QOL  than non-Latinas on all measures ( 6 studies ) or reported mixed findings in which Latinas generally demonstrated significantly worse  QOL  on most , but not all , measures ( 12 studies ) included in the study . Explanatory mechanisms including socio-demographic , treatment-related , and culturally-relevant factors are discussed . Implication s for research design , measurement , and clinical work are also included . Implication s for cancer survivorsAlthough not entirely consistent , data suggest that  Latina  breast cancer survivors on average experience worse  QOL  than non-Latina Whites . Underst and ing ethnic differences in QOL among breast cancer survivors can inform interventions targeted at improving health status for Latinas."

"AThe purpose of this network meta- analysis was to identify the most effective bio material s producing  higher new bone formation ( NBF )  and lower  residual graft (  RG  )  and connective  tissue  ( CT ) following  maxillary sinus augmentation  ( MSA ) , and to generate a ranking based on their performance . The MEDLINE , Embase , and CENTRAL data bases were search ed to identify r and  omized controlled trials (  RCTs  )  published until March 2018 , evaluating histomorphometric outcomes after MSA . Predictor variables were   autogenous bone  ( AB ) , allografts ( AG ) , xenografts ( XG ) , alloplastic bone ( AP ) , AB+XG , AB+AP , AG+XG , XG+AP , and grafts combined with autologous platelet concentrates/recombinant growth factors , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) , or recombinant bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) .  Outcome variables were  NBF% , RG% , and CT% . Healing time  was considered . The weighted  mean  difference (  WMD  ) with  95 % confidence interval  ( CI ) was calculated via frequentist network meta- analysis using Stata software .  Fifty-two RCTs ( 1483 biopsies ) were included .  At a  healing time  < 6 months , AB was superior to AP ( WMD-10.66 % , 95 % CI-16.38 % to -4.94 % ) and XG ( WMD-7.93 % , 95 % CI-15.11 % to -0.75 % )  for NBF  . Regarding CT , AB was superior to XG+AP , AP , MSCs , and XG . At a  healing time ≥6 months , NBF  was higher for AB than AP ( WMD-7.06 % , 95 % CI-12.59 % to  -1.52 % ) . RG  was lower in AB than AP ( WMD 12.03 % , 95 % CI 3.04 % to 21.03 % ) , XG ( WMD 14.62 % , 95 % CI 4.25 % to 24.98 % ) , and growth factors ( WMD 12.32 % , 95 % CI 0.04 % to 24.60 % ) . The three highest ranked bio material s for  increasing NBF  were AG+XG ( 95 % , very low quality evidence ) , growth factors ( 69.9 % , low quality evidence ) , and AB alone ( 69.8 % , moderate quality evidence ) . The three highest ranked bio material s for  decreasing RG  were BMPs ( 88.8 % , very low quality evidence ) ,  AB  alone ( 81.5 % , moderate quality evidence ) , and  AB+AP  ( 58.9 % , very low quality evidence ) . Finally ,  XG+AP  ( 84.7 % , low quality evidence ) ,  AP  alone ( 77.7 % , moderate quality evidence ) , and MSCs ( 76.1 % , low quality evidence ) , were the three highest ranked bio material s for decreasing the amount of CT . Network meta- analysis provided moderate quality evidence that AB alone is probably the best option to obtain  greater  NBF after MSA in the first 6 months after surgery . Additionally , the results of this network meta- analysis support the hypothesis that osteoconductive bone substitute material s should be combined with osteogenic or osteoinductive grafts for superior  histomorphometric outcomes  in MSA."

" This review demonstrated that there was no additional benefit of using  NIPPV  in  postoperative pulmonary resection  for all outcomes analysed  ( pulmonary complications , rate of intubation , mortality , rate of non-pulmonary complications , postoperative consumption of antibiotics , length of intensive care unit stay , length of hospital stay and adverse effects  related to NIPPV ) . However , the quality of evidence is ' very low ' , ' low ' and ' moderate ' since there were few studies , with small sample size and low frequency of outcomes . New well- design ed and well-conducted r and omised trials are needed to answer the questions of this review with greater certainty."
"yBackground  Aerobic exercise  is a critical component of  cardiac rehabilitation following cardiac surgery .   Aerobic exercise  is traditionally commenced 2–6 weeks following hospital discharge and most commonly includes  stationary cycling  or  treadmill walking .  The initiation  of aerobic exercise  within this early postoperative period not only introduces the benefits associated with  aerobic activity  sooner , but also ameliorates the  negative effects of immobilization  associated with the early postoperative period . Methods A systematic review identified all studies reporting  safety and efficacy  outcomes of  aerobic exercise  commenced within two weeks of cardiac surgery . A meta- analysis was performed comparing  functional , aerobic and safety outcomes  in  patients receiving early postoperative  aerobic exercise  compared with usual postoperative care .   Results Six-minute walk test distance at hospital discharge  was 419 ± 88 m in  early aerobic exercise  patients versus 341 ± 81 m in those receiving usual care ( mean difference 69.5 m , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 39.2–99.7 m ,  p < 0.00001 ) . Peak aerobic power  was 18.6 ± 3.8 ml·kg–1·min–1 in those  receiving early exercise  versus 15.0 ± 2.1 ml·kg–1·min–1 in usual care ( mean difference 3.20 ml·kg–1·min–1 , 95 % CI 1.45–4.95 , p = 0.0003 ) . There was no significant difference  in adverse  events rates between the two groups ( odds ratio 0.41 , 95 % CI 0.12–1.42 , p = 0.16  )  .  Conclusion Aerobic exercise  commenced early after cardiac surgery  significantly improves functional and aerobic capacity  following cardiac surgery .  While  adverse event rates did not differ significantly ,  patients included were very low risk .  Further studies are required to adequately assess safety outcomes  of aerobic exercise  commenced early after cardiac surgery."
" This review only identified one small quasi-r and omised controlled trial of low quality and high risk of bias . The study provided limited data on only one of this review 's primary outcomes ,  breast milk production  , but the data were not reported in a format that permitted further analysis . The trialist reported that  extra fluids  did not improve breast  milk  production . However , this outcome was measured by using test feeds ( also known as test weighing ) . In the 1950s , when the study was conducted , it was common for babies in developed countries to be weighed before and after a feed , known as test  weighing  or test feeding  .  However , this practice is not now routinely practice d for  term infants  due to concerns about lack of precision as a measure of  breast milk production .  The included study did not report on this review 's other primary outcomes  ( satisfactory weight gain in the infant or duration of exclusive breastfeeding )  nor any of the review 's secondary outcomes .The effect of  additional fluids  for  breastfeeding mothers  remains unknown , due to a lack of well-conducted trials . However , because the physiological basis for any such improvement remains unclear , the conduct of further clinical trials may not be a priority . There is not enough evidence to support an increased  fluid intake  beyond what  breastfeeding mothers  are likely to require to meet their physiological needs."

"sIntroduction  Tracheostomy  is one of the more commonly performed procedures in  critically ill patients  yet the optimal method of performing tracheostomies in this population remains to be established . The aim of this study was to systematic ally review and quantitatively synthesize all r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) , comparing  elective percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( PDT )  and  surgical tracheostomy ( ST )  in  adult critically ill patients  with regards to major short and long term outcomes . Methods MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register data bases were search ed to identify relevant studies . Additionally , bibliographies and selected conference proceedings were review ed , and experts in the field and manufacturers of two PDT kits were contacted . R and omized clinical trials comparing any method of  elective PDT to ST  that included  critically ill adults  and reported at least one clinical ly relevant outcome were included . Data extracted included trial characteristics , measures of study validity , and clinical ly relevant outcomes . Results  Seventeen RCTs involving 1,212 patients were included  . Most  PDTs  used a multiple dilator technique and were performed in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) . The  pooled odds ratio ( OR ) for wound infection  was 0.28 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.16 to 0.49 , p < 0.0005 ) , indicating a significant reduction with  PDT  compared to ST . Overall ,  PDT  was equivalent to ST for  bleeding , major peri-procedural and long-term complications ;  however , subgroup analysis suggested  PDT  result ed in a lower incidence  of bleeding  ( OR = 0.29 ( 95 % CI 0.12 to 0.75 , p = 0.01 ) ) and  death  ( OR = 0.71 ( 95 % CI 0.50 to 1.0 , p = 0.05 ) ) when the STs were performed in the operating theatre . Conclusion  PDT  reduces the overall incidence  of wound infection  and may further reduce  clinical relevant bleeding and mortality  when compared with ST performed in the operating theatre .  PDT  , performed in the ICU , should be considered the procedure of choice for performing elective tracheostomies in critically ill adult patients."

"sAbstract A systematic review of r and  omized  controlled trials published from 1970–2002 was conducted to assess whether   specialized inpatient stroke rehabilitation   is associated with improved outcomes compared to  conventional care .   Twelve studies involving 2,813 patients  were included for detailed review . The method ological quality of the studies was assessed using the PEDro Scale . The outcomes of  death , functional outcome , length of hospital stay , and rates of institutionalization  were compared between the intervention and control group(s ) .  Improved functional outcomes and reduced length of hospital stays  were reported among  patients  receiving specialized rehabilitation in the majority of studies ( 7/12 and 5/8 , respectively ) , while no differences in  mortality or institutionalization  were reported between the groups."
"0BACKGROUND Nutrition in the first 1000 days between pregnancy and 24 months of life is critical for child health , and exclusive breastfeeding is promoted as the infant 's best source of nutrition in the first 6 months . Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant occurring naturally in some foods and used to treat primary apnoea in premature babies . However high caffeine intake can be harmful , and caffeine is transmitted into breastmilk . AIM To systematic ally review the evidence on the effects of  maternal caffeine consumption during breastfeeding on the breastfed child .  METHOD A systematic search was conducted to  October 2017 in MEDLINE , EMBASE , Web of Science , CINAHL  ,  and Cochrane Library .  The British Library catalogue , which covers doctoral theses , was search ed and PRISMA guidelines followed . Two review ers screened for experimental , cohort , or case-control studies and performed independent quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale . The main review er performed data extraction , checked by the second review er . RESULTS Two cohort , two crossover studies , and one N-of-1 trial were included for narrative synthesis . One crossover and two cohort studies of small sample sizes directly investigated maternal caffeine consumption . No significant effects on  24-hour heart rate , 24-hour sleep time , or frequent night waking  of the breastfed child were found . One study found a decreased  rate of full breastfeeding  at 6 months postpartum . Two studies indirectly investigated caffeine exposure . Maternal  chocolate and coffee  consumption was associated with increased  infant colic  , and  severe to moderate exacerbation of infant atopic dermatitis .  However , whether caffeine was the causal ingredient is question able . The insufficient and inconsistent evidence available had quality issues impeding conclusions on the effects of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed child .  Evidence for recommendations on caffeine intake for  breastfeeding women  is scant , of limited quality and inconclusive . Birth cohort studies investigating the potential positive and negative effects of various levels of maternal caffeine consumption on the  breastfed child and breastfeeding mother  could improve the knowledge base and allow evidence -based advice for  breastfeeding mothers  .

"dObjectives / background Given the widespread prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries , supplementation  with multiple micronutrients rather than iron-folate alone  , could be of potential benefit to the mother and the fetus . These benefits could relate to prevention of  maternal complications  and reduction in other  adverse pregnancy outcomes  such as  small-for-gestational age ( SGA ) births , low birth weight , stillbirths , perinatal and neonatal mortality .  This review evaluates the evidence of the impact of  multiple micronutrient supplements  during pregnancy , in comparison with  st and ard iron-folate supplements  , on specific  maternal and pregnancy  outcomes of relevance to the Lives Saved Tool ( LiST ) . Data sources / review methods A systematic review of r and omized controlled trials was conducted . Search engines used were PubMed , the Cochrane Library , the WHO regional data bases and h and search of bibliographies . A st and ardized data abstract ion and Child Health Epidemiology Reference ( CHERG ) adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) technique were used for data abstract ion and overall quality of evidence . Meta-analyses were performed to calculate summary estimates of utility to the LiST model for the specified outcome of incidence of SGA births . We also evaluated the potential impact of  multiple micronutrients  on  neonatal mortality  according to the proportion of deliveries occurring in facilities ( using a threshold of 60 % to indicate functionality of health systems for skilled births ) . Results We included  17 studies  for detailed data abstract ion . There was no significant benefit  of multiple micronutrients  as compared to  iron folate  on  maternal anemia  in third trimester [ Relative risk ( RR ) = 1.03 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.87 – 1.22 ( r and om model ) ] . Our analysis , however , showed a significant  reduction in SGA  by 9 % [ RR = 0.91 ; 95 % CI : 0.86 – 0.96 ( fixed model ) ] . In the fixed model ,  the  SGA outcome remained significant only in  women with mean body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 22 kg/m2 .  There was an  increased risk of neonatal mortality  in studies with majority of births at home [ RR = 1.47 , 95 % CI : 1.13 - 1.92 ] ; such an effect was not evident where ≥ 60 % of births occurred in facility setting s [ RR = 0.94 , 95 % CI : 0.81 - 1.09 ] . Overall there was no  increase  in  the risk of neonatal mortality  [ RR = 1.05 , 95 % CI  :  0.92 – 1.19 ( fixed model ) ] . Conclusion This review provides evidence of a significant benefit of  MMN supplementation  during pregnancy on reducing  SGA births  as compared to  iron-folate  , with no significant increase in the  risk of neonatal mortality  in population s where skilled birth care is available and majority of births take place in facilities . Given comparability of impacts on maternal anemia , the decision to replace  iron-folate with multiple micronutrients  during pregnancy may be taken in the context of available services in health systems and birth outcomes monitored."
 There is increasing evidence that psychostimulant trials provide evidence for  improvement in CRF  at a clinical ly meaningful level . There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of  methylpheni  date to confirm the preliminary results from this review . There is new safety data which indicates that the haemopoietic growth factors are associated with increased  adverse outcomes .  These drugs can no longer be recommended in the treatment of  CRF .

"eDespite a threefold increase in  treatment interventions  studies during the past 10 years , “ best practice ” for the rehabilitation of the  paretic upper limb  is still unclear . This review aims to lessen uncertainty in the management of the  poststroke upper limb . Two  separate search es of the scientific literature from  1966 - 2001 yielded 333 articles .  Three referees , using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria , selected 68 relevant references .  Cohort studies , r and omized control trials  , and  systematic review  s were critically appraised . Mean r and omized control trial quality ( n = 33 ) was 17.1/27 ( SD = 5.2 , 95 % CI = 15.2–19.0 , range = 6–26 ) .  Mean  quality of cohort studies ( n = 29 ) was 11.8/27 ( SD = 3.8 , 95 % CI = 10.4–13.2 , range = 4–19 ) . Quantitative syntheses were done using theZ-statistic . This systematic review indicated that  sensorimotor training ; motor learning training  that includes the  use of imagery , electrical stimulation alone , or combined with biofeedback ;  and engaging the client in repetitive , novel tasks can be  effective  in  reducing motor impairment  after stroke . Furthermore , careful h and ling , electrical stimulation , movement with elevation , strapping , and the avoidance of overhead pulleys could  effectively reduce or prevent pain  in the paretic upper limb . Rehabilitation specialists can use this research synthesis to guide their selection of effective treatment techniques for persons with impairments after stroke."

"yObesity is an asthma common comorbidity and is associated not only with its development , but also with a poorer control and higher severity of it . Recent prospect i ve evidence supports the idea that  body weight gain  precedes the development of asthma , but the debate is far from over . The objective of this document is to conduct a systematic review of 3 clinical questions related to asthma and obesity : 1 . Obesity and asthma : the chicken or the egg ? Clinical insights from epidemiological and phenotypes studies . 2 . Is obesity a confounding factor in the diagnosis and management of asthma and especially in severe or difficult-to-control asthma ? 3 . How  obese asthma subjects  respond to pharmacological treatments , and to  biological drugs  ? Do we have effective specific interventions ? . Revised epidemiological , pathological and mechanistic evidence combined with data from the intervention clinical trials do not allow us to clearly state that obesity is an asthma-causative agent . However , the complexity and heterogeneity of these two illnesses make several clinical scenarios possible . Furthermore , the diagnosis of  asthma  in an  obese patient  represents an additional clinical challenge . Physicians need to be aware of the confounding effects created by the greater symptomatic perception , the alterations of  lung function  and the different comorbidities that the obese subjects present . A exhaustive phenotyping of the  obese asthma patient  should lead us to a rational therapeutic plan , including both ,  the pharmacological approach and anti-obesity specific therapies including a combined plan of diet and exercise and  in  extreme cases  , bariatric surgery."
"1Background :  Perimenopausal depressive disorder  (  PDD  ) is a disease that plagues  many perimenopausal women .  There is an urgent need for a safe way to treat the disease . With few side effects ,  acupuncture  treatment for PDD has been gradually accepted . However , at present , the evidence is insufficient and relevant studies are not in-depth enough . The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of  acupuncture  for PDD . Methods : All r and omized controlled trials articles on  acupuncture treatment  of PDD will be search ed in data bases such as MEDLINE , EBASE , Cochrane Library , Springer , World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform , China National Knowledge Infrastructure , Wan Fang , Chinese Biomedical Literature Data base , Chinese Scientific Journal Data base and so on . Non- RCT articles will be screened and key information will be extracted . The primary outcome is the  Hamilton depression scale .  Second outcomes are the  Hamilton anxiety scale , Quality of life scale , changes of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine and hormone levels .  Results : This systematic review will provide the highest level of evidence and provide an evaluation of the  efficacy  and  safety  of  acupuncture  for PDD . Conclusion : This study provides evidence for evaluating the efficacy and safety of  acupuncture  in the treatment of PDD . PROSPERO registration number : CRD42018115811."
" The review question remains unanswered as there were no r and omised trials of methods of communicating  a diagnosis of breast  cancer   to  women .  The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to r and omise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis . The design of ethically sensitive research to examine this topic needs to be explored to inform future practice . As some papers review ed by the authors related to the first consultation visit , where treatment options are discussed , perhaps a review which focused on the methods of  communication  at the first consultation visit would provide more reliable evidence for the effectiveness of methods of communication and overcome the ethical dilemmas previously mentioned."
"nUNLABELLED Research es have accumulated using  non-pharmacologic interventions including acupoint stimulation , massage therapy and expressive writing  to manage  breast cancer-related symptoms .  Results from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) can get contradictory . OBJECTIVE A systematic review and meta- analysis were conducted to determine the effects on the  quality of life , negative emotions and disease-related symptoms  among  women with breast cancer .  METHODS  Two independent research ers  performed a structured search using data sources including MEDLINE , CINAHL , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , EMBASE , PubMed and PsychINFO from the beginning  of time until the first week of January 2015 .  A total  of 23  acupoint stimulation , massage therapy and expressive writing RCTs  were included in  the review . RESULTS The study showed that no single intervention could be put under the spotlight exhibiting an overall effective result on all measured outcomes ; however , looking into each one in detail shows different results in specific outcomes . Among the three interventions ,  acupoint  stimulation has a treatment effect for  general pain  ( MD=-1.46 , 95 % CI=-2.38 to -0.53 ) and  fatigue  ( MD=-2.22 , 95 % CI=-3.68 to -0.77 ) ,  massage therapy  has a treatment effect for  anxiety  ( MD=-0.50 , 95 % CI=-0.77 to -0.24 ) , and expressive writing has a treatment effect for  quality of life  ( MD=7.18 , 95 % CI=0.38 to 13.98 ) . The measurement other outcomes showed either ineffective or equivocal results .   Non-pharmacologic interventions including acupoint stimulation , massage therapy and expressive writing  have an effect on a  middle-age woman with breast cancer .  However , because of limitations , the seemingly promising results should be interpreted with caution."
" According to the currently available data ,  PRP injections  are beneficial  for pain relief and function improvement  in  patients with OA .  This meta- analysis , however , demonstrated that the efficacy of  PRP  is related to sample size and gender composition . Thus , more r and omised controlled trials of high quality and larger patient size , also including gender aspects , are required to underst and this phenomenon . The translational potential of this article The translation potential of this meta- analysis is that provided another perspective to analyse the treatment effect  of PRP  for OA . In future research , phenotypes sub population and gender difference of  OA patient  should be considered for  PRP  treatment."

">To evaluate the potential added benefit of the topical application of  hyaluronic acid ( HA )  on the clinical outcomes  following  non-surgical or surgical periodontal therapy .   A systematic search was performed in Medline , Embase , Cochrane , Web of Science , Scopus and Grey literature data bases . The literature search was preformed according to PRISMA guidelines . The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used in order to assess the methodology of the included trials .  Weighted mean differences ( WMDs )  and 95 %  confidence intervals (  CIs ) between the treatment and controls were estimated using the r and om-effect model for  amount of bleeding on probing ( BOP ) , probing depth ( PD ) reduction and clinical attachment level ( CAL ) gain .  In order to minimize the bias and to perform meta- analysis , only r and omized clinical studies ( RCTs ) were selected .  Thirteen RCTs were included : 11 on  non-surgical periodontal treatment  and two on  surgical periodontal treatment .   Overall analysis  of PD reduction , CAL gain and BOP reduction  in  non-surgical therapy  with  adjunctive HA  presented WMD of − 0.36 mm ( 95 % CI − 0.54 to − 0.19 mm ; p < 0.0001 ) , 0.73 mm ( 95 % CI 0.28 to 1.17 mm ; p < 0.0001 ) and − 15 % ( 95 % CI − 22 to − 8 % ; p < 0.001 ) respectively , favouring the application  of HA  . The overall  analysis on PD and CAL gain  in surgical therapy with  adjunctive HA  presented WMD of − 0.89 mm ( 95 % CI − 1.42 to − 0.36 mm ; p < 0.0001 )  for PD  reduction and 0.85 mm ( 95 % CI 0.08 to 1.62 mm ; p < 0.0001 )  for CAL  gain after 6–24 months favouring the treatment  with HA .  However , comparison presented considerable heterogeneity between the non-surgical studies and a high risk of bias in general . Within their limits , the present data indicate that the topical application  of HA  may lead to additional clinical benefits when used as an adjunctive to non-surgical and surgical periodontal therapy . However , due to the high risk of bias and heterogeneity , there is a need for further well- design ed RCTs to evaluate this material in various clinical scenarios . The adjunctive use  of HA  may improve the clinical outcomes when used in conjunction with  non-surgical  and surgical  periodontal therapy ."
"sCONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE  Preoperative glucocorticoid administration  has been proposed for reducing  postoperative morbidity .  This is not widely used before esophageal resection because of incomplete knowledge regarding its effectiveness . The aim here was to assess the effects of  preoperative glucocorticoid administration  in  adults undergoing esophageal resection for esophageal carcinoma .  SEARCH STRATEGY Studies were identified by search ing the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cancer Lit , SCIELO and Cochrane Library , and by manual search ing from relevant articles . The last search for clinical trials for this systematic review was performed in December 2004 . SELECTION CRITERIA This review included  r and omized studies of patients with potentially resectable carcinomas of the esophagus  that compared  preoperative glucocorticoid administration with placebo .  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted by the same review ers , and the trial quality was assessed using Jadad scoring  .  Relative risk and weighted mean difference with 95 % confidence limits were used to assess the significance of the difference between the treatment arms . RESULTS  Four r  and  omized trials involving 146 patients  were found . There were no differences in  postoperative mortality , sepsis , anastomotic leakage , hepatic and renal failure  between the  glucocorticoid  and  placebo  groups . There were fewer  postoperative respiratory complications  ( p = 0.005 ) and  multiple postoperative complications  ( p = 0.004 ) and lower  postoperative plasma interleukin-6 levels  ( p = 0.00001 ) with preoperative  glucocorticoid  administration . There was a higher  postoperative PaO2/FiO2 ratio  ( p = 0.0001 ) with preoperative  glucocorticoid  administration .  Prophylactic administration of  glucocorticoids  is associated with decreased postoperative complications."
"dMen  with prostate cancer  are likely to have a long illness and experience psychological distress for which supportive care may be helpful . This systematic review describes the evidence for  effectiveness  and  cost-effectiveness  of  supportive care  for  men with prostate cancer  , taking into account treatment pathway and components of interventions . MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , CENTRAL , and Psychinfo were search ed from inception -- July 2013 for r and omized controlled trials and controlled trials . Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data .  Twenty-six studies were included ( 2740 participants ) .  Interventions were delivered pre and during ( n = 12 ) , short-term ( n = 8) , and longer term ( 18 months ) ( n = 5 ) after primary treatment . No interventions were delivered beyond this time . Few trials  recruited ethnic minorities and none recruited men in same sex relationships .  Intervention components included  information , education , health professional discussion , homework , peer discussion , buddy support , cognitive behavioral therapy , cognitive restructuring , psychoeducation , Reiki and relaxation .  Most interventions were delivered for 5 - 10 weeks . Risk of bias of trials was assessed as unclear for most domains due to lack of information . The majority of trials measuring  quality of life and depression  found no effect . Relatively few trials measured  anxiety , coping skills and self-efficacy  , and the majority found no effect . No cost data were available . Trials of supportive care for  men with prostate cancer  cover a range of interventions but are limited by population diversity , inconsistent measurement and reporting of outcomes , and inability to assess risk of bias . Recommendations on design and conduct of future trials are presented."
" : Sham-controlled RCTs have found no benefits of  acupuncture  relative to a credible sham  acupuncture  control on  IBS symptom severity or IBS-related quality of life .  In comparative effectiveness Chinese trials , patients reported greater benefits from  acupuncture  than from  pharmacological therapies .  Future trials may help clarify whether or not these reportedly greater benefits of  acupuncture  relative to  pharmacological therapies  are due entirely to patients ' preferences for  acupuncture  or patients ' greater expectations of improvement on  acupuncture  relative to drugs."

"dLimited evidence exists about how to design interventions to improve  access  to  health care  for  people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) .  This paper documents the development of two behaviour change interventions . Case study one outlines the design of an intervention to improve uptake of referral for ear  and  hearing services  for children in Malawi .  Case study two describes the design of an  intervention to improve  menstrual hygiene  management   for people with intellectual impairments in Nepal .  Both followed existing approaches-Medical Research Council Guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions and Behaviour Centred Design . The purpose is to demonstrate how these frameworks can be applied , to document the interventions developed , and encourage further initiatives to advance health services targeting  people with disabilities .  Important components of the intervention design process were : ( 1 ) systematic review s and formative research ensure that interventions design ed are relevant to current discourse , practice and context ; ( 2 )  people with disabilities and their family/carers  must be at the heart of the process ; ( 3 ) applying the theory of change approach and testing it helps underst and links between inputs and required behaviour change , as well as ensuring that the interventions are relevant to local context s ; ( 4 ) involving creative experts may lead to the development of more engaging and appealing interventions . Further evidence is needed on the  effectiveness  of these types of interventions for  people with disabilities  to ensure that no one is left behind."

"nAIM To perform a systematic review to determine the  survival  outcomes after  curative resection  of  intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinomas ( HCC ) .  METHODS A systematic review of the published literature was performed using the PubMed data base from 1st January 1999 to  31st  Dec 2014 to identify studies that reported outcomes of  liver resection  as the primary curative treatment for  Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stage B or C HCC .  The primary end point was to determine the  overall survival ( OS ) and disease free survival ( DFS )  of  liver resection  of  HCC in BCLC stage B or C in patients with adequate liver reserve ( i.e. , Child ’s A or B status ) .  The secondary end points were to assess  the morbidity and mortality  of   liver  resection  in large HCC ( defined as lesions larger than 10 cm in diameter ) and to compare  the OS and DFS  after  surgical resection  of solitary vs multifocal HCC . RESULTS We identified  74 articles which met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed  in this systematic review . Analysis of the resection outcomes of the included studies were grouped according to ( 1 ) BCLC stage B or C HCC , ( 2 ) Size of HCC and ( 3 ) multifocal tumors . The median  5-year  OS of BCLC stage B was 38.7 % ( range 10.0 - 57.0 ) ; while the median 5-year OS of BCLC stage C was 20.0 % ( range 0.0 - 42.0 ) . The collective  median 5-year OS  of both stages was 27.9 % ( 0.0 - 57.0 ) . In examining the  morbidity and mortality  following liver resection in large HCC , the pooled RR for  morbidity  [ RR ( 95%CI ) = 1.00 ( 0.76 - 1.31 ) ] and  mortality  [ RR ( 95%CI ) = 1.15 ( 0.73 - 1.80 ) ] were not significant . Within the spectrum of BCLC B and C lesions , tumors greater than 10 cm were reported to have median 5-year OS of 33.0 % and multifocal lesions 54.0 % .  Indication for surgical resection should be extended to BCLC stage B lesions  in selected patients .  Further studies are needed to stratify stage C lesions for resection."
"  Infants who are  exclusively breastfed  for six months  experience less  morbidity from gastrointestinal infection  than those who are  partially breastfed  as of three or four months , and no deficits have been demonstrated in growth among infants from either developing or developed countries who are exclusively breastfed for six months or longer . Moreover , the mothers of such infants have more prolonged  lactational amenorrhea .  Although infants should still be managed individually so that insufficient growth or other adverse outcomes are not ignored and appropriate interventions are provided , the available evidence demonstrates no apparent risks in recommending , as a general policy ,  exclusive breastfeeding  for the first six months of life in both developing and developed-country setting."

"yOBJECTIVE Disease activity of  rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patients  was often measured by the  28-joint count disease activity score ( DAS-28 )  , which consists of 28  swollen and tender joint counts , patient 's assessment of disease activity ( visual analog scale [ VAS ] )  and  erythrocyte sedimentation rate .  C-reactive protein was also used to measure disease activity in  RA patients .  The aim was to explore the impact of  medication adherence  on disease activity in  patients with RA .  METHODS A systematic search was performed in major electronic data bases ( PubMed ,  Web  of  Science  , the  Cochrane Library  ,  CNKI  ,  VIP  and  Wan fang  ) to identify studies reporting  medication adherence  and disease activity in  RA patients .  Results were expressed as mean difference ( MD ) and 95 % CI . RESULTS A total of  seven identified studies  matched the inclusion criteria  , reporting on a total of 1,963 adult RA patients in the analysis .  The  total score of DAS-28  was significantly lower in adherent patients than in nonadherent subjects ( MD = -0.42 , 95 % CI [ -0.80 , -0.03 ] , P=0.03 ) . Similarly , a significant difference was observed between medication adherent and nonadherent groups in  erythrocyte sedimentation rate  ( MD = -7.39 , 95 % CI [ -11.69 , -3.08 ] , P<0.01 ) and  tender joint count  ( MD = -1.29 , 95 % CI [ -2.51 , -0.06 ] , P=0.04 ) . Interestingly , the results of the meta- analysis showed no significant difference between medication adherent and nonadherent patients in  swollen joint count  ( MD = -0.16 , 95 % CI [ -2.13 , 1.80 ] , P=0.87 ) ,  visual analog scale  ( MD = 1.41 , 95 % CI [ -3.68 , 6.50 ] , P=0.59 ) and  C-reactive protein  ( MD = 0.35 , 95 % CI [ -0.64 , 1.34 ] , P=0.49 ) .  The study suggests  that RA patients with higher medication adherence  tended to have lower disease activity."
" There are no published RCTs or quasi- RCTs that examine whether  physical rehabilitation interventions  improve  activities of daily living  for people with  CIP and  CIM .

" There is currently limited evidence from RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of  protocol -directed sedation  on patient outcomes . The four included RCTs reported conflicting results and heterogeneity limited the interpretation of results for the primary outcomes of  duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality .  Further studies , taking into account differing context ual characteristics , are necessary to inform future practice . Method ological strategies to reduce the risk of bias need to be considered in future studies."
" The single included study suggested that  calcium  supplementation before and early in pregnancy may reduce the risk of women experiencing the composite outcome  pre-eclampsia or pregnancy loss at any gestational age  , but the results are inconclusive for all other outcomes for women and babies . Therefore , current evidence neither supports nor refutes the routine use of  calcium supplementation  before conception and in early pregnancy . To determine the overall benefit of  calcium supplementation  commenced before or in early pregnancy , the effects found in the study of  calcium supplementation  limited to the first half of pregnancy need to be added to the known benefits of  calcium  supplementation in the second half of pregnancy . Further research is needed to confirm whether initiating  calcium supplementation  pre- or in early pregnancy is associated with a reduction in  adverse pregnancy outcomes  for mother and baby . Research could also address the  acceptability of the  intervention to women , which was not covered by this review up date."
"sOur purpose was to determine the  effectiveness  and harms of  vaccination  in  patients with any sexual history to prevent the prevalence of papillomavirus infection .  A search strategy was conducted in the MEDLINE , CENTRAL , EMBASE and LILACS data bases . Search es were also conducted in other data bases and unpublished literature . The risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool . Analysis of fixed effects was conducted . The primary outcome was the  infection by any and each human papillomavirus ( HPV ) genotype , serious adverse effects and short-term adverse effects .  The measure of the effect was the  risk difference ( RD )  with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . The planned interventions were  bivalent vaccine/tetravalent/nonavalent vs. placebo/no intervention/other vaccines .  We included  29 studies described in 35 publications .   Bivalent HPV vaccine  offers protection against  HPV16  ( RD -0.05 , 95 % CI -0.098 to -0.0032 ) ,  HPV18  ( RD -0.03 , 95 % CI -0.062 to -0.0004 ) and  HPV16/18  genotypes ( RD of -0.1 , 95 % CI -0.16 to -0.04 ) . On the other side , tetravalent HPV vaccine offered protection against  HPV6  ( RD of -0.0500 , 95 % CI -0.0963 to -0.0230 ) ,  HPV11  ( RD -0.0198 , 95 % CI -0.0310 to -0.0085 ) . Also , against  HPV16  ( RD of -0.0608 , 95 % CI -0.1126 to -0.0091 ) and  HPV18  ( RD of -0.0200 , 95 % CI -0.0408 to -0.0123 ) . There was a reduction in the  prevalence of HPV16 , 18 and 16/18 genotypes  when applying the bivalent vaccine , with  no increase in adverse effects .  Regarding the tetravalent vaccine , we found a reduction in the  prevalence of HPV6 , 11 , 16 and 18 genotypes  , with no increase in adverse effects."
"sBackground  Supportive care interventions  can have a substantial impact on side effects of chemotherapy . Consequently , accurate reporting of such interventions is essential when interpreting clinical trial results . This study determined the prevalence and quality of reporting of  supportive care treatment  for common chemotherapy-induced toxicities in phase III  , breast cancer chemotherapy trials .  Methods A systematic review of phase III trials of  breast cancer trials incorporating  chemotherapy  published in the last 5 years  was undertaken . Trials were identified through MEDLINE , EMBASE , BIOSIS , and the Cochrane Library . Supportive treatments evaluated were  use of  antiemetics , colony-stimulating growth factors  , and  antibiotics  .  Reporting quality was rated as “ good ” , “ fair ” , “ poor ” , or “ absent ” using predetermined criteria . Results  Sixty-two trials met inclusion criteria .  In 41 studies ( 66 % ) , details regarding   prophylactic antiemetic treatment   were not provided .  Growth factor use  was not reported in 20 trials ( 32 % ) . Instructions for the use of  prophylactic antibiotics  were absent in 45 trials ( 72 % ) . Conclusion There are significant deficiencies in reporting of use of  prophylactic supportive care agents  in  breast cancer trials .  Omission of supportive care instructions may impact substantially on patient management and health care system expenditure . Recommendations for the type , dose , and frequency of  supportive care drugs  should be provided and reported on in trials."

In clinical trials or prospect i ve series , discontinuation and washout of PGAs is necessary to evaluate true change in IOP from novel surgeries and medical therapies . Clinical Relevance To identify all relevant papers with pertinent data on washout of PGAs and quantify the duration and long-term effect of reported PGA washout periods in  glaucoma and OHT patients .  Methods A systematic review and meta- analysis was conducted to investigate the long-term  effects on IOP  after discontinuation of topical PGAs POAG and OHT patients . The main search was conducted in MEDLINE / PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , CINAHL , Web of Science , and BIOSIS P review s and conference proceedings . Results  1055 papers were identified , 548 were independently screened by two physicians .  , and  56  papers were analyzed for washout duration s. The  mean washout  was found to be 4.56 weeks ( ±1.25 ) , with the mode and median being 5 weeks . Five studies were analyzed as r and omized control trials in which latanoprost was discontinued for 4 weeks prior to restarting another intraocular pressure-lowering drug . Meta- analysis revealed a 4-week discontinuation of latanoprost , on average , subjects returned to their baseline IOP . Conclusion A  significant IOP-lowering effect  of latanoprost was not observed beyond 4 weeks , suggesting this may be an appropriate washout period for latanoprost . We could not identify appropriate washout periods for either travoprost or bimatoprost , although a majority of articles had 4-week washout duration s for the two drugs . Despite the widespread use of this class of medication , there is a paucity of literature on the effects of  PGA  washout in patients that are treatment naïve to other topical medications."
"nBACKGROUND Arthritis is a syndrome associated with exacerbated inflammation , joint destruction and chronic pain and disability . Chronic treatment of arthritis is associated with several side effects and high ab and onment . Therefore , there has been an ongoing search for alternative treatments to overcome these problems . PURPOSE Natural products , which are already widely used for their biological , cosmetic and pharmacotechnic properties , are a possible source for new drugs . Terpenes , a large class of organic compounds produced mainly by plants and trees , are a promising natural product and have already been shown to be effective in treating  chronic  pain , particularly of an inflammatory origin . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This review identifies the main terpenes with  anti-arthritic activity  reported in the last 10 years . A survey was conducted between December 2017 and June 2018 in the PUBMED , SCOPUS and Science Direct data bases using combinations of the descriptors terpenes , arthritis and inflammation . RESULTS The results showed that terpenes have  promising biological effects  in relation to the treatment of arthritis , with the 24 terpenes identified in our survey being  effective  in the  modulation of inflammatory mediators  important to the physiopathology of arthritis , such  as IL-6 , IL-17 , TNF-α , NFκB , and COX-2  , among  others  . It is important to note that most of the studies used  animal models  , which limits , at least in part , the direct translation to humans of the experimental evidence produced by the studies .  Together , our finds suggest that terpenes can modulate the  immuno-regulatory and destructive tissue  events that underlie the clinical presentation and the progression of arthritis and are worthy of further clinical investigation."
"sThe number of people living with and  beyond  cancer is at an all time high . These survivors are not necessarily living well , as adverse side effects from cancer and its treatment can last up to 5 years and leave patients at a higher risk of developing secondary cancers and other chronic illnesses .  Exercise  has been proven to be a safe and effective method of intervention to decrease mortality and overall improve health  outcomes  . The biological mechanism through which this occurs is an area of research that is in its infancy and not well defined . A systematic search was conducted of four data bases for relevant r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) published between January 2004 and December 2014 . Studies had to include any  blood/urine biological markers  as an outcome measure to a  physical activity intervention  for cancer survivors posttreatment .  Fifteen relevant articles were identified  ( 12 RCTs ) . It was shown that r and omized controlled trials  of exercise  for cancer survivors posttreatment may results in changes  to circulating levels of insulin , insulin related pathways ( insulin like growth factor II [ IGF II ] , IGF binding protein 3 ) , high density lipoprotein , total cholesterol , leptin , and osteocalcin .  Due to small sample sizes , the evidence is still preliminary and therefore more research is warranted in this area in the form of larger , statistically powered RCTs for cancer survivors."
" The coding of theory in these studies suggested that theory was not often used extensively in the development of interventions . Moreover , the relationships between type of theory used and the extent of theory use with  effectiveness  were generally weak . The findings suggest that attempts to apply the two theories commonly used in this review more extensively are unlikely to increase intervention effectiveness."
"gBackground  Adolescents living with chronic illnesses  engage in health risk behaviors ( HRB ) which pose challenges for optimizing care and management of their ill health . Frequent monitoring of HRB is recommended , however little is known about which are the most useful tools to detect HRB among  chronically ill adolescents .  Aims This systematic review was conducted to address important knowledge gaps on the assessment of HRB among  chronically ill adolescents .  Its specific aims were to : identify  HRB assessment tools  , the geographical location of the studies , their means of administration , the psychometric properties of the tools and the commonest forms of HRB assessed among  adolescents living with chronic illnesses  globally . Methods We search ed in four bibliographic data bases of PubMed , Embase , PsycINFO and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstract s for empirical studies published until April 2017 on  HRB among chronically ill adolescents aged 10–17 years .  Results This review indicates a major dearth of research on HRB among  chronically ill adolescents especially in low income setting  s. The  Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System  and Health Behavior in School-aged Children were the commonest HRB assessment tools . Only 21 % of the eligible studies reported  psychometric properties of the HRB tools or items . Internal consistency  was good and varied from 0.73 to 0.98 whereas  test – retest reliability  varied from unacceptable ( 0.58 ) to good ( 0.85 ) . Numerous methods of tool administration were also identified  . Alcohol , tobacco and other drug use and physical inactivity  are the commonest forms of HRB assessed . Conclusion Evidence on the suitability of the majority of the  HRB assessment tools  has so far been documented in  high income setting  s where most of them have been developed . The utility of such tools in low re source setting s is often hampered by the cultural and context ual variations across regions . The  psychometric qualities  were good but only reported in a minority of studies from  high  income setting s. This result points to the need for more re sources and capacity building for tool adaptation and validation , so as to enhance research on HRB  among chronically ill adolescents  in low re source setting."

">Purpose of this review is to systematic ally assess the effects on  voice and speech  of  advanced head and neck cancer  and its treatment by means of  chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) .  The data bases Medline , Embase and Cochrane were search ed ( 1991–2009 ) for terms head and neck cancer , chemoradiation , voice and speech rehabilitation .  Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria  , whereof 14 reported on  voice outcomes  and 10 on  speech .  Within the selected 20 studies , 18 different tools were used for  speech or voice evaluation .  Most studies assessed their data by means of  patient question  naires . Four studies presented outcome measures in more than one dimension . Most studies summarised the outcomes of posttreatment data that were assessed at various points in time after treatment . Except for four studies , pre-treatment measurements were lacking . This and the fact that most studies combined the outcomes of  patients with radiated laryngeal cancers  with outcome data of  non-laryngeal cancer patients  impedes an interpretation in terms of the effects of radiation versus the effects of the disease itself on  voice or speech .  Overall , the studies indicated that  voice and speech degenerated  during  CRT  , improved again 1–2 months after treatment and exceeded pre-treatment levels after 1 year or longer .  However , voice and speech measures  do not show normal values before or after treatment . Given the large-ranged posttreatment data , missing baseline assessment and the lacking separation of tumour/radiation sites , there is an urgent need for structured st and ardised multi-dimensional speech and voice assessment protocol s in  patients with advanced head and neck cancer  treated with  CRT ."
" A review of the published evidence found that one trial reported  gemcitabine plus cisplatin  had a better  safety profile  than  MVAC  and may be considered the first choice for treatment of metastatic bladder cancer . However , the data are limited to one trial only . Patients unable to tolerate cisplatin may benefit from gemcitabine plus carboplatin."
">Total  dietary fat intake  might influence the  risk  of fracture  ;  however , conflicting findings have been reported to date . Moreover , the type of fatty acids is also of vital importance . We aim ed to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the association between  dietary fat intake  , saturated fatty acids ( SFAs ) , monounsaturated fatty acids ( MUFAs ) , and the  risk  of fracture  .  PubMed and Scopus were used to conduct a comprehensive search for  articles published up to 7 January 2018 .  To pool effect sizes , r and om effects models ( the DerSimonian-Laird method ) were applied . The Cochrane Q test was used to trace the source of between- study heterogeneity .  Six studies met inclusion criteria for meta- analysis .  We found no significant association between  total dietary fat intake and risk of fracture  ( pooled effect size 1.31 , 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) 0.95–1.79 , P = 0.09 ) . A significant positive association was observed  between SFA intake and the risk of hip fracture  ( pooled effect size 1.79 , 95 % CI 1.05–3.03 , P = 0.03 ) . There was also a significant  positive association between MUFAs  derived from  animal sources and the risk of fracture  ( pooled effect size 2.29 , 95 % CI 1.50–3.50 , P < 0.0001 ) . Our findings showed a strong positive  association between SFAs intake and risk of hip fracture  . Moreover , there was a significant positive  association between MUFAs  derived from animal sources and  the risk of fracture ."
"yPurpose To determine the effectiveness and harms of  bladder-preserving trimodal therapy ( TMT )  as a first-line treatment versus  radical cystectomy ( RC ) plus radical pelvic lymphadenectomy  in the treatment of  muscle-invasive bladder cancer  in terms of overall  survival  . Methods We included parallel clinical trials and prospect i ve and retrospective cohort studies that included  patients older than 18 years old , diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer , who underwent  TMT  compared with  RC .   The planned comparison was  TMT  versus  RC  plus  pelvic lymphadenectomy  as first-line treatment . The primary outcome was  overall survival ( OS )  and secondary outcomes were  salvage cystectomy and cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival .  A search strategy was design ed for MEDLINE , CENTRAL , Embase , and LILACS . We saturated information with conference abstract s , in progress clinical trials , literature published in non-indexed journals , and other sources of gray literature . St and ardized tools assessed the risk of bias independently . We performed the statistical analysis in R v3.4.1 and effect sizes were reported in terms of hazard ratios ( HR ) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( 95%CI ) . Accordingly , we used a r and om effect model due to the statistical heterogeneity found in included studies . Results We found  2682 records with the search strategies  and ,  finally  ,  11 studies were included  in the quantitative  analysis  . The  summary HR for OS  was 1.06 95%CI ( 0.85–1.31 ) I2 = 77 % , showing no statistical difference . Regarding  cancer-specific survival  , the summary HR was 1.23 95%CI ( 1.04–1.46 ) I2 = 14 % . On the other side , for  the progression-free survival  , the summary HR was 1.11 95%CI ( 0.63–1.95 ) I2 = 78 % . Only one study  described HR for adverse events  ( 1.37 95%CI 1.16–1.59 ) . Conclusion We found no differences in  overall survival and progression-free survival  between these two interventions . Nonetheless , we found that  cancer-specific survival  favored patients who received radical cystectomy."
"oThe intake of  omega-6 vegetable oils , particularly soybean oil  , began to increase in the  USA  starting in the early 1900s at a time when the consumption of  butter and lard  was on the decline.1 This caused a more than two-fold increase in the intake of  linoleic acid  , the main omega-6  polyunsaturated  fat found in vegetable oils , which now makes up around 8 % to 10 % of total energy intake in the Western world . The  omega-6 fat linoleic acid  should not be confused with conjugated linoleic acid found in pastured animal foods . A systematic review of studies measuring the changes  in linoleic acid concentration  in subcutaneous adipose tissue in the  USA  revealed an approximate 2.5-fold increase in linoleic acid increasing from 9.1 % to 21.5 % from 1959 to 2008.2 Importantly , the concentration of  linoleic acid in adipose tissue  is a reliable marker of intake as the half-life of linoleic acid is approximately 2 years in adipose tissue . The authors of the study also noted that the  increase in adipose tissue linoleic  paralleled the increase in the  prevalence of diabetes , obesity and asthma.2  The  amount of linoleic acid in adipose tissue  , but also  in platelets  , is additionally positively associated with  coronary artery disease ( CAD )  , whereas long-chain  omega-3 ( eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ) levels in  platelets are inversely related to CAD.3 This provides rather compelling evidence that omega-3s protect whereas omega-6 linoleic  acid   promotes heart disease  . Importantly , the increased consumption of  omega-6 polyunsaturated fat linoleic acid  can reduce omega-3 in the body as it competes with the alpha-linolenic acid for metabolism to longer chain polyunsaturated fats . It has been known for decades that linoleic acid , as a percentage of total fatty acids in lipids , is reduced in  patients with  CAD , and this has been used as an argument to."
"eBACKGROUND  Oral vaccines  underperform in  low-income and middle-income countries  compared with in  high-income countries .  Whether interventions can improve oral vaccine performance is uncertain . METHODS We did a systematic review and meta- analysis of interventions design ed to increase  oral vaccine efficacy  or immunogenicity . We search ed Ovid- MEDLINE and Embase for trials published until Oct 23 , 2017 . Inclusion criteria for meta- analysis were  two or more studies per  intervention category  and available seroconversion data  . We did r and om-effects meta-analyses to produce summary relative risk ( RR ) estimates . This study is registered with PROSPERO ( CRD42017060608 ) . FINDINGS Of  2843 studies identified , 87 were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 66 for meta- analysis .  22 different interventions were assessed for  oral poliovirus vaccine ( OPV ) , oral rotavirus vaccine ( RVV ) , oral cholera vaccine ( OCV ) , and oral typhoid vaccines .  There was generally high heterogeneity  . Seroconversion to RVV  was significantly increased by delaying the first RVV dose by 4 weeks ( RR 1·37 , 95 % CI 1·16 - 1·62 )  and OPV seroconversion  was increased with monovalent or bivalent OPV compared with trivalent OPV ( RR 1·51 , 95 % CI 1·20 - 1·91 ) . There was some evidence that separating RVV and OPV  increased RVV seroconversion  ( RR 1·21 , 95 % CI 1·00 - 1·47 ) and that higher vaccine inoculum  improved OCV seroconversion  ( RR 1·12 , 95 % CI 1·00 - 1·26 ) . There was no evidence of effect for anthelmintics , antibiotics , probiotics , zinc , vitamin A , withholding breastfeeding , extra doses , or vaccine buffering . INTERPRETATION Most strategies did not  improve oral vaccine performance  .  Delaying  RVV and  reducing  OPV valence should be considered within immunisation programmes to reduce global enteric disease . New strategies to address the gap in oral vaccine efficacy are urgently required .

" The studies were heterogeneous , and included  participants at risk of a variety of illnesses .  In many cases the intervention was compared to  usual care for an individual or an individual-focused intervention  , which meant the impact of the couplebased content could not be isolated . Three arm studies could determine whether any added benefits of  couple-focused interventions  are due to adding the partner or specific content of  couple-focused interventions .  Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject ?  Health behaviours and health behaviour change  are more often concordant across couples than between individuals in the general population .  Couple-focused interventions  for chronic conditions are more  effective  than individual  interventions  or usual care ( Martire , Schulz , Helgeson , Small , & Saghafi , ) . What does this study add ? Identified studies targeted a variety of health behaviours , with few studies in any one area . Further assessment of the effectiveness of  couple-focused versus individual interventions  for those at risk is needed . Three-arm study design s are needed to determine benefits of targeting couples versus couple-focused intervention content."
"sBackground :  Acupuncture  is a widely used treatment for   knee osteoarthritis   , but evidence of its effectiveness from r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) is contradictory . Objective : To systematic ally review RCTs to determine whether the effect of  acupuncture  is dose dependent for  symptom  management in  knee osteoarthritis .  Methods :  Seven English/Chinese data bases were search ed through January 2017 .  Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool . Slavin ’s qualitative best- evidence synthesis approach was used to provide method ological rigour . Included RCTs were separated into three categories according to the dose of  acupuncture  treatment  : high dosage ( HD ) , medium dosage ( MD ) and low dosage ( LD )  . Correlation between dose and effect of treatment was analysed . Results :  Eight RCTs with a total of 2106 subjects met the eligibility criteria  . Numbers of studies using the various doses of  acupuncture  were 1 for LD , 1 for MD and 6 for HD , respectively . Compared with LD and MD  acupuncture  treatments , strong evidence showed that there was a positive correlation between  HD acupuncture  treatment and positive outcomes . Conclusion : The effect of  acupuncture  may be associated with dose of  acupuncture  , with a higher dosage related to better treatment outcomes in terms of  relief of pain and dysfunction  in patients with knee osteoarthritis."

"5Background  Hyperglycemia in pregnancy  (  HIP  ) has been recently differentiated between  diabetes in pregnancy ( DIP ) and gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) .  The proposed protocol is relevant , and clinical concern is due to the higher risk of  adverse pregnancy outcomes  ( APO ) and long-term effects on both the mother and the fetus .  Fasting plasma glucose level  ( FPG ) and  oral glucose tolerance test  ( OGTT ) are current diagnostic tools . However , controversy persists concerning diagnostic criteria , cut-off points , and even selective or universal screening . The objective of this systematic review is to assess the  performance of metabolomic markers  in the prediction of HIP . Methods This is a protocol for a systematic review with potential meta- analysis . The primary outcome is  GDM  , defined as  glucose intolerance  identified in the  second  and third trimesters  of pregnancy  ( any FPG ≥ 92 mg/dL and < 126 mg/dL OR when 75-g OGTT shows one altered value among these : FPG ≥ 92 mg/dL or 1-h post glucose load ≥ 180 mg/dL or 2-h post glucose load ≥ 153 mg/dL ) ; the secondary outcome is  HIP  , defined as  hyperglycemia detected in the first trimester of pregnancy  ( any FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL ) . A detailed systematic literature search will be carried out in electronic data bases and conference abstract s , using the keywords “ gestational diabetes mellitus , ” “ metabolomics , ” “ pregnancy , ” and “ screening  ”  ( and their variations ) . We will include original peer- review ed articles published from Jan 1 , 1999 , to Dec 31 , 2018 . Original studies including  diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy ( T2DM and T1DM )  , multiple pregnancies , and congenital malformations will be excluded . All results regarding sample s  , participant characteristics , metabolomic techniques , and diagnostic accuracy measures  will be retrieved and analyzed . Since this is a systematic review , no ethical approval is necessary . Discussion This systematic review may have the potential to provide significant evidence -based findings on the prediction performance of metabolomics . There are short and long-term repercussions for the mother and the newborn . Therefore , both may benefit from an accurate prediction technique for HIP . Systematic review registration This protocol was registered in the PROSPERO platform under number CRD42018100175."
"yBACKGROUND & AIMS The aims of this systematic review were ( i ) to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and cachexia in  older cancer patients in a  chemotherapy  setting  , and ( ii ) to report the chemotherapy-related causes of malnutrition and ( iii ) the consequences of malnutrition on the outcomes of these patients . METHODS We search ed MEDLINE for  articles published in English or French between 2005 and 2016  and which reported retrospective or prospect i ve , observational or interventional studies of the prevalence of malnutrition and its consequences in  patients 65 years or older with solid tumors and chemotherapy-related causes of malnutrition .  RESULTS AND   Malnutrition  is prevalent up to 83 % in  older patients with cancer scheduled to receive  chemotherapy .   One third or more of  patients were malnourished before receiving  chemotherapy  .  A  weight loss  of 10 % or more during the past three or six months was reported in 8%-40 % of cancer patients , while a body mass index < 21 kg/m2 was found in 10.7%-23 % .  Malnutrition  was more prevalent in digestive ( 28%-75 % ) than in non-digestive cancers ( 8%-46.9 % ) , and also in metastatic cancers ( 64%-76.5 % ) . During the course of  chemotherapy  ,  weight loss  was observed in 40%-91.6 % of patients , depending on cancer location . The most frequently reported chemotherapy-related  digestive symptoms  likely to impair nutritional status were  dry mouth , nausea , stomach pain , diarrhea and constipation . Low Mini-Nutritional- Assessment score  was an independent predictor of early discontinuation of  chemotherapy  and increased the risk of mortality."

"eQUESTION Is  biofeedback  during the practice of lower limb activities after stroke effective in  improving performance of those activities  , and are any benefits maintained after intervention ceases ? DESIGN Systematic review with meta- analysis of r and omised trials . PARTICIPANTS  People who have had a stroke .  INTERVENTION  Biofeedback during practice of sitting , st and ing up , st and ing  , or  walking .  OUTCOME MEASURES  Continuous measures of activity congruent  with the activity trained . RESULTS  22 trials met the inclusion criteria  and  19 contained data suitable  for analysis . Effect sizes were calculated as st and ardised mean differences because different outcome measures were used . Since inclusion of all trials produced substantial statistical heterogeneity , only trials  with  a PEDro score > 4 ( 11 trials ) were included in the final analysis ( mean PEDro score 5.7 ) . In the short-term , biofeedback  improved lower limb activities  compared with usual therapy/placebo ( SMD=0.49 , 95 % CI 0.22 to 0.75 ) .  Lower limb activities  were still improved compared with usual therapy/placebo 1 to 5 months after the cessation of intervention ( SMD=0.41 , 95 % CI 0.06 to 0.75 ) .  Augmenting feedback through the use of biofeedback is superior to  usual therapy/placebo  at improving  lower limb activities  in  people  following  stroke  . Furthermore , these benefits are largely maintained in the longer term . Given that many biofeedback machines are relatively inexpensive , biofeedback could be utilised more widely in clinical practice."
"eTechnology-supported  training  is emerging as a solution to support therapists in their efforts providing high-intensity , repetitive , and task-specific treatment , in order to enhance the recovery process . The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of  different robotic devices ( end-effector and exoskeleton robots )  in comparison with any other type of intervention . Furthermore , we aim to assess whether or not better improvements are obtained in the sub-acute phase after stroke onset than in the chronic phase . A research was conducted in the electronic bibliographic data bases Cochrane , MEDLINE , and EMBASE .  A total of 17 studies were included : 14 r and omized controlled trials , 2 systematic review s , and one meta- analysis .   Fugl-Meyer and modified Ashworth scale  were selected to measure primary outcomes , i.e. ,  motor function and muscle tone . Functional independence measure and motor activity log  were selected to measure secondary outcomes , i.e. ,  activities of daily living .  In comparison with  conventional therapy  , the  robot-assisted rehabilitation  is more effective in improving  upper limb motor function recovery  , especially in  chronic stroke patients .  No significant improvements are observed in the  reduction of muscle tone or daily living activities .  The present systematic review shows that the  use of robotic devices  can positively affect the  recovery of arm function  in patients with stroke."
"  Budesonide  and  fluticasone  , delivered  alone or in combination with a LABA  , are associated with increased risk of  serious adverse pneumonia events  , but neither significantly affected  mortality  compared with controls . The safety concerns highlighted in this review should be balanced with recent cohort data and established r and omised evidence of efficacy regarding exacerbations and quality of life . Comparison of the two drugs revealed no statistically significant difference in  serious pneumonias , mortality or serious adverse events .   Fluticasone  was associated with higher risk of any  pneumonia  when compared with  budesonide  ( i.e. less serious cases dealt with in the community ) , but variation in the definitions used by the respective manufacturers is a potential confounding factor in their comparison . Primary research should accurately measure  pneumonia  outcomes and should clarify both the definition and the method of diagnosis used , especially for new formulations such as  fluticasone furoate  , for which little evidence of the associated pneumonia risk is currently available . Similarly , systematic review s and cohorts should address the reliability of assigning  ' pneumonia '  as an adverse event or cause of death and should determine how this affects the applicability of findings."
" Resistance exercise  improves  NAFLD  with less  energy consumption  . Thus ,  resistance exercise  may be more feasible than  aerobic exercise  for  NAFLD patients with poor cardiorespiratory fitness  or for those who can not tolerate or participate in  aerobic exercise .  These data may indicate a possible link between resistance exercise and lipid metabolism in the liver . LAY SUMMARY Both  aerobic and resistance exercise  reduce  hepatic steatosis  in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) with similar frequency , duration , and period of exercise ( 40 - 45min/session 3times/week for 12weeks ) ; however , the two forms of exercise have different characteristics  . Intensity and energy consumption  were significantly lower for  resistance  than for  aerobic exercise . Resistance exercise  may be more feasible than  aerobic exercise  for  NAFLD patients with poor cardiorespiratory fitness  or for those who can not tolerate or participate in aerobic exercise."
 There are insufficient data at present to guide clinical practice . A large r and omised controlled trial is needed to determine if  ad libitum of dem and /semi-dem and  feeding  of preterm infants  affects clinical ly important outcomes . This trial should focus on infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding and should be of sufficient duration to assess effects on growth and time to oral feeding and hospital discharge.
" In comparison with  placebo  , we have found an increased  risk  of  serious adverse events  with regular  formoterol  , and this does not appear to be abolished in  patients taking inhaled corticosteroids   .  The effect  on serious adverse events  of regular  formoterol  in children was greater than the effect in adults , but the difference between age groups was not significant . Data on all-cause  serious  adverse events should be more fully reported in journal articles , and not combined with all severities of adverse events or limited to those events that are thought by the investigator to be drug-related."
"mBACKGROUND Advances in  breast cancer  therapies have given rise to a growing number of patient survivors . Nevertheless , these women deal with long-term sequelae that impair their quality of life and that are lacking satisfactory assessment and expeditious management . Importantly , a new era is raising in the oncology field , namely , survivorship . METHODS A search for English- language articles on Medline was undertaken covering the last 15 years , using the terms  "" cancer survivorship ""  ,  "" quality of life ""  ,  "" fatigue ""  ,  "" insomnia ""  ,  "" sleep disturbances ""  ,  "" depression ""  ,  "" cognitive dysfunction ""  , ""  chemofog  "" , ""  peripheral neuropathy  "" , ""  fertility  "" , "" sexual  behaviour  "" , "" menopause "" , "" lymphedema "" , "" physical activity "" and ""  breast  neoplasms "" . Selection was limited to systematic review s and meta- analysis , but their reference list was examined to include papers of potential interest . RESULTS We found the most common symptoms affecting  breast cancer survivors  were  fatigue , insomnia , depression , cognitive dysfunction , reproductive and menopausal symptoms and lymphoedema .   Some of these symptoms have even been the objective of r and omised controlled trials , but consistent data are missing . The available interventions include  pharmacological , behavioural therapies and complementary and alternative medicine approaches  and will mostly depend on the type of symptom."
" There is insufficient evidence evaluating  human milk-derived fortifier with bovine milk-derived fortifier  in  exclusively breast milk-fed preterm infants .  Low-certainty evidence from one study suggests that in exclusively  breast milk-fed preterm infants   human milk-derived fortifiers  in comparison with  bovine milk-derived fortifier  may not change the  risk of necrotizing enterocolitis , mortality , feeding intolerance , infection , or improve growth .  Well- design ed r and omized controlled trials are needed to evaluate short-term and long-term outcomes."
"dAIM To classify the comparative quantity and quality of the RCT evidence of pharmacological treatment for glaucoma . METHOD A systematic review of MEDLINE , EMBASE Cochrane CENTRAL and relevant conference proceedings was conducted up to March 2007 .  RCTs recruiting adults with primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) and /or ocular hypertension ( OH ) receiving any topical  medication  or  placebo  were  included  .  RCTs containing a  prostagl and in  treatment arm were specifically considered . RESULTS  A total of 510 publications were identified .  Of these ,  181 studies had a  prostagl and  in   treatment arm  . The median  study  duration was 12 weeks ( IQR 4 - 13 ) and 78 % of included trials had a duration of 3 months or less . The four studies over 1 year in duration all included a  latanoprost and timolol  treatment arm . There was a lack of data on  younger population s ( median of the mean ages of included patients was 63.4 years [ IQR : 61 - 66 years ] ) . Caucasians  constituted 79.6 % of the studied population . Evidence by ethnicity as well as by co-morbidity , was scarce . The primary outcome for 92 % of studies was  IOP reduction ;  little was reported on other indicators . Most trials reported  adverse events  , with  hyperaemia  most commonly reported .  The RCT evidence base for glaucoma treatment is extensive . This systematic review is the first to consider the characteristics of all RCTs containing a  prostagl  and  in  arm . The majority of trials are of short duration and focus on IOP as the efficacy outcome . The limitations of this study are that only trials with a prostagl and in treatment arm are included and due to the large number of included trials only top line data were extracted."
"sUNLABELLED Although  selective  or  whole body cooling  combined with  optimal intensive care  improves outcomes following  neonatal encephalopathy in high-income countries  , the safety and efficacy of cooling in  low- and middle-income countries  is not known . OBJECTIVE We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of all published r and omised or quasi-r and omised controlled trials of  cooling therapy  for  neonatal encephalopathy in low- and middle-income countries .  RESULTS  Seven trials , comprising a total of 567 infants were included in the meta- analysis . Most study infants had mild ( 15 % ) or moderate encephalopathy ( 48 % ) and did not receive invasive ventilation ( 88 % ) .  Cooling devices included  water-circulating cooling caps , frozen gel packs , ice , water bottles , and phase-changing material .  No statistically significant reduction in  neonatal mortality  was seen with cooling ( risk ratio : 0.74 , 95 % confidence intervals : 0.44 to 1.25 ) . Data on other  neonatal morbidities and long-term neurological outcomes  were insufficient .   Cooling therapy  was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in  neonatal mortality  in  low- and middle-income countries  although the confidence intervals were wide and not incompatible with results seen in high-income countries . The apparent lack of treatment effect may be due to the heterogeneity and poor quality of the included studies , inefficiency of the low technology cooling devices , lack of optimal  neonatal intensive care  , sedation and  ventilatory support  , overuse of oxygen , or may be due to the intrinsic difference in the population , for example higher rates of  perinatal infection  ,  obstructed labor  ,  intrauterine growth retardation  and  maternal malnutrition  . Evaluation of the  safety  and  efficacy  of  cooling  in adequately powered r and omised controlled trials is required before  cooling  is offered in routine clinical practice in low- and middle-income countries."

"ePurpose The purpose of this systematic review was to describe and examine the current use of  treatment summaries and survivorship care plans ( TSs/SCPs )  for  cancer survivors  , as well as to summarize and critically assess relevant literature regarding their preferences and usefulness . There is a knowledge gap regarding the preferences of stakeholders as to what is useful on a treatment summary or  survivorship care  plan . Methods A systematic review of eligible manuscripts was conducted using preferred reporting items for systematic review s and meta-analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines . Relevant studies were identified via PubMed , CINAHL Plus ,  and the Cochrane Library from 2005 through 2013 .  Eligible studies were critically appraised with qualitative and quantitative appraisal tools . Results There were  29 studies included in this review ;  19 were quantitative . Survivors and primary care physicians preferred a printable format delivered 0 to 6 months posttreatment and highlighting  signs and symptoms of recurrence , late , and long-term effects , and recommendations for healthy living .  Oncology providers supported the concept of treatment summary and survivorship care plan but reported significant barriers to their provision . No studies incorporated  caregiver perspectives  of treatment summary and survivorship care plan . Conclusion This systematic review did not reveal conclusive evidence regarding the needs of survivors or providers regarding treatment summaries and  survivorship care  plans . A lack of rigorous studies contributed to this . Implication s for cancer survivorsTreatment summaries and  survivorship care  plans are useful for cancer survivors ; however , future rigorous studies should be conducted to identify and prioritize the preferences of survivors regarding these."
"hRecruiting  participants  is a challenge for many health , medical and psychosocial research projects . One tool more frequently being used to improve  recruitment  is the  social networking website Facebook .  A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that have used  Facebook  to recruit  participants of all ages , to any psychosocial , health or medical research . 110 unique studies that used  Facebook  as a recruitment source were included in the review .  The majority of studies used a cross-sectional design ( 80 % ) and addressed a physical health or disease issue ( 57 % ) . Half ( 49 % ) of the included studies reported specific details of the Facebook recruitment process .  Research  ers paid between $ 1.36 and $ 110 per completing participants ( Mean = $ 17.48 , SD = $ 23.06 ) . Among studies that examined the representativeness of their sample , the majority concluded ( 86 % ) their Facebook-recruited sample s were similarly representative of sample s recruited via traditional methods . These results indicate that   Facebook   is  an effective and cost-efficient recruitment method .  Research ers should consider their target group ,  advertisement wording , offering incentives  and  no-cost methods of recruitment  when considering  Facebook  as a recruitment source . It is hoped this review will assist research ers to make decisions regarding the use of  Facebook  as a recruitment tool in future research."

"sABSTRACT Several interventions have targeted  dyads  to  promote   physical activity  (  PA  )   or  reduce sedentary behaviour ( SB )  , but the evidence has not been synthesis ed .  Sixty-nine studies were identified from MEDLINE , PsycINFO , and Web of Science  , and  59 were included  in the  main  meta-analyses ( providing 72 independent tests ) . Intervention details , type of dyadic goal , participant characteristics , and method ological quality were extracted and their impact on the overall effect size was examined . Sensitivity analyses tested effect robustness to ( a ) the effects of other statistically significant moderators ; ( b ) outliers ; ( c ) data included for  participants who were  not  the main target of the  intervention . Dyadic interventions had a small  positive  ,  highly heterogeneous , effect on PA  g = .203 , 95 % CI [ 0.123–0.282 ] , compared to comparison conditions including equivalent  interventions  targeting individuals . Shared target-oriented goals ( where both dyad members hold the same PA goal for the main target of the intervention ) and peer/friend dyads were associated with larger effect sizes across most analyses . Dyadic interventions produced a  small homogeneous reduction in SB .  Given  dyadic interventions promote PA  over- and -above equivalent interventions targeting individuals , these interventions should be more widespread . However , moderating factors such as the types of PA goal and dyad need to be considered to maximise effects."
"dBackground Considerable interest exists in the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation with  the omega-3 fatty acids .  Given the interplay between pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids , and the less pro-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids , it has been thought that the latter could play a key role in treating or preventing  asthma .  The purpose was to systematic ally review the scientific-medical literature in order to identify , appraise , and synthesize the evidence for possible treatment effects of  omega-3 fatty acids  in asthma . Methods Medline , Pre medline , Embase , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , CAB Health , and , Dissertation Abstract s were search ed to April 2003 . We included  r and omized controlled trials ( RCT 's ) of subjects of any age that used any foods or  extracts containing omega-3 fatty acids  as treatment or prevention for asthma .  Data included all  asthma   related  outcomes , potential covariates , characteristics of the study , design , population , intervention/exposure , comparators , and co interventions . Results Ten RCT 's were found pertinent to the present report . Conclusion Given the largely inconsistent picture within and across respiratory outcomes , it is impossible to determine whether or not  omega-3 fatty acids  are an efficacious adjuvant or monotherapy for  children or adults  . Based on this systematic review we recommend a large r and omized controlled study of the effects of high-dose encapsulated  omega-3 fatty acids  on  ventilatory and inflammatory measures of asthma  controlling diet and other asthma risk factors . This review was limited because Meta- analysis was considered inappropriate due to missing data ; poorly or heterogeneously defined population s , interventions , intervention-comparator combinations , and outcomes . In addition , small sample sizes made it impossible to meaningfully assess the impact on clinical outcomes of co-variables . Last , few significant effects were found."

" Experimental evidence on the  benefits  and  risks  for  preterm infants of early discharge from hospital with  home gavage feeding   compared with  later discharge upon attainment of full sucking feeds  is limited to the results of one small quasi-r and omised controlled trial . High- quality trials with concealed allocation , complete follow-up of all r and omly assigned infants and adequate sample size are needed before practice recommendations can be made."
" This review demonstrates that there is no evidence from r and omised controlled trials evaluating the effect of  baby-led compared with scheduled ( or mixed ) breastfeeding  for successful breastfeeding , for  healthy newborns  , therefore no conclusions could be taken at this point . It is recommended that no changes are made to current practice guidelines without undertaking further robust research , to include many patterns of breastfeeding and not limited to baby-led and scheduled breastfeeding . Further research is needed to also evaluate the effects of  baby-led compared with scheduled ( or  mixed )  breastfeeding  on successful breastfeeding , for  healthy newborns .  However , conducting such a study , particularly a r and omised controlled trial is unlikely to receive ethical approval , as the issue of obtaining informed consent from new mothers or  mothers-to-be  for r and omisation between baby-led and scheduled breastfeeding is a difficult one and it is likely that the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative practice s would prohibit such a study."
"eBackground R and omized , controlled trials comparing long-acting  muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA )  efficacy in  COPD  are limited . This network meta- analysis ( NMA ) assessed the relative efficacy of  tiotropium 18 µg once-daily ( OD  ) and  newer agents ( aclidinium 400 µg twice-daily , glycopyrronium 50 µg OD , and umeclidinium 62.5 µg OD )  . Methods A systematic literature review identified  r and omized , controlled trials of adult COPD patients receiving  LAMAs .   A NMA within a Bayesian framework examined change from baseline in trough  forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) , transitional dyspnea index focal score , St George ’s Respiratory Question naire score , and rescue medication use  . Results  Twenty-four studies ( n=21,311 )  compared  LAMAs with placebo/each other  .  Aclidinium , glycopyrronium , tiotropium , and umeclidinium  , respectively , demonstrated favorable results  versus placebo  , for change from baseline ( 95 % credible interval )  in 12-week trough FEV1  ( primary endpoint : 101.40 mL [ 77.06–125.60 ] ; 117.20 mL [ 104.50–129.90 ] ; 114.10 mL [ 103.10–125.20 ] ; 136.70 mL [ 104.20–169.20  ] ) ; 24-week trough FEV1  ( 128.10 mL [ 84.10–172.00 ] ; 135.80 mL [ 123.10–148.30 ] ; 106.40 mL [ 95.45–117.30 ] ; 115.00 mL [ 74.51–155.30  ] ) ; 24-week St George ’s Respiratory Question naire  score ( −4.60 [ −6.76 to −2.54 ] ; −3.14 [ −3.83 to −2.45 ] ; −2.43 [ −2.92 to −1.93 ] ; −4.69 [ −7.05  to −2.31 ] ) ; 24-week transitional dyspnea index  score ( 1.00 [ 0.41–1.59 ] ; 1.01 [ 0.79–1.22 ] ; 0.82 [ 0.62–1.02 ] ; 1.00 [ 0.49–1.51 ]  ) ; and 24-week rescue medication  use ( data not available ; −0.41 puffs/day [ −0.62 to −0.20 ] ; −0.52 puffs/day [ −0.74 to −0.30 ] ; −0.30 puffs/day [ −0.81 to 0.21 ] ) . For 12-week  trough  FEV1 , differences in change from baseline ( 95 % credible interval ) were −12.8 mL ( −39.39 to 13.93 ) ,  aclidinium versus tiotropium ;  3.08 mL ( −7.58 to 13.69 ) ,  glycopyrronium versus tiotropium ;  22.58 mL ( −11.58 to 56.97 ) ,  umeclidinium versus tiotropium ;  15.90 mL ( −11.60 to 43.15 ) ,  glycopyrronium versus aclidinium ;  35.40 mL ( −5.06 to 76.07 ) ,  umeclidinium versus aclidinium ;  and 19.50 mL ( −15.30 to 54.38  )  ,  umeclidinium versus glycopyrronium .  Limitations  included inhaler-related factors and safety ;  longer-term outcomes were not considered . Conclusion The new LAMAs studied had at least comparable  efficacy   to tiotropium  , the established class st and ard . Choice should depend on physician ’s and patient ’s preference."

" There is moderate evidence that  CCT  is effective in improving  mobility  for  people after stroke  - they may be able to  walk further  , faster , with more  independence and confidence in their balance .  The effects may be greater later after the stroke , and are of clinical significance . Further high- quality research is required , investigating  quality of life , participation and cost- benefits  , that compares  CCT  with  st and ard care  and that also investigates the influence of factors such as stroke severity and age . The potential risk of increased  falls  during  CCT  needs to be monitored."
" When considering the numerous patient-related factors that come into play when  CPAP  is prescribed , the concept of  CPAP  as gold-st and ard therapy for OSA should be reconsidered .

" Despite the number of trials of  manual acupuncture  for DPN and their uniformly positive results , no clinical ly relevant conclusions can be drawn from this review due to the trials ' high risks of bias and the possibility of publication bias .

"  Laparoscopy  is a promising test , but the low number of studies and the differences between the included studies do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn from these data . Due to a difference in prevalence , there is a wide range in negative predictive values between studies . Two studies verified  all  patients . These imply a high  specificity  of   laparoscopy   in diagnosing  resectability  and have a good  sensitivity .  Both studies show that the use of criteria for unresectable disease will result in no patients inappropriately unexplored . However , there will still be patients undergoing  unsuccessful primary  laparotomy  .  Using a prediction model does not increase the  sensitivity  and will result in more unnecessarily explored patients , due to a lower specificity."
"yAbstract Purpose Nutrition is a key determinant of chronic disease in  later life .  A systematic review was conducted of studies examining  dietary  patterns   and  quality of life  ,  physical   function  , cognitive  function and mental  health  among older adults .  Methods Literature search es in MEDLINE complete , Academic Search Complete , CINAHL Complete , Ageline , Global health , PsycINFO , SCOPUS and EMBASE and h and search ing from  1980 up to December 2014 yielded 1236 results .  Inclusion criteria included  dietary pattern assessment via dietary indices or statistical approaches  ,  a sample of community-dwelling adults aged 45 years and over at baseline  and  a cross-sectional or longitudinal study design .  Exclusion criteria included a single 24-h recall of diet , evaluation of single foods or nutrients , clinical or  institutionalised sample  s and intervention studies .  Risk  of bias was assessed using the six-item Effective Public Health Practice Project ’s  Quality Assessment Tool  for Quantitative Studies . Results There were  34 articles  ( 11 cross-sectional and 23 longitudinal ) included with 23 studies examining  dietary  indices and 13 studies using empirical analysis . Most studies examined  mental health   ( n = 10 )  or  cognitive function   ( n = 18  ) , with fewer studies examining  quality of life  (  n  = 6 ) and  physical function   (  n = 8) . Although dietary pattern and outcome assessment methods varied , most studies reported positive associations between a  healthier diet  and  better health outcomes .  Conclusion Overall , the number of studies using  dietary patterns  to investigate diet and successful ageing is small , and further investigation in longitudinal studies is needed , particularly for  quality -of-life outcomes  . This review provides support for the importance of a healthy diet for the ageing population globally."
 Trial evidence that examines the effects of  n-3 PUFAs  on  depressed mood  is limited and is difficult to summarize and evaluate because of considerable heterogeneity . The evidence available provides little support for the use of  n-3 PUFAs  to improve  depressed mood .  Larger trials with adequate power to detect clinical ly important benefits are required.

"2Despite a marked increase in the prescription of  oral nutritional supplements ( ONS )  in the community ( Department of Health , 1991 - 7 ) , there is still uncertainty about the value of their use in  patients with different diseases .  To answer questions about the effects on  ONS  on  body weight and structure , spontaneous food intake and body function  , a critical systematic review was undertaken ( Stratton & Elia , 1999a ) .  Eighty-four trials were review ed ( forty-five r and omized , thirty-nine non-r and omized : 2,570 patients ; diagnoses including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , Crohn 's disease , cystic fibrosis , human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer ) .  Most studies ( 83 % ) were conducted in  patients living at home .  The supplements were typically mixed macronutrients in liquid form , providing < 0.42 - 10.5 MJ/d for 1 week-2 years . The studies review ed  in patients with predominantly chronic conditions living in the community  suggested that : ( 1 )  ONS  produce demonstrable  clinical ( including functional ) benefits  , but the nature and extent of these benefits varies with the underlying chronic condition ; ( 2 )  ONS  increase  total energy intake  with > 50 % of the energy from ONS typically additional to that from habitual food intake ; ( 3 ) improvements in  body weight , total energy intake and body function following  ONS   appear to occur more frequently in individuals with a BMI < 20 kg/m2 than in those with a BMI > 20 kg/m2."
"sObjectives Access to  biologic DMARDs  for RA is often restricted to those with severe disease . This systematic review aim ed to identify prognostic factors in  patients with moderate disease activity who may be at risk of disease progression and poor clinical outcomes .  Methods MEDLINE , Embase and Cochrane data bases were search ed ( final search 22 September 2017 ) , and  data from patients with moderate disease [ 28-joint DAS ( DAS28 ) > 3.2-≤5.1 ] were included  . Studies were evaluated according to the measure(s ) of  progression/poor outcome used : radiographic , disease activity or other indicators .  Results The search es identified  274 publications  ,  of which 30 were selected for  data extraction . Fourteen studies were prioritized , because they specifically analysed  patients with moderate RA . Nine studies   reported radiographic  progression outcomes  for 3241 patients , three studies  reported  disease  activity progression  for 1516 patients  , and  two studies reported other relevant outcomes for 2094 patients .  Prognostic factors with consistent evidence for progression/poor outcome prediction were as follows  : DAS28 ≥ 4.2 , the presence of anti-CCP antibodies , and power Doppler ultrasound score  ≥1 . Some predictors were specific  to either disease activity or radiographic progression  . Conclusion Several criteria used in st and ard clinical practice were identified that have the potential to inform the selection of  patients with moderate RA  who are at greater risk of a  poor  outcome . A combination of two or more of these factors might enhance their predictive potential . Further work is required to derive clinical decision rules incorporating these factors."
" The findings encourage the incorporation of  universal preventive interventions  into school curricula to benefit most children .

")Food insecurity ( FI ) occurs when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food . FI has been associated with negative effects on human health , including during the prenatal and neonatal periods . The objective of this study is to evaluate the consequences of FI for  pregnant women ’s and newborns ’ health .  A literature search was performed with three independent research ers based on the PRISMA guidelines ; the search  covered the period of November 2008 to July 2019  and was conducted in the following data bases : the US National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health ( PubMed ) , Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences ( LILACS ) , Cochrane Library , Web of Science , Embase , Scopus and OpenGrey . The terms and descriptors were defined by consulting the Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) and Health Sciences Descriptors ( DeCS ) platforms and mainly included “ food security ” , “ food insecurity ” , “ pregnancy ” and “ newborn ” . The studies were selected through a title and abstract review and then a reading of the full text . The quality of the studies and the risk of bias were analysed based on the criteria defined in the “ Joanna Briggs Institute Review ers ’ Manual ” and by Guyatt and colleagues for interventional studies . The population , study design ,  FI measurement instruments , FI proportions , outcomes , confounders and results  were extracted from the  37 studies  that were selected according to the eligibility and quality criteria .  FI proportions  ranged from 5.2 to 87 % . Most studies were conducted with  African population s  ( 42.2 % ) and applied globally used scales to assess FI ( 56.7 % ) ; 27 % of the studies adapted scales . There were wide variations in the instruments used to estimate FI . The main outcomes related to FI included  stress , anxiety and depression during pregnancy  , followed by  dietary quality and dietary diversity .  Associations of FI with  birth defects , neonatal mortality and the early introduction of animal milk to the infant ’s diet  were also observed . It is necessary to pay attention to the diversity of FI measurement instruments before FI results are compared . FI can be a risk factor for  depression and stress  during pregnancy , as well as for  neonatal mortality , newborn health problems and breastfeeding interruption .  This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO ( CRD42018109478 )."
"eBackground This systematic review with meta- analysis was design ed to evaluate the literature and to develop recommendations regarding the use of  preoperative radiotherapy  in the management of  patients with resectable rectal cancer .  Methods The MEDLINE , CANCERLIT and Cochrane Library data bases , and abstract s published in the annual proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology were systematic ally search ed for evidence . Relevant reports were review ed by  four members of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Disease Site Group  and the references from these reports were search ed for additional trials . External review by Ontario practitioners was obtained through a mailed survey . Final approval of the practice guideline report was obtained from the Practice Guidelines Coordinating Committee . Results Two meta-analyses of  preoperative radiotherapy versus surgery alone  , nineteen trials that compared  preoperative radiotherapy plus surgery to surgery alone  , and five trials that compared  preoperative radiotherapy to alternative treatments  were obtained . R and omized trials demonstrate that  preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgery  is significantly more effective than  surgery alone  in preventing  local recurrence  in  patients with resectable rectal cancer  and it may also improve  survival .  A single trial , using  surgery  with  total mesorectal excision  , has shown similar benefits in  local recurrence .  Conclusion For  adult patients with clinical ly resectable rectal cancer  we conclude that:•  Preoperative radiotherapy  is an acceptable alternative to the previous practice of  postoperative radiotherapy  for patients with stage II and III  resectable rectal cancer;•  Both  preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy  decrease  local recurrence  but neither improves  survival  as much as  postoperative radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy .  Therefore , if  preoperative radiotherapy  is used ,  chemotherapy  should be added postoperatively to at least patients with stage III disease."
"sOBJECTIVE To review the evidence relating to the use of  adjuvant therapy  after surgical treatment for  endometrial cancer .  OPTIONS  Women with endometrial cancer  can be given the option of receiving  adjuvant radiotherapy and /or chemotherapy  according to pathologic findings at time of surgery . OUTCOMES The outcomes measured are  postoperative progression-free and overall survival  in  endometrial cancer patients .  EVIDENCE Published literature was retrieved through search es of PubMed , CINAHL , and The Cochrane Library , using appropriate controlled vocabulary ( e.g. , endometrial neoplasms ) and key words ( e.g. , endometrium cancer , endometrial carcinoma ) . Results were restricted to systematic review s , r and omized control trials/controlled clinical trials , and observational studies . There were no date or language restrictions . Search es were up date d on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to December 31 , 2011 . Grey ( unpublished ) literature was identified through search ing the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment -related agencies , clinical practice guideline collection s , clinical trial registries , national and international medical specialty societies , and recent conference abstract s. VALUES The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care ( Table ) .  BENEFITS , HARMS , AND COSTS  This guideline is intended to help st and ardize postoperative treatment of  endometrial  cancer and minimize  undertreatment  and  overtreatment  . VALIDATION The guideline was review ed for accuracy by content experts in pathology , radiation oncology , and medical oncology . Guideline content was also compared with relevant documents from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists."

"IStudy design : A systematic review of r and omised controlled trials . Objectives : To determine the effectiveness of 22 commonly administered  physiotherapy interventions  for  people with spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ) .  Methods : The inclusion criteria contained 22 pairs of key interventions and outcomes . Each intervention and outcome was considered independently such that 22 brief review s were conducted and summarised in this one paper . The interventions included  h and , wheelchair , seated mobility , fitness , strength and gait training , as well as electrical stimulation , passive movements , stretch , cycling , exercise and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) .  Interventions were compared  with no or sham treatment , usual care or another physiotherapy intervention .  The primary outcome for each review was one of the following :  seated mobility , wheelchair mobility , h and function , gait , voluntary strength , joint mobility , fitness and pain .  Data were extracted to determine mean between-group differences or risk ratios ( 95 % confidence interval ) . Where possible , results were pooled in meta-analyses and the strength of evidence rated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation . Results :  Thirty-eight r and omised controlled trials  met the inclusion criteria and were relevant to 15 of the brief review s. The following four interventions were clearly effective :  fitness , h and and wheelchair training as well as TENS ;  however , the  strength of  evidence was not high for any of these interventions . None of the other interventions were clearly  effective  . Conclusion : There is initial evidence to support four  physiotherapy  interventions , but there is still a long way to go to put a strong evidence base to the range of  physiotherapy  interventions commonly used to manage people with SCI."
" The results of this overview seem to indicate that  TMT  is able to produce excellent  5-year OS rates  , no matter how it is done ( continuous or split ) . No significant difference in  5-year OS rates  could be observed between the two treatment regimens , although the continuous may offer some advantage compared to split treatment in terms of higher  CR  and , likely lower  SC rates .  The highest benefit might be achieved in later stage tumours , using a total radiation equivalent dose when delivered in 2Gy/fraction ( EQD2 ) of more than 60Gy in combination with CP based regimes and preceded by 2 - 3  NACT  cycles . Appropriate r and omized trials should be addressed to confirm the results of the present review."

"eBACKGROUND Lung injury is a serious complication of surgery . We did a systematic review and meta- analysis to assess whether  incidence , morbidity , and in-hospital mortality  associated with postoperative lung injury are affected by type of surgery and whether outcomes are dependent on type of ventilation . METHODS We search ed MEDLINE , CINAHL , Web of Science , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for observational studies and r and omised controlled trials published up to April , 2014 , comparing  lung-protective mechanical ventilation with conventional mechanical ventilation  during  abdominal or thoracic surgery in adults .  Individual patients ' data were assessed .  Attributable mortality  was calculated by subtracting the in-hospital mortality of  patients without postoperative lung injury  from that of patients with  postoperative lung injury .  FINDINGS We identified  12 investigations involving 3365 patients .  The  total incidence of postoperative lung injury  was similar for abdominal and thoracic surgery ( 3·4 % vs 4·3 % , p=0·198 ) .  Patients who developed postoperative lung injury were older  , had  higher American Society of Anesthesiology scores and  prevalence of sepsis or  pneumonia  , more frequently had received blood transfusions during surgery , and received ventilation with higher tidal volumes , lower positive end-expiratory pressure levels , or both , than  patients who did  not .  Patients with postoperative lung injury  spent longer in intensive care ( 8·0 [ SD 12·4 ] vs 1·1 [ 3·7 ] days , p<0·0001 ) and hospital ( 20·9 [ 18·1 ] vs 14·7 [ 14·3 ] days , p<0·0001 ) and had  higher in-hospital mortality  ( 20·3 % vs 1·4 % p<0·0001 ) than those without injury  . Overall attributable mortality  for postoperative lung injury was 19 % ( 95 % CI 18 - 19 ) , and differed significantly between abdominal and thoracic surgery patients ( 12·2 % , 95 % CI 12·0 - 12·6 vs 26·5 % , 26·2 - 27·0 ,  p=0·0008 ) . The risk of in-hospital mortality  was independent of ventilation strategy ( adjusted HR 0·71 , 95 % CI 0·41 - 1·22 ) . INTERPRETATION Postoperative lung injury is associated with  increases in in-hospital mortality  and  duration s of  stay in intensive care and  hospital  . Attributable mortality due to postoperative lung injury is higher after thoracic surgery than after abdominal surgery .

" This network meta- analysis compares four different classes of long-acting inhalers for  people with COPD who need more than short-acting bronchodilators .   Quality of life and lung function  were improved most on combination inhalers ( LABA and ICS ) and least on ICS alone at 6 and at 12 months . Overall  LAMA  and  LABA  inhalers had similar effects , particularly at 12 months . The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for these outcomes in  participants who largely had an  FEV1  that was less than 50 % predicted  , but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential for increased  adverse events  ( which has been established by other review s ) require consideration . Our findings are in keeping with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) guidelines."
" : Compared with surgery alone , surgery combined  with IHIC  can  improve survival rate  and  reduce the recurrence rate  , with acceptable safety .

"hINTRODUCTION  Meniscectomy  , a most common orthopaedic procedure , results in increased contact area of the articular surfaces of tibia and femur leading to early osteoarthritis . We systematic ally review the literature on clinical outcomes following   partial meniscal replacement  using different scaffolds .  SOURCES OF DATA We performed a comprehensive search of Medline , CINAHL , Embase and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials . The reference lists of the selected articles were then examined by h and . Only studies focusing on investigation of  clinical outcomes on patients undergoing a  partial meniscal replacement  using  a scaffold   were selected . We then evaluated the method ological quality of each article using the  Coleman methodology score (  CMS ) , a 10 criteria scoring list assessing the method ological quality of the selected studies ( CMS ) . AREAS OF AGREEMENT  Fifteen studies  were included , all prospect i ve studies , but only 2 were r and omized controlled trials .  Biological scaffolds  were involved in 12 studies , 2 studies investigated  synthetic scaffolds  , whereas 1 remaining article presented data from the use of both classes of device . The mean modified CMS was 64.6 . AREAS OF CONTROVERSY Several demographic and biomechanical factors could influence the outcomes of this treatment modality . GROWING POINTS Partial replacement using both classes  of scaffolds  achieves significant and encouraging improved clinical  results  when compared with baseline values or with controls when present , without no adverse reaction related to the device . RESEARCH There is a need for more and better design ed r and omized trials , to confirm with a stronger level of evidence the promising preliminary results achieved by the current research."

"dBACKGROUND & AIMS  Preterm infants  are a heterogeneous group and many accumulate growth  deficits  before and after  initial hospital discharge  . Although this is associated with worse  cognitive outcome  , recent meta-analyses suggest that  nutrient fortification of breast milk  , or the  use of nutrient and energy rich formulae  after discharge exert little effect on growth and neurodevelopment  .  However , the complexity of study design , inclusion criteria and outcome parameters , combined with differences in formula composition mean that meta- analysis may overlook important effects of differing interventions in sub-groups . METHODS We systematic ally identified evidence and mapped the information on Participants , Intervention , Comparator , and Outcome ( PICO ) from  31 published studies  illustrating the marked heterogeneity in study design and interventions next to outcomes on  ( quality of ) growth and neurodevelopment .  RESULTS Despite significant heterogeneity in study design , we found that  nutrient enriched diets  after discharge show no negative effects but frequently improve  growth parameters  at some point in the course of the study , in particular for boys  .  The data indicates that when energy requirements are adequate ,  increased protein  results in  increased growth and lean mass ( LM ) accretion ;  In particular ,  higher protein to energy ratios  lead to  increased lean mass accretion  , and  increased head circumference ( HC )  at one year . However , improvements in  neurodevelopmental outcome  were rarely seen .  This comprehensive evidence mapping approach to the field provides a broad but detailed overview of the currently available evidence . Furthermore , we identified key gaps in existing knowledge on the role of nutrient enrichment in the post-discharge period."
" In  preterm and low birth weight infants  , feeding with  formula  milk compared with donor breast milk results in a higher  rate of short-term growth  but also a higher  risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis .  There are only limited data on the comparison of feeding with formula milk versus  nutrient-fortified donor breast milk .  This limits the applicability of the findings as nutrient fortification of breast milk is now a common practice in neonatal care . Future trials may compare  growth , development and adverse outcomes  in  infants  who  receive formula milk versus nutrient-fortified  donor breast milk   given as a supplement to maternal expressed breast milk or as a sole diet."
"sCancer is currently a leading cause of deaths worldwide and the number of new cases is growing rapidly in both , developed and developing countries .  Nutritional management  during and after cancer treatment affects treatment  efficacy  and patient  quality of life ( QOL ) .  This review systemically examined the effect of  oral nutritional interventions  on nutritional and clinical outcomes in  cancer patients .  We especially focused on outcomes such as  nutritional status indices , immune-associated biochemical markers  , and  QOL assessment s  to provide insights on the applicability of different outcomes . A total of  28 papers were selected  for systematic review . The nutritional composition of  oral nutritional supplements ( ONS )  , outcome measures , and efficacy of the  oral nutritional interventions  were summarized and discussed . Most ONS contain 1 or more functional components in addition to basic nutrients . Each study used various outcome measures and significant efficacy was observed for a limited number of measures .  Nutritional status indices , QOL measures , and the duration of hospital stay  improved in about 40 % of the studies . One or more markers  of immune function and inflammatory responses  were improved by ONS in 65 % of the selected studies . These results suggest that appropriate use of ONS may be an ideal way to improve  treatment efficacy ;  however , additional intervention trials are required to confirm these findings."

" Our review findings have not identified conclusive evidence of benefit of  HCW vaccination programmes  on specific outcomes of  laboratory-proven influenza , its complications ( lower respiratory tract infection , hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract illness )  , or all  cause mortality  in  people over the age of 60 who live in care institutions .  This review did not find information on co- interventions with healthcare worker vaccination :  h and -washing , face masks  , early detection of  laboratory-proven influenza  ,  quarantine  ,  avoiding admissions  ,  antivirals  and asking healthcare workers with influenza or influenza-like illness ( ILI ) not to work . This review does not provide reasonable evidence to support the vaccination of  healthcare workers  to prevent influenza in  those aged 60 years or older resident in LTCIs .  High quality RCTs are required to avoid the risks of bias in methodology and conduct identified by this review and to test further these interventions in combination."
"tThe  tumor necrosis factor inhibitors infliximab and adalimumab  are effective treatments for Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ; however , some patients treated with  infliximab  experience a loss of  efficacy .  There is a lack of high- quality evidence available on whether  adalimumab  is an effective treatment for  patients who have failed  infliximab  treatment .  A systematic review was carried out to examine the efficacy and safety of  adalimumab  for the treatment of  CD in patients who have failed  infliximab  treatment .  PubMed , Google Scholar , and the Cochrane Library were search ed using the terms '  adalimumab AND infliximab  AND Crohn 's ' . R and omized-controlled trials and cohort studies were included if they involved patients treated with  adalimumab  after failing  infliximab .  Outcomes were  response and remission rates , adverse event ( AE ) rate , and the rate of discontinuations because of AEs .   Ten studies  ( one r and omized-controlled trial and nine cohort studies  ) involving 1009 patients were included .  Luminal  disease remission rates  ranged from 12 to 67 % during induction and 29 to 72 % during maintenance therapy .  Fistulizing disease remission rates  ranged from 5 to 50 % during induction and 27 to 68 % during maintenance therapy .  Luminal disease response rates  ranged from 29 to 83 % during induction and 31 to 59 % during maintenance therapy .  Fistulizing disease response rates  ranged from 15 to 44 % during induction and 41 to 56 % during maintenance therapy . The  overall AE rate  ranged from 13 to 69 % . Most  AEs  were mild to moderate in severity  .  The  rate of discontinuation because of AEs  ranged from 0 to 14 % . The findings reported in the current literature support  adalimumab  as an  efficacious and safe  treatment for CD in patients who have failed infliximab treatment."

"RAims The success of  anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR )  depends on osseointegration at the graft‐tunnel interface and intra‐articular ligamentization . Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of clinical and pre clinical studies that evaluated biological augmentation of graft healing in ACLR . Material s and Methods In all ,  1879 studies were identified across three data bases .  Following assessment against strict criteria ,  112 studies were included ( 20 clinical studies ; 92 animal studies ) .  Results Seven categories of biological interventions were identified :  growth factors , bio material s , stem cells , gene therapy , autologous tissue , biophysical/environmental , and pharmaceuticals .  The  method ological quality of animal studies  was moderate in 97 % , but only 10 % used clinical ly relevant outcome measures . The most interventions in clinical trials target the graft‐tunnel interface and are applied intraoperatively .   Platelet‐rich  plasma  is the most studied intervention , but  the clinical outcomes  are mixed , and the  method ological  quality of studies was suboptimal . Other biological therapies investigated in clinical trials include :   remnant‐augmented ACLR ; bone substitutes ; calcium phosphate‐hybridized grafts ; extracorporeal shockwave therapy ;  and  adult autologus non‐cultivated stem cells  .  Conclusion There is extensive pre clinical research supporting the use of biological  therapies  to augment ACLR . Further clinical studies that meet the minimum st and ards of reporting are required to determine whether emerging biological strategies will provide tangible benefits in  patients undergoing  ACLR."

"eThe aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of  chemotherapy and support treatment  in  patients with advanced non-resectable gastric cancer  in a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized clinical trials that included a comparison of  chemotherapy and support care treatment  in  patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma , regardless of their age , gender or place of treatment .  The search strategy was based on the criteria of the Cochrane Base , using the following key words : 1 ) r and omized clinical trials and antineoplastic combined therapy or gastrointestinal neoplasm , 2 ) stomach neoplasm and drug therapy , 3 ) clinical trial and multi-modality therapy , 4 ) stomach neoplasm and drug therapy or quality of life , 5 ) double-blind method or clinical trial . The search was carried out using the Cochrane , Medline and Lilacs data bases .  Five studies  fulfilled the inclusion  criteria , for a total of 390 participants , 208 ( 53 % ) receiving  chemotherapy  , 182 ( 47 % ) receiving  support care treatment  and 6 losses ( 1.6 % ) .  The  1-year survival rate  was 8 % for support care and 20 % for  chemotherapy  ( RR = 2.14 , 95 % CI = 1.00 - 4.57 , P = 0.05 ) ; 30 % of the patients in the chemotherapy group and 12 % in the support care group attained a  6-month symptom-free period  ( RR = 2.33 , 95 % CI = 1.41 - 3.87 , P < 0.01 ) .  Quality of life  evaluated after 4 months was significantly better for the  chemotherapy  patients ( 34 % ; RR = 2.07 , 95 % CI = 1.31 - 3.28 , P < 0.01 ) with  tumor mass reduction  ( RR = 3.32 , 95 % CI = 0.77 - 14.24 , P = 0.1 ) .  Chemotherapy  increased the  1-year survival rate  of the patients and provided a longer  symptom-free period  of 6 months and an improvement in quality of life."
"sBACKGROUND There is ongoing controversy regarding the validity of controlled diagnostic blocks due to variability in sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy . Consequently , identification of false-positive rates , false-negative rates , and placebo responses is crucial . The reasons described for false-positive responses to  diagnostic anesthetic blocks  are many ; however , sedation and psychological factors have been implied as causes . Further , there is no consensus with regards to sedation prior to controlled diagnostic blocks and their influence on the accuracy and validity of a diagnosis . STUDY DESIGN A systematic review of the literature evaluating the influence of  sedation  on diagnostic spinal interventional techniques . OBJECTIVES To systematic ally assess the quality of clinical studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of controlled diagnostic blocks in the diagnosis of  chronic spinal pain .  METHODS A comprehensive evaluation of the literature relating to  sedation  in diagnostic interventional techniques was performed . The method ologic quality assessment of the studies was carried out by utilizing Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ ) method ologic quality criteria with scores of 50 or higher included in the assessment of the level of evidence . Level of evidence was based on the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) criteria for the assessment of accuracy of diagnostic studies . LIMITATIONS All 3 of the studies were produced by one group of authors . Thus paucity of the literature on the subject of facet joint pain and the lack of literature on the subjects of discogenic pain and sacroiliac joint pain are major limitations . RESULTS Three studies were identified which met inclusion and method ologic assessment quality criteria .  Sedation  can be a confounding factor in a small population of patients specifically if  fentanyl  is employed and non-stringent criteria are followed . Based on the 3 r and omized double-blind trials with stringent criteria utilizing 80 % pain relief and the ability to perform prior painful movements without any significant pain following the diagnostic injection in evaluation of facet joint pain , the indicated evidence is Level II-1 .  This systematic review provides no significant evidence of the influence of  sedation  either with  midazolam  or  fentanyl  in the evaluation of cervical and lumbar facet joint pain with controlled cervical and lumbar facet joint nerve blocks with an indicated evidence of Level II-1 , with application of stringent criteria of at least 80 % pain relief and the ability to perform previously painful movements after the diagnostic blocks."
" Low to moderate quality evidence indicates that  self-management education programmes  result in no or small benefits in  people with osteoarthritis  but are unlikely to cause harm . Compared with  attention  control , these programmes probably do not improve  self-management skills , pain , osteoarthritis symptoms , function or quality of life  , and have unknown effects on  positive and active engagement in life .  Compared with usual care , they may slightly improve  self-management skills , pain , function and symptoms  , although these benefits are of unlikely clinical importance .Further studies investigating the effects of  self-management  education  programmes  , as delivered in the trials in this review , are unlikely to change our conclusions substantially , as confounding from biases across studies would have likely favoured self-management . However , trials assessing other models of  self-management education  programme delivery may be warranted . These should adequately describe the intervention they deliver and consider the exp and ed PROGRESS-Plus framework and health literacy , to explore issues of health equity for recipients."
" We identified four studies comparing regular formoterol to regular  salmeterol  ( without r and omised inhaled corticosteroids , but all participants were on regular  background inhaled corticosteroids )  . The events were infrequent and consequently too few patients have been studied to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn about the relative safety of formoterol and salmeterol .  Asthma-related serious adverse events  were rare and there were no reported asthma-related deaths."
"eCochrane systematic review s and meta-analyses on  education and monitoring of   asthmatic  children   have come to divergent conclusions , mainly because of the heterogeneity of education programmes and patients . There is little doubt that education is useful . However , the useful components of the education programmes remain to be eluci date d , not only by r and omized controlled trials but also by observational studies performed within distinct asthma phenotypes . Any  education and monitoring  package needs to contain basic explanation about the disease and its influencing factors , as well as inhalation instructions . There is no good evidence to justify home  monitoring of lung function ;  symptom monitoring suffices . Probably , the crucial part of asthma education programmes is a high level of agreement between patient and doctor regarding the goals of the  treatment  ( patient-doctor partnership ) . Therefore , further exploration of the patient 's needs should be worthwhile."

"  Depressive symptoms  were the most prevalent in  informal caregivers of survivors of intensive care who were ventilated for more than  48  hours  and persist at 1 year with a prevalence of 22.8 - 29.0 % , which is comparable with caregivers of  patients with dementia .  Screening for caregiver risks could be performed during the ICU admission where intervention can be implemented and then evaluated . Further high- quality studies are needed to  quantify anxiety , stress , caregiver burden , and posttraumatic stress disorder  outcomes in informal caregivers of long-stay patients surviving ICU."
" Very low- quality evidence from this review suggests that  CPAP  initiated during the postoperative period might  reduce postoperative atelectasis , pneumonia and reintubation  , but its effects on  mortality , hypoxia or invasive ventilation  are uncertain . Evidence is not sufficiently strong to confirm the benefits or harms of  CPAP  during the postoperative period in those  undergoing major abdominal surgery  . Most of the included studies did not report on adverse effects attributed to  CPAP.New  , high- quality research is much needed to evaluate the use of  CPAP  in preventing mortality and morbidity following major abdominal surgery . With increasing availability of  CPAP  to  our surgical patients  and its potential to improve outcomes ( possibly in conjunction with intraoperative lung protective ventilation strategies ) , unanswered questions regarding its efficacy and safety need to be addressed . Any future study must report on the adverse effects of CPAP."
"hAIMS The aim of the study was to assess the cumulative evidence on the effectiveness of   brief alcohol interventions  in primary healthcare  in order to highlight key knowledge gaps for further research . METHODS An overview of systematic review s and meta-analyses of the  effectiveness  of  brief alcohol  intervention  in primary healthcare  published between  2002 and 2012 .  FINDINGS  Twenty-four systematic review s met the eligibility criteria ( covering a total of 56 r and omized controlled trials reported across 80 papers )  . Across the included studies , it was consistently reported that brief intervention was effective for addressing hazardous and harmful drinking in primary healthcare , particularly in middle-aged , male drinkers . Evidence gaps included : brief  intervention effectiveness  in key groups ( women , older and younger drinkers , minority ethnic groups , dependent/co-morbid drinkers and those living in transitional and developing countries ) ; and the optimum brief intervention length and frequency to maintain  longer-term effectiveness  .  This overview highlights the large volume of primarily positive evidence supporting  brief alcohol intervention  effects as well as some unanswered questions with regards to the effectiveness of  brief alcohol intervention  across different cultural setting s and in specific population groups , and in respect of the optimum content of brief interventions that might benefit from further research."

" Findings from this review suggest that  LNS supplementation  has a slight , positive effect on  weight at birth , length at birth , SGA and newborn stunting  compared to  IFA . LNS and MMN  were comparable for  all maternal , birth and infant outcomes .  Both  IFA  and  MMN  were better at reducing  maternal anaemia  when compared to  LNS .  We did not find any trials for  LNS  given to  pregnant women in emergency setting  s . Readers should interpret the beneficial findings of the review with caution since the evidence comes from a small number of trials , with one-large scale study ( conducted in community setting s in Bangladesh ) driving most of the impact . In addition , effect sizes are too small to propose any concrete recommendation for practice."

" Evidence from  11 RCTs  assessing different methods or setting s for glucose monitoring for GDM suggests no clear differences for the primary outcomes or other secondary outcomes assessed in this review .However , current evidence is limited by the small number of RCTs for the comparisons assessed , small sample sizes , and the variable method ological quality of the RCTs . More evidence is needed to assess the effects of different methods and setting s for glucose monitoring for GDM on outcomes for mothers  and  their children , including  use and costs of health care .  Future RCTs may consider collecting and reporting on the st and ard outcomes suggested in this review."
"  Lifestyle interventions  are the primary therapeutic strategy for  women with GDM .  Women receiving  lifestyle interventions  were less likely to have  postnatal depression  and were more likely to achieve postpartum weight goals . Exposure to lifestyle interventions was associated with a decreased  risk of the baby being born LGA and decreased neonatal adiposity . Long-term maternal and childhood/adulthood outcomes  were poorly reported . The value of  lifestyle interventions  in low- and middle-income countries or for different ethnicities remains unclear . The longer-term  benefits or  harms of lifestyle  interventions  remains unclear due to limited reporting . The contribution of individual components of lifestyle  interventions  could not be assessed .  Ten per cent of participants  also received some form of  pharmacological therapy . Lifestyle interventions  are useful as the primary therapeutic strategy and most commonly include   healthy eating , physical activity  and  self-monitoring  of  blood glucose  concentrations .  Future research could focus on which specific interventions are most useful ( as the sole intervention without pharmacological treatment ) , which health professionals should give them and the optimal format for providing the information . Evaluation of  long-term  outcomes for the  mother and her  child should be a priority when planning future trials . There has been no in-depth exploration of the  costs ' saved  ' from reduction in risk of LGA/macrosomia and potential longer-term risks for the infants."
" Neither long-acting beta-2 agonists nor long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist bronchodilators demonstrate improvement in our  primary outcome of FEV1  . No difference was observed between intervention and placebo in  terms of quality of life or adverse events  . The quality of evidence for the use of beta-2 agonists was very low . The use of a long-acting inhaled bronchodilator may help to reduce the burden of treatment for  people with cystic fibrosis  as it is taken less often than a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator , but future trials would benefit from looking at the effects on our primary outcomes  ( spirometric changes from baseline , quality of life and adverse effects )  in the longer term."

"]ISSUES Mobile phone use has increased dramatically and concurrent with rapid developments in mobile phone-based health interventions . The integration of  text messaging interventions  promises to optimise the delivery of care for  persons with substance dependence with minimal disruption to clinical workflows .  We conducted a systematic review to assess the  acceptability , feasibility and clinical impact  of  text messaging interventions  for  persons with illicit drug and alcohol dependence .  APPROACH Studies were required to evaluate the use of  text messaging  as an intervention for  persons who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th edition criterion for a diagnosis of illicit drug and /or alcohol dependence .  Authors search ed for articles published to date in MEDLINE ( pubmed .gov ) , the Cochrane Library , EMBASE , CINAHL , Google Scholar and PsychINFO . KEY FINDINGS Eleven articles met the search criteria for this review and support the  acceptability and feasibility  of   text  messaging interventions  for addressing illicit drug and alcohol dependence . Most studies demonstrated  improved clinical outcomes , medication adherence and engagement  with peer  support  groups .  Text messaging interventions  also intervened on multiple therapeutic targets such as  appointment attendance , motivation , self-efficacy , relapse prevention and social support .  IMPLICATION S Suggestions for future research are described , including intervention design features , clinician contact , privacy measures and integration of behaviour change theories .

"sThe aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of treatment duration on   children  ’s  behavior  and  /or anxiety  in the dental setting  . To this end , a systematic search was conducted in Pubmed / Medline and Scopus from 1970 to march 2017 for English language articles that assessed the relationship between   dental treatment duration or length  , and  fear/anxiety  or  behavior  in children aged < 12 with no confounding medical and /or psychological history and neuro-psychiatric disabilities .  Four studies investigating the effect of treatment duration on children ’s  behavior  during and /or after treatment were included . None of the review ed studies investigated the effect of  treatment duration  on   children ’s  dental anxiety or fear .  There was a general tendency towards  deterioration of children ’s behavior  with an increase in treatment duration . In conclusion , our results undermine the validity of current suggestions about the  appropriate treatment duration .  Further clinical trials are needed to establish appropriate treatment duration for more  effective behavioral management  of pediatric patients during dental proce-dures."
" We could not conclude that the  immune responses  elicited by the combined vaccine were different from , or equivalent to , the separate vaccines . Data for the primary outcome ( prevention of disease ) were lacking . There was significantly less  immunological response  for HIB and HBV , and more  local reactions  in the combined injections . However , these differences rely mostly on one study each . Studies did not use an intention-to-treat analysis and we were uncertain about the risk of bias in many of the studies . These results are therefore inconclusive . Studies addressing clinical end-points whenever possible , using correct methodology and a large enough sample size should be conducted."

"yGastric  cancer with metastases outside of the regional lymph nodes  is deemed oncologically unresectable . Nevertheless , some metastatic lesions are technically resectable by applying established surgical techniques such as  para-aortic lymphadenectomy  and  hepatectomy .  At the time of compilation of the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines version 4 , systematic review s were conducted to see whether it is feasible to make any recommendation to dissect both the primary and metastatic lesions with intent to cure , possibly as part of multimodality treatment . Long-term  survivors  were found among carefully selected groups of patients both in prospect i ve and retrospective studies . In addition , there is a growing list of publications reporting encouraging outcomes of gastrectomy conducted after exceptionally good response to  chemotherapy  , usually among  patients who underwent R0 resection .  This type of surgery is often referred to as  conversion surgery .  It is sometimes difficult to define a clear borderline between  curative  surgery   scheduled after  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  and the  conversion surgery  . This review summarizes what we knew after the literature review s conducted at the time of compiling the Japanese guidelines and in addition reflects some new findings obtained thereafter through clinical trials and retrospective studies . Metastases were divided into three categories based on the major metastatic pathways : lymphatic , hematogenous , and peritoneal . In each of these categories , there were findings that could provide hope for  patients with metastatic disease .  These findings implied that the surgical technique that we already use could become more useful upon further developments in  antineoplastic  agents and drug delivery."

"yA meta- analysis of all relevant r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) was performed to assess the role of  maintenance therapy with either a continuation or a switch strategy  in the treatment of  non-small-cell lung cancer  and to investigate improvement in  overall survival ( OS ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) .  Depending on the  tumor histologic type ( squamous or nonsquamous )  ,  OS  and  PFS  were also investigated . We used electronic data bases to search for publications reporting RCTs comparing  maintenance therapy and placebo  or  observation   from January 1990 to March 2012  . The primary endpoint of  OS  and the secondary endpoint of  PFS  were analyzed .  Hazard ratios ( HRs )  with their 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were derived .  Eleven trials of 4790 patients were eligible for this analysis  . A trend of  improved OS  was found in  continuation maintenance therapy  , despite a lack of statistical significance ( HR 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.66 - 1.01 ; P = .06 ) .  Improved OS  with statistical significance was seen in switch maintenance therapy ( HR , 0.80 ; 95 % CI , 0.72 - 0.90 ; P = .0002 ) .  PFS benefit  was found with both continuation ( HR , 0.54 ; 95 % CI , 0.46 - 0.63 ; P < .00001 ) and switch maintenance therapy ( HR , 0.64 ; 95 % CI , 0.59 - 0.70 ; P < .00001 ) . The squamous subgroup analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences in  either OS  ( HR , 0.91 ; 95 % CI , 0.63 - 1.30 ; P = .60 )  or PFS  ( HR , 0.80 ; 95 % CI , 0.58 - 1.10 ; P = .17 ) , whereas the nonsquamous subgroup analysis revealed an improvement in  both OS  ( HR , 0.78 ; 95 % CI , 0.64 - 0.94 ; P = .009 )  and PFS  ( HR , 0.56 ; 95 % CI , 0.50 - 0.63 ; P < .00001 ) . Maintenance therapy was associated with  higher drug-related grade 3 or greater toxic effects  but without  harming the patients ' quality of life .  Maintenance therapy with either a continuation or a switch  strategy significantly increased PFS but OS  was significantly improved only with the switch strategy .  Patients with a nonsquamous histologic subgroup  seemed to be more suitable for maintenance therapy."
"pSummary We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of  networked ICT interventions  in supporting  carers of people with dementia .  Five bibliographic data bases were search ed and a total of  1456 abstract  s were identified as potentially relevant . From these we identified 15 papers describing five interventions :  ComputerLink  , AlzOnline , Caring for Others and two studies from the REACH project ( TLC and CTIS ) . The interventions review ed were multifaceted with elements of  networked peer support .  Outcomes were inconsistent but suggested that the interventions had moderate  effects  on  improving carer stress and depression .  Treatment effects were found to vary with caregiver characteristics such as ethnic groups , formal support and baseline burden . Further evaluation is needed in robust trials with good follow-up."
"yObjective The role of  neoadjuvant therapy ( NAT )  in  resectable pancreatic cancer ( RPC )  remains controversial . Therefore , this meta- analysis was performed to compare the clinical differences between  NAT  and  upfront surgery  in RPC . Material s and methods A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed , Embase , Web of Science , and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials data bases .  Only patients with RPC who underwent  tumor resection  and received  adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment  were enrolled .  The  OR or HR  and 95  % CIs  were calculated employing fixed-effects or r and om-effects models . The HR and its 95 % CI were extracted from each article that provided survival curve . Publication bias was estimated using funnel plots and Egger 's regression test . Results In total ,  eleven studies were included with 9,386 patients .  Of these patients , 2,508 ( 26.7 % ) received  NAT .  For patients  with  RPC ,  NAT  result ed in an increased  R0 resection rate  ( OR=1.89 ; 95 % CI=1.26 - 2.83 ) and a reduced  positive lymph node rate  ( OR=0.34 ; 95 % CI=0.31 - 0.37 ) compared with upfront surgery . Nevertheless , patients receiving  NAT  did not exhibit a significantly increased  overall survival ( OS ) time  ( HR=0.91 ; 95 % CI=0.79 - 1.05 ) . Conclusion In  patients with RPC  ,  R0 resection rate and positive lymph node rate  after  NAT  were superior to those of patients with upfront surgery . The  NAT  group exhibited no significant effect on  OS time  when compared with the upfront surgery group . However , this conclusion requires more clinical evidence to improve its credibility."
"sAims : The aim of this study was to synthesis e and evaluate the effectiveness of  mobile phone-based self-management interventions  for medication adherence and change in blood pressure in  patients with coronary heart disease .  Methods : Relevant r and omised controlled trials evaluating  mobile phone-based self-management interventions  for medication adherence and /or change in blood pressure in  coronary heart disease patients  were identified by search ing  six electronic data  bases ( PubMed , Cochrane , CINAHL , ProQuest , Scopus and EMBASE ) from January  2008 to  January  2019  . The trials were screened , data were extracted and quality was assessed by two independent review ers . Meta-analyses were performed for different outcomes while narrative syntheses were conducted for studies that could not be pooled or when there was the presence of high heterogeneity . Results :  Fifteen trials were included in this  review , of which 11 of these trials were meta-analysed .  Mobile phone-based self-management interventions  were associated with a statistically significant reduction  in diastolic blood pressure  ( combined mean difference of −1.99 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) –3.20 to −0.78 ; P=0.0001 ) ) . However , the combined effect on  medication  adherence ( medium size effect of d=0.72 ( 95 % CI −0.32 to 1.75 ; P=0.17 ) ) and  change in systolic blood pressure  ( combined mean difference of −1.08 ( 95 % CI −5.51 to 3.35 ; P=0.63 ) ) was not statistically significant . There was significant heterogeneity among the trials review ed .  Conclusion  :  Mobile phone-based self-management interventions  have the potential to improve self-management and adherence in  patients with coronary heart disease  but better design ed , conducted and reported trials are needed to demonstrate this."

"aBACKGROUND The extent of cross-protection is a key element in the choice of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine to use in vaccination programmes . We compared the cross-protective efficacy of the  bivalent vaccine ( HPV 16 and 18 ;  Cervarix , GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium ) and  quadrivalent vaccine ( HPV 6 , 11 , 16 , and 18 ;  Gardasil , Merck , Whitehouse Station , NJ , USA ) against non-vaccine  type HPVs  . METHODS We search ed Medline and Embase data bases , conference abstract s , and manufacturers ' websites for r and omised clinical trials assessing the efficacy of  bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines  against  persistent infections (  lasting  ≥6 months ) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN )  associated with the  non-vaccine type HPVs ( types 31 , 33 , 45 , 52 , and 58 ) . We included studies of participants who were HPV DNA negative before vaccination for all HPV types assessed .  We assessed heterogeneity  in vaccine efficacy  estimates between trials with I(2 ) and χ(2 ) statistics . FINDINGS We identified two clinical trials ( Females United to Unilaterally Reduce Endo/Ectocervical Disease [ FUTURE ] I and II ) of the quadrivalent vaccine and three ( Papilloma Trial Against Cancer In Young Adults [ PATRICIA ] , HPV007 , and HPV-023 ) of the bivalent vaccine . Analysis of the most comparable population s ( pooled FUTURE I/II data vs PATRICIA ) suggested  that cross-protective vaccine efficacy estimates  against infections and lesions associated with HPV 31 , 33 , and 45 were usually higher for the bivalent vaccine than the quadrivalent  vaccine . Vaccine efficacy  in the bivalent trial was higher than it was in the quadrivalent trial against persistent infections with HPV 31 ( 77·1 % [ 95 % CI 67·2 to 84·4 ] for bivalent vaccine vs 46·2 % [ 15·3 to 66·4 ] for quadrivalent vaccine ; p=0·003 ) and HPV 45 ( 79·0 % [ 61·3 to 89·4 ] vs 7·8 % [ -67·0 to 49·3 ] ; p=0·0003  )  , and against  CIN grade 2 or  worse associated with HPV 33 ( 82·3 % [ 53·4 to 94·7 ] vs 24·0 % [ -71·2 to 67·2 ] ; p=0·02 ) and HPV 45 ( 100 % [ 41·7 to 100 ] vs -51·9 % [ -1717·8 to 82·6 ] ; p=0·04 ) . We noted substantial  heterogeneity between vaccine efficacy  in bivalent trials against persistent infections with HPV 31 ( I(2)=69 % , p=0·04 ) and HPV 45 ( I(2)=70 % , p=0·04 ) , with apparent reductions in cross-protective efficacy with increased follow-up . INTERPRETATION The bivalent vaccine seems more efficacious against non-vaccine HPV types 31 , 33 , and 45 than the quadrivalent vaccine , but the differences were not all significant and might be attributable to differences in trial design  . Efficacy  against persistent infections with types 31 and 45 seemed to decrease in bivalent trials with increased follow-up , suggesting a waning of cross-protection ; more data are needed to establish duration of cross-protection .

"lBACKGROUND Biomarkers are detected during bone formation and resorption associated with the dynamics of bone metabolism and are gaining importance as preferential indicators of bone healing in comparison with conventional method ologies . Current literature suggests that the usage of  bone turnover markers  for monitoring bone regeneration in association with bio material s is limited . AIM To systematic ally review literature and evaluate whether  bone-biomarkers  can independently predict bone regeneration following implantation of various bone bio material s. MATERIAL S AND METHODS An electronic search was conducted in PubMed  ( MEDLINE ) data base from 1980 to January 2017  . The articles for systematic review were selected based on formulated inclusion and exclusion criteria Results : Upon data base search ing ,  443 articles were retrieved and thoroughly review ed  based on the  inclusion and exclusion  criteria . In all ,  41 studies were finally included for evaluation  out of which 4 were  clinical studies  and the remaining 37  studies utilized animal models .  On further evaluation , 12 studies reported the presence of  biomarkers  in association with cellular response during bone regeneration around bio- material s. Moreover , biomarkers related  to enzyme activity and matrix protein derivatives  were enhanced during bone-matrix deposition as reported in 14 studies . Inorganic  skeletal matrix biomarkers  indicative of  bone mineralization  showed positive expression in eight studies .  Several biomarkers appear to be useful for the assessment of  bone regeneration  around bio material s. Although biomarkers are capable of independently predicting  bone regeneration  , lack of substantial evidence in the literature limits their true clinical utility . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Noninvasive and inexpensive methods of isolating and characterization of biomarkers from cellular and extracellular skeletal matrix during bone regeneration have proven value in evaluating success of bone bio material."
">Literature regarding the outcome of  maxillary sinus floor elevation  to create sufficient bone fraction to enable implant placement was systematic ally review ed .  Bone fraction and implant survival rate  were assessed to determine whether grafting material or applied growth factor affected bone fraction . Trials where  sinus floor elevations with autogenous bone ( controls ) were compared with autogenous bone combined with growth factors or bone substitutes , or solely with bone substitutes (  test groups ) were identified ;  12 of 1124 fulfilled all inclusion criteria .  Meta-analyses comparing the bone fraction after applying :  autogenous bone ; autologous bone with growth factors ( platelet rich plasma ) ; or autogenous bone and bone substitutes ( bovine hydroxyapatite , bioactive glass , corticocancellous pig bone )  revealed no significant  differences in bone formation  after 5 months . A  significantly higher bone fraction  was found in the autogenous bone group compared to the sole use of β-tricalciumphosphate ( P=0.036 ) .  The one-year overall implant survival rate  showed no significant difference between implants .  Bone substitutes  combined with  autogenous bone  provide a reliable alternative for autogenous bone as sole grafting material to reconstruct maxillary sinus bony deficiencies , for supporting dental implants after 5 months . Adding growth factors ( platelet rich plasma ) to grafting material and the sole use of β-tricalciumphosphate  did not promote bone formation ."
"sAIMS AND OBJECTIVES To explore and summarise best evidence of how constipation affects the daily living of  older people  from their own perspective . Furthermore , to assess how interventions aim ed at treating  constipation in older people  affect  patient-reported outcome  such  as quality of life .  BACKGROUND Constipation is a common and overlooked problem with an impact on everyday life , especially among  older people . Older people  seem to have individual preconceptions on constipation which can influence the strategies used to prevent and treat constipation . DESIGN A systematic review , integrating findings from both qualitative and quantitative studies . METHOD Systematic search es were carried out in PubMed , CINAHL , PsycINFO and EMBASE on the 31st of July 2014 . A search strategy was constructed with key concepts identified using PICO to identify quantitative studies and PIC(o ) to identify qualitative studies . Search terms included  constipation , elderly , aged , elderly people , aged people  ,  quality of  life , patient experience , patient perspective , meaning , emotion , psychological . Reference lists were search ed manually . RESULTS A  total  of  nine studies were included  in the review , five quantitative and four qualitative . Three main themes crystallised from the results of the included studies :  bodily experiences , everyday life  shadowed  by constipation  and  adverse psychological effects .   Constipation  among older people  was connected to subjective and comprehensive experiences . It had a negative impact on physical and mental well-being as well as the social life of older people . The review also showed that older people had individual and personal strategies , based on their own beliefs . RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the experiences of living with constipation as well as the range of strategies used by patients to prevent and treat constipation . The patient perspective on constipation needs to be integrated in the strategies and actions carried out by healthcare professionals."

"dThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of  pre-exercise low-level phototherapy ( Light-Emitting Diode therapy [ LEDtherapy ] or Light Amplification by Stimulate Emission of Radiation therapy [ LASERtherapy ] )  in increasing  exercise capacity  and  muscle performance  of  people undergoing exercise  when compared to  placebo  treatment  .  R and omized controlled trials and crossover studies were sought on CENTRAL , MEDLINE , EMBASE , SciELO , PEDro and LILACS from its inception up to February 2015 . References lists of included studies were sought for additional relevant research . Two authors independently extracted  data  on  study design , treatment parameters , exercise capacity ( number of repetitions , time to exhaustion , blood lactate concentration and lactate dehydrogenase activity ) and muscle performance ( torque , power and strength )  using an structured table . Agreement should be reached by consensus or by a third review er .  Sixteen studies involving 297 participants were included .  Improvement  of number of repetitions  ( mean difference [ MD ] [ 95 % confidence interval ] = 3.51 repetitions [ 0.65–6.37 ] ; P = 0.02 ) ,  delay in time to exhaustion  ( MD = 4.01 s [ 2.10–5.91 ] ;  P < 0.0001 )  ,  reduction in lactate levels  ( MD = 0.34 mmol/L [ 0.19–0.48 ] ; P < 0.00001 ) and  increased peak torque  ( MD = 21.51 Nm [ 10.01–33.01 ] ; P < 0.00001 ) were observed when  LASERtherapy  was applied .  LEDtherapy  meta-analyses were performed with two studies and retrieved no between-group statistically significant  difference in power , lactate levels or time to exhaustion .  Although our results suggest that  LASERtherapy  is effective in improving skeletal muscle exercise capacity , the quality of the current evidence is limited."
"ePurpose . To make recommendations for the use of  doxorubicin-based chemotherapy  in  patients with soft-tissue sarcoma .  Patients . The recommendations apply to  patients with symptomatic unresectable locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma who are c and i date s for palliative chemotherapy .  Methods . A systematic review of the published literature was combined with a consensus process around the interpretation of the evidence in the context of conventional practice to develop an evidence -based practice guideline . Results .  Eight r and omized trials  comparing  doxorubicin-based combination versus doxorubicin single-agent chemotherapy  were review ed .  Response rates and overall survival  were evaluated using pooled statistical analysis .The  pooled response data in 2281 patients  showed a slight trend favouring the combination therapy , although this did not reach statistical significance ( odds ratio ( OR ) , 0.79 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.60 - 1.05 ; p=0.10 ) .  Survival data  could only be abstract ed from  six studies involving 2097 patients  , and showed no significant advantage for combination therapy ( OR , 0.84 ; 95 % CI , 0.67 - 1.06 ; p=0.13 ) . Data on  adverse effects  could not be combined in a meta- analysis ; however  nausea , vomiting and myelosuppression  were consistently more severe with  combination chemotherapy  than with  single-agent chemotherapy .  Discussion .  Single-agent doxorubicin  is an appropriate first-line chemotherapy option for advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma . Some  doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy regimens  , given in conventional doses , produce only marginal increases in  response rates  , at the expense of increased  adverse effects  , and with no improvements in  overall survival .  Future r and omized clinical trials should compare new regimens , whose activity has been established in single-arm studies , with  single-agent doxorubicin  , and include  quality of life  as an outcome measure."
"eBACKGROUND A  quadrivalent influenza vaccine ( QIV )  includes two A strains ( A/H1N1 , A/H3N2 ) and two B lineages ( B/Victoria , B/Yamagata ) . The presence of both B lineages eliminate potential B lineage mismatch of  trivalent influenza vaccine  ( TIV ) with the circulating strain . METHODS Electronic data base search es of Medline , Embase , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CC RCT ) , Scopus and Web of Science were conducted for  articles published until June 30 , 2015 inclusive . Articles were limited to r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) in adults using  inactivated intramuscular vaccine  and published in English language only .  Summary estimates  of immunogenicity ( by seroprotection and seroconversion rates ) and adverse events  outcomes were compared between QIV and TIV , using a risk ratio ( RR ) . Studies were pooled using inverse variance weights with a r and om effect model and the I(2 ) statistic was used to estimate heterogeneity . RESULTS A  total of five RCTs  were included in the meta- analysis . For  immunogenicity outcomes  , QIV had similar  efficacy  for the three common strains ; A/H1N1 , A/H3N2 and the B lineage included in the TIV . QIV also showed  superior efficacy  for the B lineage not included in the TIV  ; pooled seroprotection  RR of 1.14 ( 95%CI : 1.03 - 1.25 , p=0.008 ) and seroconversion RR of 1.78 ( 95%CI : 1.24 - 2.55 , p=0.002 ) for B/Victoria , and  pooled seroprotection  RR of 1.12 ( 95%CI : 1.02 - 1.22 , p=0.01 ) and  seroconversion  RR of 2.11 ( 95%CI : 1.51 - 2.95 , p<0.001 ) for B/Yamagata , respectively . No significant differences were found between QIV and TIV for  aggregated local and systemic adverse events  within 7days post-vaccination . There were no vaccine-related  serious adverse events  reported for either QIV or TIV . Compared to TIV ,  injection-site pain  was more common for QIV , with a pooled RR of 1.18 ( 95%CI : 1.03 - 1.35 , p=0.02 ) .  In  adults  , inactivated QIV was as immunogenic as seasonal TIV , with equivalent efficacy against the shared three strains included in TIV , and a superior immunogenicity against the non-TIV B lineage."
">Abstract Maternal psychological state is recognised to influence lactation success , largely by affecting  milk ejection .  Thus , increased psychological distress can disrupt  milk flow  and in the long‐term , affect  milk synthesis  . Conversely , it is possible that  milk ejection  could be improved by using  relaxation therapy  during breastfeeding . We performed a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions using  relaxation therapy  to improve  breastfeeding  outcomes and to assess the consequent impact(s ) on  infant growth and behaviour .  A literature search was performed using the PRISMA guidelines where we included intervention studies ( including nonr and omised controlled studies ) using  relaxation therapy  in  breastfeeding mothers during the post‐natal period . Out of 147 identified records at the initial search , 5 studies were eligible  , of which 3 were  r and omised controlled  trials and 2 were  nonr  and  omised  or quasi‐experimental studies . These studies were conducted in  Europe , America , and India and included 311 mother – infant pairs , of which 64 infants were full‐term and 247 were premature infants .   Relaxation therapy  was shown to  increase milk yield  in mothers  of preterm infants  in 2 r and omised trials , however , the milk sampling protocol for these studies could be question ed . None of the studies investigated the consequent  effects on infant outcomes  . Overall , limited evidence was found on  the  effectiveness of relaxation therapy  on breast milk composition and infant outcomes  . Experimental studies with better st and ardisation of protocol and robust method ological design are needed to investigate the effectiveness  of relaxation therapy  on  both breastfeeding and infant growth and behavioural outcomes ."
"tR and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) evaluating the management of  acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD )  report heterogeneous outcome measures , thus rendering their results incomparable , complicating their translation into clinical practice . As a first step in the development of a core outcome set that will aim to homogenise outcome measures in future RCTs , we assessed the outcomes reported in recent relevant RCTs and systematic review s. We conducted a method ological systematic review ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ prospero / registration number CRD42016052437 ) of RCTs  and systematic review  s on  COPD exacerbation  management indexed on Medline and PubMed during the last decade . We evaluated their methodology , specifically focusing on the reported outcome measures . Based  on 123 RCTs and 38 systematic review s  , we found significant variability in the outcomes reported and in their definition .  Mortality  , which was assessed in 82 % of the included trials , was the most frequently assessed outcome , followed by the  rate of treatment success or failure  ( 63 % ) ,  adverse events  ( 59 % ) ,  health status , symptoms and quality of life  ( 59 % ) ,  lung function  ( 47 % ) , and  duration of exacerbations  ( 42 % ) . The significant heterogeneity in the selection and definition of outcome measures in RCTs and systematic review s limits the interpretability and comparability of their results , and warrants the development of a core outcome set for COPD exacerbations management."
"yBackground  Biological therapies  represent a fundamental innovation for the management of inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBD ) . However , many biological originators have reached , or are about to reach , patent expiry and long-term therapy costs have become progressively unsustainable .  CT-P13  , a biosimilar of the anti-tumor necrosis factor ( anti-TNF ) monoclonal antibody infliximab , might represent a significant alternative to its originator , with the potential to decrease medical care costs and , therefore , become available to a large number of patients . Objectives In this systematic review , we analyzed the data from available clinical trials that recently investigated the validity of indication extrapolation of  CT-P13  for the treatment of  IBD in naïve patients and in patients who switched from its originator infliximab  , focusing on clinical efficacy , safety and immunogenicity . Methods A detailed literature search was developed a priori to identify articles that investigated the validity of indication extrapolation of  CT-P13  for the treatment of  IBD in TNF inhibitor treatment-naïve patients and in patients who switched from the originator  infliximab  .  This was applied to Ovid MEDLINE , In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations , EMBASE , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and Scopus for content from 2012 to September 2016 . Results We based our review on the available data from  11 studies that included a total of 1007 IBD patients : 570 patients suffering from Crohn ’s disease ( 294 switched and 276 naïve ) , 435 patients suffering from ulcerative colitis ( 127 switched and 308 naïve ) , and two IBD unclassified patients ( switched ) .  Overall , no significant difference in  efficacy and safety  between the originator  infliximab  and its biosimilar  CT-P13  was observed . When assessing the  safety  of  CT-P13  , we found that 9.2 % of patients  experienced adverse effects  ( 4.1 % infusion-related reactions and 4.3 % infections ) . Conclusion The analyzed studies did not report a significant difference in terms of  efficacy , safety and immunogenicity  when comparing the clinical experience with  CT-P13  with the available literature data on the originator treatment in IBD . However , some debate is ongoing regarding interchangeability and immunogenicity."

"sThere are now about 50 r and omized controlled trials into  rehabilitation packages , physiotherapy  or  related specific and non-specific techniques  in  multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .  Generally these , and related systematic review s , report benefits . Particular problems arise , however , with the blinding of assessment , determination of what is the active or beneficial input by the therapist , the use of multiple domains of assessment of  quality of life  and  function  without , sometimes , a clear statement of a trial hypothesis or primary outcome and the short-term nature of many studies . Therapy inputs can be broadly broken down into  verbal interactions with the patient , physical inputs and referral/ recommendation processes .  Each may be relevant to the outcome .  ‘ Response-shift ’  may be an important internal mechanism of mind whereby changes in  ‘ quality of life ’  may not always parallel function emphasizing the case for clearly separating  quality of life  from  functional assessment  and attempting to make the latter as objective as possible . Trials of such complex interventions will need to r and omize specified components of therapy against appropriate placebos or active treatment arms rather than no therapy , which will be ethically harder to sustain . Classification of physiotherapy inputs by type and ‘ dosage ’ , a primary hypothesis under test and attention to concealed allocation of treatment , assessor blinding and intention to treat analysis together with improved measurements of function will assist in the consolidation of the evidence base for physiotherapy as an important component of management for MS patients."
"sSocial  marketing  is a commonly used strategy in global health .  Social marketing programmes  may sell subsidized products through commercial sector outlets , distribute appropriately priced products , deliver health services through social franchises and promote behaviours not dependent upon a product or service . We aim ed to review evidence of the effectiveness of  social marketing  in  low- and middle-income countries  , focusing on major areas of investment in global health : HIV , reproductive health , child survival , malaria and tuberculosis . We search ed PubMed , PsycInfo and ProQuest , using search terms linking social  marketing  and health outcomes for  studies published from 1995 to 2013 .  Eligible studies used  experimental or quasi-experimental design s  to measure  outcomes of behavioural factors , health behaviours and /or health outcomes  in each health area . Studies were analysed by effect estimates and for application of social marketing benchmark criteria .  After review ing 18 974 records , 125 studies met inclusion criteria .  Across health areas , 81 studies reported on changes in  behavioural factors  , 97 studies reported on  changes in behaviour  and 42 studies reported on  health outcomes .  The greatest number of studies focused on  HIV outcomes   ( n = 45 )  and took place in  sub-Saharan Africa ( n = 67 ) .  Most studies used quasi-experimental design s and reported mixed results .  Child survival  had proportionately the greatest number of studies using experimental design s , reporting health outcomes , and reporting positive , statistically significant results . Most programmes used a range of methods to promote behaviour change . Programmes with positive , statistically significant findings were more likely to apply audience insights and cost-benefit analyses to motivate behaviour change . Key evidence gaps were found in  voluntary medical male circumcision and childhood pneumonia .   Social marketing  can influence  health behaviours and health outcomes  in global health ; however evaluations assessing health outcomes remain comparatively limited . Global health investments are needed to ( i ) fill evidence gaps , ( ii ) strengthen evaluation rigour and ( iii ) exp and effective social marketing approaches."
"dObjective : To systematic ally review instruments for measuring the  level and effectiveness of sedation  in  adult and pediatric ICU patients .¶  Study identification : We search ed MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cochrane Library and reference lists of the relevant articles . We selected studies if the sedation instrument reported items related to consciousness and one or more additional items related to the effectiveness or side effects of sedation.¶ Data abstract ion : We extracted data on the description of the instrument and on their measurement properties ( internal consistency , reliability , validity and responsiveness).¶ Results : We identified  25  studies describing relevant sedation instruments . In addition to the  level of consciousness , agitation and synchrony with the ventilator  were the most frequently assessed aspects of sedation . Among the 25 instruments , one developed in  pediatric ICU patients  ( the  Comfort  Scale ) , and 3 developed in  adult ICU patients  ( the  Ramsay scale , the Sedation-Agitation-Scale and the Motor Activity Assessment Scale )  , were tested for both  reliability and validity  . None of these instruments were tested for their ability to detect  change in sedation status  over time (responsiveness).¶ Conclusion : Many instruments have been used to measure  sedation effectiveness  in ICU patients . However , few of them exhibit satisfactory clinimetric properties . To help clinicians assess sedation at the bedside , to aid readers critically appraise the growing number of sedation studies in the ICU literature , and to inform the design of future investigations , additional information about the measurement properties of  sedation effectiveness  instruments is needed."

"eSummary  Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea ( OSAH )  causes excessive daytime sleepiness , impairs quality  -of-life  , and increases cardiovascular disease and road traffic accident risks .  Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment and m and ibular advancement devices ( MAD )  have been shown to be effective in individual trials but their effectiveness particularly relative to disease severity is unclear . A MEDLINE , Embase and Science Citation Index search updating two systematic review s to August 2013  identified 77 RCTs in adult OSAH patients  comparing :  MAD with conservative management ( CM ) ; MAD with CPAP ; or CPAP with CM .  Overall MAD and CPAP significantly  improved apnoea-hypopnoea index ( AHI )  ( MAD −9.3/hr ( p < 0.001 ) , CPAP −25.4 ( p < 0.001 ) ) . In direct comparisons  mean AHI and Epworth sleepiness scale score  were lower ( 7.0/hr ( p < 0.001 ) and 0.67 ( p = 0.093 ) respectively ) for CPAP . There were no CPAP vs. MAD trials in mild OSAH but in comparisons with CM , MAD and CPAP  reduced ESS  similarly ( MAD 2.01 ( p < 0.001 ) ; CPAP 1.23 ( p = 0.012 ) . Both MAD and CPAP are clinical ly effective in the treatment of OSAH . Although CPAP has a greater treatment effect , MAD is an appropriate treatment for patients who are intolerant of CPAP and may be comparable to CPAP in mild disease."
"  M and  ibular advancement devices are clinical ly effective and  cost-effective  in mild to moderate OSAH . A semi-bespoke MAD is the appropriate first choice in most patients in the short term . Future work should explore whether or not adjustable MADs give additional clinical and cost benefits . Further data on longer-term cardiovascular risk and its risk factors would reduce uncertainty in the health economic model and improve precision of effectiveness estimates .

"sThis systematic review aims to analyze the state-of-the-art regarding interaction modalities used on   serious games  for upper limb rehabilitation .  A systematic search was performed in IEEE Xplore and Web of Science data bases . PRISMA and QualSyst protocol s were used to filter and assess the articles .  Articles must meet the following inclusion criteria : they must be written in English ; be at least four pages in length ; use or develop serious games ; focus on upper limb rehabilitation ; and be published between 2007 and 2017 . Of 121 articles initially retrieved , 33 articles met the inclusion criteria .  Three interaction modalities were found :  vision systems  ( 42.4 % ) ,  complementary vision systems  ( 30.3 % ) , and  no-vision systems  ( 27.2 % ) .  Vision systems and no-vision systems  obtained a similar  mean QualSyst  ( 86 % ) followed by  complementary vision systems  ( 85.7 % ) . Almost half of the studies used   vision systems   as the interaction modality ( 42.4 % ) and used the  Kinect sensor  to collect the  body movements  ( 48.48 % ) . The shoulder was the most treated body part in the studies ( 19 % ) . A key limitation of  vision systems and complementary vision systems  is that their  device performances  might be affected by lighting conditions . A main limitation of the  no-vision systems  is that the  range-of-motion in angles of the body movement  might not be measured accurately . Due to a limited number of studies , fruitful areas for further research could be the following : serious games focused on finger rehabilitation and trauma injuries , game  difficulty  adaptation based on user 's muscle  strength  and posture , and multisensor data fusion on interaction modalities."
" Large numbers of overlapping review s related to interventions to improve  upper limb function  following stroke have been identified , and this overview serves to signpost clinicians and policy makers toward relevant systematic review s to support clinical decisions , providing one accessible , comprehensive document , which should support clinicians and policy makers in clinical decision making for stroke rehabilitation . Currently , no high- quality evidence can be found for any interventions that are currently used as part of routine practice , and evidence is insufficient to enable comparison of the relative effectiveness of interventions . Effective collaboration is urgently needed to support large , robust RCTs of interventions currently used routinely within clinical practice . Evidence related to dose of interventions is particularly needed , as this information has widespread clinical and research implication."
"FBackground This meta- analysis compared the effects of  non-invasive ventilation ( NIV )  with  invasive mechanical ventilation ( InMV ) and st and ard oxygen ( O2 )  therapy on  mortality and rate of tracheal intubation  in  patients presenting acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) .  Methods We search ed the MEDLINE , EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials data bases between 1949 and May 2015 to identify  r and omized  trials of   NIV  for ARF .  We excluded the  ARF caused by extubation , cardiogenic pulmonary edema , and COPD .  Results The meta- analysis included  21 studies and 1691 patients , of whom 846 were assigned to  NIV  and 845 to  control (  InMV or st and ard O2 therapy ) .   One hundred ninety-one patients ( 22.6 % ) in the  NIV  group and 261 patients ( 30.9 % ) in the  control  group  died   before discharge from hospital . The  pooled odds ratio ( OR ) for short-term mortality ( in-hospital mortality )  was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.40–0.78 ) . When comparing  NIV  with  st and ard O2 therapy  ,  the short-term mortality  was 155 ( 27.4 % ) versus 204 ( 36.0 % ) , respectively . For this comparison , the  pooled OR of short-term mortality  was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.36–0.85 ) . When comparing  NIV  with  InMV  , the  short-term mortality  was 36 ( 12.9 % ) versus 57 ( 20.5 % ) patients , respectively . For this comparison , the  pooled OR of short-term mortality  was 0.56 ( 95 % CI 0.34–0.90 ) .  Tracheal intubation  was performed in 106 patients ( 22.7 % ) in the NIV and in 183 patients ( 39.4 % ) in the  st and ard O2  group , representing a pooled OR of 0.37 ( 95 % CI 0.25–0.55 ) . There were publication biases and the quality of the evidence was grade d as low . Conclusion Compared with  st and ard O2 therapy  or  InMV , NIV  lowered both the  short-term mortality and the rate of tracheal intubation  in patients presenting with ARF."
"tObstructive  sleep  apnoea ( OSA ) is a prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome . Endothelial dysfunction is one of the proposed mechanistic links between OSA and the increased cardiovascular risk . Treatment with  continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP )  may reverse this detrimental pathophysiological consequence of OSA . Most studies on the effect of  CPAP  on  endothelial function  in OSA are limited by their low sample size . The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effect  CPAP therapy  on  endothelial function  in  patients with OSA .  We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis search ing literature data bases up to  August 2013  for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on the effect of  CPAP  on  endothelial function  in OSA , assessed by flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ) and other vali date d techniques . The primary outcome for the meta- analysis ( DerSimonian/Laird r and om-effects method ) was the  treatment effect on FMD .   Eight RCTs  comparing the effects of therapeutic  CPAP  versus subtherapeutic  CPAP  ( or no intervention ) on   endothelial function  involving 245 OSA patients  were included in the systematic review . The studies are consistent in effect direction , showing an improvement of  endothelial function  by  CPAP .   Four RCTs involving 150 patients  could be used for the meta- analysis . Compared to the  control group , CPAP therapy  ( range 2 - 24 weeks ) significantly increased  absolute % FMD  by 3.87 % ( 95 % confidence interval : 1.93 - 5.80 , P < 0.001 ) . In  patients with OSA   , CPAP therapy  improves  endothelial function  significantly and to a clinical ly important extent."
")BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  Opioid use disorder ( OUD )  is a chronic disease with significant personal , societal , and public health consequences . Even for the minority who receive the most effective evidence -based treatments ,  morbidity  , and  mortality  remain significant . These facts , along with the recovery movement calling for individualized , holistic , culturally sensitive care , have led to the exploration of  adjunctive interventions  including  acupuncture .  Despite hundreds of international trials , however , there is a lack of consensus regarding its  efficacy  in OUD due in large part to method ological issues of trials to date . In response to these issues , the National  Acupuncture Detoxification  Association ( NADA ) developed an operationalized manual auricular  acupuncture protocol  that has since become the most widely used in the US . This systematic review is the first to focus explicitly on r and omized trials utilizing the  NADA protocol  as a complementary intervention to address OUD . METHODS The methods utilized to identify studies for inclusion are based on a 2009 protocol developed by the Cochrane Collaboration . RESULTS  Four trials  met inclusion criteria . Despite method ological issues , results indicate that while the  NADA  protocol may not be effective in reducing  acute opiate craving or withdrawal  , it may be effectively utilized as an adjunctive treatment to increase  treatment retention and decrease methadone detoxification and maintenance dosages  in OUD .  AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE Incorporation of the  NADA protocol  into existing evidence -based treatment approaches may facilitate  recovery  and , through its impact on  treatment retention and completion  , indirectly impact  morbidity , and mortality  in  individuals with OUD .  Given the limitations of the current review , conclusions are tentative and directions for future research are discussed . ( Am J Addict 2016;25:592 - 602 )."
"sCurrent  nutrition therapy  recommendations for the prevention and treatment of diabetes are based on a systematic review of evidence and answer important nutrition care questions . First , is  diabetes nutrition therapy  effective ? Clinical trials as well as systematic and Cochrane review s report a ~1%-2 % lowering of  hemoglobin A1c values  as well as other beneficial outcomes from  nutrition therapy interventions  , depending on the type and duration of diabetes and level of glycemic control . Clinical trials also provide evidence for the effectiveness of  nutrition therapy  in the prevention of diabetes . Second , are  weight loss  interventions important and when are they beneficial ?  Modest weight loss  is important for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and early in the disease process . However , as diabetes progresses ,  weight loss  may or may not result in beneficial glycemic and  cardiovascular outcomes  . Third , are there ideal percentages of macronutrients and eating patterns that apply to all persons  with  diabetes ? There is no ideal percentage of macronutrients and a variety of eating patterns has been shown to be effective for persons  with diabetes .  Treatment goals , personal preferences ( eg ,  tradition  ,  culture  ,  religion  ,  health beliefs  ,  economics  ) , and the individual 's ability and willingness to make lifestyle changes must all be considered by clinicians and /or educators when counseling and educating individuals with diabetes . A healthy eating pattern emphasizing nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes , regular physical activity , and support are priorities for all individuals with diabetes . Reduced  energy intake  for  persons with prediabetes  or  type 2 diabetes  as well as matching insulin to planned carbohydrate intake are intervention to be considered . Fourth , is the question of how to implement  nutrition therapy interventions  in clinical practice . This requires nutrition  care  strategies."

"sProtein-energy malnutrition is associated with numerous poor health outcomes , including high  health care costs  , mortality rates and poor physical  functioning in older adults .  This systematic literature review aims to identify and provide an evidence based overview of potential determinants of protein-energy malnutrition in  community-dwelling older adults .  A systematic search was conducted in PUBMED , EMBASE , CINAHL and COCHRANE from the earliest possible date through January 2013 . Observational studies that examined determinants of protein-energy malnutrition were selected and a best evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the results . In total  28 studies were included in this review  from which 122 unique potential determinants were derived .  Thirty-seven determinants were  examined in sufficient number of studies and were included in a best evidence synthesis . The best evidence score comprised design ( cross-sectional , longitudinal ) and quality of the study ( high , moderate ) to grade the evidence level . Strong evidence for an association with  protein-energy  malnutrition was found for  poor appetite  , and moderate evidence for  edentulousness , having no diabetes , hospitalization and poor self-reported health .  Strong evidence for no association was found for  anxiety , chewing difficulty , few friends , living alone , feeling lonely , death of spouse , high number of diseases , heart failure and coronary failure , stroke ( CVA ) and the use of anti-inflammatory medications .  This review shows that protein-energy malnutrition is a multifactorial problem and that different domains likely play a role in the pathway of developing protein-energy malnutrition . These results provide important knowledge for the development of targeted , multifactorial interventions that aim to prevent the development of protein-energy malnutrition in community-dwelling older adults."
" The results of the present research synthesis support the hypothesis that  augmented exercise therapy  has a small but favorable effect on  ADL  , particularly if therapy input is augmented at least 16 hours within the first 6 months after stroke . This meta- analysis also suggests that clinical ly relevant treatment effects may be achieved on instrumental ADL and gait speed."
"rCONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE Around 16 % to 20 % of  women with breast cancer have advanced , metastasized breast cancer .  At this stage , the disease is treatable , but not curable . The objective here was to assess the  effectiveness  of  lapatinib  for treating  patients with advanced or metastasized breast cancer .  DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review of the literature , developed at  Centro Paulista de Economia da Saúde ( CPES ) , Universidade Federal de São Paulo ( Unifesp ) .  METHOD Systematic review with search es in virtual data bases ( PubMed , Lilacs [ Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde ] , Cochrane Library , Scirus and Web of Science ) and manual search . RESULTS Only one clinical trial that met the selection criteria was found . This study showed that  lapatinib  in association with  capecitabine   reduced the risk of cancer progression  by 51 % ( 95 % confidence interval , CI : 0.34 - 0.71 ; P < 0.001 ) , compared with  capecitabine  alone , without any  increase in severe adverse effects .   The combination  of lapatinib plus capecitabine  was more  effective  than  capecitabine  alone for reducing the  risk of cancer progression  . Further r and omized clinical trials need to be carried out with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of lapatinib as monotherapy or in association for first-line or second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer."
" We were able to use high-level evidence from  patients receiving rt as definitive or postoperative treatment  to generate recommendations for the use of systemic therapy in the treatment of lascchn . A limitation is a lack of stratification for human papillomavirus-related cancers of the oropharynx . One rct provided evidence for the use of cetuximab as an alternative to chemotherapy in the definitive rt setting .  Concurrent chemoradiation  provides one strategy for larynx preservation , but the best strategy is unclear . Use of induction chemotherapy does not improve  overall survival  , and its use should be limited to patients requiring immediate tumour downsizing before local therapy."

"nTo obtain precise findings from published studies about the  efficacy and safety  of  glyburide  versus  subcutaneous insulin  in  patients with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) .  We search ed PubMed , Cochrane Library , Web of Science , and Scopus , up to January 2019 , for relevant studies that compared  glyburide  with  subcutaneous insulin  for  patients with GDM .  We extracted maternal  and neonatal  outcomes from included studies , performed meta- analysis , evaluated heterogeneity , assessed the risk of bias of included studies , and conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses . A total of  24 studies ( 11 r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and 13 observational cohort studies ) with a total of 24,517 women were included in the present study .  The pooled estimate showed that  glyburide   significantly decreased the need for cesarean section  ( OR = 0.87 , 95 % CI [ 0.82 , 0.92 ] , p  < 0.0001 ) , fasting blood glucose  ( MD − 5.63 mg/dL , 95 % CI [ − 10.97 , − 0.28 ] ,  p = 0.04 ) , and Apgar score at 5  min ( MD − 0.30 , 95 % CI [ − 0.36 , − 0.23 ] , p < 0.001 ) than  insulin  .  However  ,  glyburide   significantly increased the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia  ( OR = 1.42 , 95 % CI [ 1.03 , 1.95 ] , p  = 0.03 ) and neonatal intensive care unit admission duration  ( NICU ) ( MD 4.26 days , 95 % CI [ 2.65 , 5.86 ] , p < 0.01 ) compared  to  insulin . The overall results did not favor either group in  terms of macrosomia  ( OR = 1.14 , 95 % CI [ 0.92 , 1.41 ] ,  p = 0.25 ) and large for gestational age ( LGA )  ( OR = 1.38 , 95 % CI [ 0.99 , 1.92 ] ,  p = 0.06  ) . While subgroup analysis of RCTs  showed that maternal hypoglycemia and LGA rates  were  significantly  higher  in glyburide than insulin   and  cesarean  section  rates were comparable between both compared groups . Our study suggests  that glyburide   is an effective and well-tolerated  drug compared to  insulin  in the management of  women with GDM  , provided neonates are monitored  for hypoglycemia and Apgar  score . In addition  , glyburide  was  associated with lower cesarean sections  , which may add to the potential clinical ly  benefits of glyburide  compared to insulin."
"nBACKGROUND Our objective was to examine the effect of   antenatal peer support   on  rates of  breastfeeding  initiation .  METHODS We performed a systematic review of r and omized controlled trials , quasi-r and omized trials and cohort studies with concurrent controls . We search ed the Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) , the National Research Register and the British Nursing  Index from inception or from 1980 to 2009 .  We carried out study selection , data abstract ion and quality assessment independently and in duplicate . We defined high- quality studies as those that minimized the risk of at least three of the following types of bias : selection , performance , measurement and attrition bias . We calculated  risk ratios ( RRs  ) and 95 %  confidence intervals  ( CIs ) for individual studies and undertook separate meta-analyses for high- quality trials of  universal peer support  and  targeted peer support .  We did not include low- quality studies . RESULTS We selected  11 studies , which involved 5445 women in total .  Seven of these studies ( involving  4416 women in total )  evaluated  universal peer support  , and  four  studies ( involving  1029 women in total )  targeted  antenatal peer support .  In the three high- quality studies of  universal peer support  , all involving low-income  women  , the  relative risk for not initiating breastfeeding  was 0.96 ( 95 % CI 0.76 - 1.22 ) . In the three high- quality studies of  antenatal peer support  that targeted women considering breastfeeding , the relative  risk  for  not initiating breastfeeding  was 0.64 ( 95 % CI 0.41 - 0.99 ) . INTERPRETATION  Universal antenatal peer support  does not appear to improve  rates of breastfeeding initiation  , but  targeted antenatal peer support  may be beneficial . This effect may be related to context , however , so any new  peer-support  program should undergo concurrent high- quality evaluation."
"sCancer , its therapy , and related adverse effects have been associated with reduced work performance , including  absenteeism  ( i.e. absence from scheduled work due to health problems ) and  presenteeism  ( i.e. impaired on-the-job performance due to health problems ) among  cancer survivors .  This review aim ed to compare the work performance of  employed cancer survivors with that of  cancer-free  controls  , and to examine factors related to the impairment of work performance . The findings from this review could bring about suggestions for clinical interventions aim ed at improving survivors ' work performance . Literature search es on cancer survivors  '  work performance were conducted in three electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , CINAHL and PsycINFO ) .  Twenty-six studies were identified . Most studies comprised survivors of breast , prostate , testicular and gastrointestinal cancer .  Although  survivors diagnosed within 5 years  reported more  absenteeism  than did controls in the studies , there was no difference between controls and  survivors  diagnosed >  5 years earlier  . Survivors diagnosed within 5 years also reported more  presenteeism  than did controls . Many studies reported that the complications related to  cancer  and its therapy ( e.g.  fatigue and depression )  were associated with presenteeism . A multifaceted intervention for the various factors identified in this review would contribute towards improved  work performance  among employed cancer survivors."

"yHealthcare  workers ( HCWs ) in long-term care facilities ( LTCFs )  can represent a source of influenza infection for the  elderly .  While flu  vaccination  coverage ( VC ) is satisfactory in the elderly , HCWs are less likely to be vaccinated . There is no definitive evidence on which types of  healthcare system-based interventions  at  LTCFs  would be more useful in improving the  vaccination uptake  among HCWs . We performed a systematic review in different data bases ( Pubmed , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s , Health Evidence , Web of Science , Cinahl ) to provide a synthesis of the available studies on this topic . Among the  1177 articles screened by their titles and abstract s , 27 were included in this review .  Most of the studies reported multiple interventions addressed to improve access to vaccination , eliminate individual barriers , or introduce policy interventions . As expected ,  m  and atory  vaccinations  seem to be the most useful intervention to increase the  vaccination uptake  in HCWs . However , our study suggests that better results in the  vaccination uptake in HCWs  were obtained by combining interventions in different areas .  Educational campaigns  alone could not have an impact on  vaccination coverage .   LTCFs  represent an ideal setting to perform preventive multi-approach interventions for the epidemiological transition toward aging and chronicity."
"eOBJECTIVE To compare the effects of  unilateral and bilateral training  on  upper limb  function  after stroke  with regard to two key factors : severity of  upper limb paresis  and time of intervention  post-stroke .  DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials . METHODS Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion , assessed the method ological quality and extracted data . Study outcomes were pooled by calculating the ( st and ardized ) mean difference ( (S)MD ) . Sensitivity analyses for severity and time of intervention post-stroke were applied when possible . RESULTS All  9 studies involving 452 patients  showed homogeneity .  In chronic patients with a mild upper limb paresis after stroke  a marginally significant  SMD for upper limb activity performance  ( SMD 0.34 ; 95 % confidence interval ) : 0.04 - 0.63 ) , and marginally significant  MDs  for  perceived upper limb activity performance  ( amount of use : MD 0.42 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.09 - 0.76 , and  quality of movement  : MD 0.45 ; 95 % confidence interval : 0.12 - 0.78 ) were found in favour of  unilateral training  . All other MDs and SMDs were non-significant .   Unilateral and bilateral training  are similarly effective . However , intervention success may depend on severity of upper limb paresis and time of intervention post-stroke."
"nBACKGROUND The bio-psychosocial model of  spinal cord injury  ( SCI ) highlights that  psychosocial care  is of equal importance as  physical rehabilitation  , and should be offered in the earlier stages of inpatient rehabilitation . AIM This systematic review aim ed to identify interventional research regarding  psychosocial care  for  people with SCI during inpatient rehabilitation  and synthesize the evidence of the effects and characteristics of these studies . METHODS A systematic search of relevant literature  published between 1985 to July 2016  was conducted with  six data bases  ( Scopus , MEDLINE , CINAHL , Science Citation Index Exp and ed , PsycINFO , and the  China Academic Journal Full-text  Data base ) . Reference lists of the identified articles were review ed to find additional relevant articles . RESULTS A total of  four r and omized controlled trials and seven non-r and omized controlled trials were  included in this review . The interventions focused on specialized  types of SCI population with relatively high  levels of psychological distress , pain or pressure ulcers .   Studies reported some varied or inconsistent improvements in  participants ' cognitive appraisal , psychosocial adaptation or mental health  but there were no significant effects on their  coping ability .  Due to the heterogeneity of the studies , findings were synthesized narratively without conducting meta- analysis . LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION This review found promising evidence that  approaches to psychosocial care  for  people with SCI  can improve their  cognitive appraisal and psychosocial adaptation .  Significant method ological limitations weakened study findings . Additionally , because studies were conducted in  only a few developed countries  with  subgroups of patients having specific illness characteristics or severity  , their generalizability to the wider SCI population is uncertain . Therefore , future research should adopt more robust study design s to test  psychosocial interventions  for SCI patients with different socio-cultural background s and psychological adjustment conditions in the early stages of rehabilitation."
"eThe authors examined the role of  systemic adjuvant therapy  in  patients with high-risk , resected , primary melanoma .  Outcomes of interest included  overall survival , disease-free survival , adverse effects , and quality of life .  A systematic review of the literature was conducted to locate r and omized controlled trials , practice guidelines , meta-analyses , and review s published between 1980 and 2004 .  Thirty-seven r and omized controlled trials ,  2 meta-analyses , and 1 systematic review were identified that investigated  interferon , levamisole , vaccine , or chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy .  For high-dose  interferon-alpha  , the results from 3 r and omized trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group were pooled , and a meta- analysis of 2-year death rates yielded a risk ratio of 0.85 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.73 - 0.99 ; P = .03 ) . Five r and omized trials comparing low-dose  interferon-alpha  with observation only after surgery did not detect a statistically significant improvement in  overall survival .  A meta- analysis of 4 levamisole trials did not demonstrate a significant  survival benefit  for levamisole over control ; similarly , no  survival benefit  was demonstrated by data from r and omized controlled trials with vaccines ( 9 trials ) or with  chemotherapy  ( 10 trials ) . In this review of the available literature , no systemic  adjuvant therapy  was identified that conferred a significant  overall survival benefit  in  patients with high-risk , resected , primary melanoma .  However ,  high-dose interferon  should be considered in the treatment of these patients , because such therapy is associated with a significant improvement in  disease-free survival  and a  reduction  in  2-year mortality .  Until the results of ongoing trials are available , the authors could not state with confidence whether such therapy benefits patients with microscopically detected , sentinel lymph node-positive disease."
" Moderate- quality evidence suggests that  acupuncture  relieves  pain  better than  sham acupuncture  , as measured at completion of treatment and at short-term follow-up , and that those who received  acupuncture  report less  pain and disability  at short-term follow-up than those on a wait-list . Moderate- quality evidence also indicates that  acupuncture  is more effective than inactive treatment for relieving  pain  at short-term follow-up."

"dBackground : The review is intended to provide the effectiveness of  robotic-assisted gait training ( RAGT )  for  functional gait recovery  in  poststroke survivors  through a systematic review and to provide evidence for  gait speed  improvements through the meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Summary : In this systematic review , PubMed , Web of Science , Wiley Online Library , Science Direct , Science Robotics , Scopus , UpTo Date , MEDLINE , Google Scholar , CINHAL , EMBASE , and EBSCO were review ed to identify relevant RCTs . Articles included in the study were thoroughly examined by 2 independent review ers .  The included RCTs were having a PEDro score between 6 and 8 points .  The initial data base review  yielded 1,371 studies and  , following further screening ;  9 studies finally were selected  for systematic review and meta- analysis . Out of the 9 studies , 4 were on  chronic stroke  and 5 were on  subacute stroke  . The meta- analysis of  gait speed  showed an  effect size value  ranging between –0.91 and 0.64 , with the total effect size of all the studies being –0.12 . During subgroup analysis , the  subacute stroke total effect size  was identified as –0.48 , and the  chronic stroke total effect size  was noted as 0.04 . Meta- analysis revealed no  significant differences  between  RAGT and  conventional gait training  ( CGT ) .  Key Messages : Our systematic review revealed that the  RAGT application  demonstrated a better or similar effect to that  of CGT  in a  poststroke population .  A meta- analysis of gait speed involving all the studies identified here indicated no significant differences between  RAGT and CGT .  However , the sub analysis of chronic stroke survivors showed a slight positive effect of  RAGT  on gait speed."
"wOBJECTIVES Although  acupuncture  has been frequently used for  acute nonspecific low back pain ( LBP )  , relevant systematic review s indicate sparse and inconclusive evidence . This systematic review aim ed at critically evaluating the evidence for/against  acupuncture  for  acute LBP .  METHODS We search ed Medline ,  Central ,  Embase  , 2 Chinese data bases  ,  relevant journals  ,  and trial registries  for  the r and omized-controlled trials of  acupuncture  that  involved  needling for acute/subacute LBP .  Risk of bias was assessed using the assessment tool from the Cochrane Back Review Group and the adequacy of  acupuncture  intervention was evaluated by 2 independent review ers . The studies according to the control types were combined using a r and om-effects model . RESULTS  A total of 11 r and omized-controlled trials ( n=1139 ) were included .  Compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  , acupuncture  may more effectively  improve symptoms of acute LBP  ( 5 studies ; risk ratio , 1.11 ; 95 % confidence interval : 1.06 , 1.16 ) . For  pain  , there exists inconsistent evidence that  acupuncture  is more effective than medication . Compared with  sham acupuncture , acupuncture  may more effectively  relieve pain  ( 2 studies ; mean difference , -9.38 ; 95 % confidence interval : -17.00 , -1.76 ) but not  function/disability .   Acupuncture  appears to be associated with  few side effects  but the evidence is limited . DISCUSSION The current evidence is encouraging in that  acupuncture  may be more effective than medication for symptom improvement or  relieve pain  better than  sham acupuncture  in acute LBP . The present findings should be confirmed by future studies that overcome the method ological limitations of the studies evaluated in our review."
"nAbstract Background  Severe acute malnutrition ( SAM )  affects nearly 20 million children worldwide and is responsible for up to 1 million deaths per year in  children under the age of 5 years .  Current WHO guidelines recommend oral  amoxicillin  for children with uncomplicated malnutrition and parenteral  benzylpenicillin and gentamicin  for those with complicated malnutrition . Because of cost pressures and increasing antimicrobial resistance , the administration of empirical antibiotics for  children with SAM  has recently been debated . Methods A systematic review of the current published literature was undertaken to assess the  efficacy , safety , cost-effectiveness and pharmacokinetics  of  antimicrobial treatment  of  children with SAM  in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses . Results The initial search found  712 papers , eight of which met the inclusion criteria .  Quality  assessment  of the studies was performed as per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation guidelines . International guidelines and clinical data registries were also review ed which identified inconsistencies in current first- and second-line therapies and dosing regimens . Conclusion Current evidence supports the continued use of broad-spectrum oral amoxicillin for treating  children with uncomplicated SAM as out patients .  There is no strong evidence to justify changing the current parenteral therapy guidelines for  children admitted with complicated SAM  , although they should be clarified to harmonise the dosage regimen of amoxicillin for the treatment of SAM to 40 mg/kg twice daily , and to continue  parenteral antimicrobials  beyond 2 days if indicated by the clinical condition."
"nObjective : To evaluate the evidence for the use of  virtual reality  to treat balance and gait impairments in  multiple sclerosis rehabilitation .  Design : Systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials and quasi-r and omized clinical trials . Methods : An electronic search was conducted using the following data bases : MEDLINE ( PubMed ) , Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s ( CDSR ) and ( CINHAL ) . A quality assessment was performed using the PEDro scale . The data were pooled and a meta- analysis was completed . This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ) PRISMA guideline statement . It was registered in the PROSPERO data base ( CRD42016049360 ) . Results : A total of  11 studies  were included . The data were pooled , allowing meta- analysis of seven outcomes of interest .  A total of 466 participants clinical ly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis  were  analysed  . Results showed  that  virtual reality balance training  is more effective than   no   intervention for postural control improvement ( st and  ard mean difference ( SMD ) = −0.64 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = −1.05 , −0.24 ; P = 0.002 ) . However  , significant overall effect  was not showed when compared  with conventional  training ( SMD = −0.04 ; 95 % CI = −0.70 , 0.62 ;  P = 0.90 )  . Inconclusive results were also observed for  gait  rehabilitation .  Conclusion : Virtual reality training  could be considered at least as  effective  as  conventional training  and more effective than no intervention to treat balance and gait impairments in multiple sclerosis rehabilitation."
" The pilot study nature of essentially all the identified  nonphysical contact biofield therapy RCTs  , as reflected by low sample sizes alone , precludes drawing robust conclusions . Given this perspective , the finding that two thirds of the higher-scoring trials demonstrated at least partial effectiveness favors a continued research effort , especially in light of the translational value of biofield clinical trials for studies exploring the nature and physiologic basis of biofield healing."
"sBackground :  Acupuncture treatment  has been employed in China for over 2500 years and it is used worldwide as analgesia in acute and chronic pain .  Acupuncture  is also used in  general anesthesia ( GA ) .  The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to assess the  efficacy  of  electroacupuncture ( EA )  in addition to  GA  in  patients undergoing cardiac surgery .  Methods : We search ed 3 data bases ( Pubmed , Cochrane Library , and Web of Science — from 1965 until January 31 , 2017 ) for r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) including  patients undergoing cardiac surgery and receiving  GA alone or GA + EA .   As primary outcomes , we investigated the association between  GA + EA  approach  and the dosage of intraoperative anesthetic drugs administered , the duration of mechanical ventilation ( MV ) , the postoperative dose of vasoactive drugs , the length of intensive care unit ( ICU ) and hospital stay , and the levels of troponin I and cytokines .  Results : The initial search  yielded 477 citations , but only 7 prospect i ve RCTs enrolling a total of 321 patients were included .  The use  of GA + EA   reduced the dosage of intraoperative anesthetic drugs  ( P < .05 ) , leading to  shorter MV time  ( P < .01 )  and ICU stay  ( P < .05 ) as well as  reduced postoperative dose of vasoactive drugs  ( P < .001 ) . In addition , significantly  lower levels of troponin I  ( P < .01 )  and tumor necrosis factor α  ( P < .01 ) were observed . Conclusion : The complementary use  of EA  for  open-heart  surgery  reduces the duration of MV and ICU stay  , blunts  the inflammatory  response , and might have protective effects on the heart . Our findings stimulate future RCT to provide definitive recommendations."
"eOBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy of  omega-3  in reducing the incidence of  preterm  birth . DATA SOURCES : Search es were performed in MEDLINE , OVID , Scopus , Clinical Trials.gov , the PROSPERO International Prospect i ve Register of Systematic Review s , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with the use of a combination of keywords related to  “ fish oil  , ” “ pregnancy , ” and  “ omega-3 . ”  METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION : We included  all r and omized controlled trials of asymptomatic women with singleton gestations who were r and omized to  prophylactic treatment with either omega-3 supplementation or control ( either placebo or no treatment )  . Exclusion criteria included trials in women with multiple gestations , intrauterine growth restriction , gestational hypertension or preeclampsia at r and omization , prior preterm birth , and trials with polyunsaturated fatty acids as control .  TABULATION , INTEGRATION , AND RESULTS :  Nine r and omized trials including 3,854 eligible women were identified .  Women who  received omega-3  had a similar rate of  preterm birth  before 37 weeks of gestation compared with women in the control group ( 7.7 % compared with 9.1 % , respectively ; relative risk 0.90 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.72–1.11 ) . There were no significant differences in  birth weight , neonatal intensive care unit admission , necrotizing enterocolitis , sepsis , or perinatal death  in the omega-3 compared with control groups , respectively . There were no significant differences in the subgroup analyses , except for the  rate of perinatal death  , which was lower ( 0.3 % compared with 1.2 % ; relative risk 0.27 , 95 % CI 0.09–0.80 ) in the women who  received omega-3  before 21 weeks of gestation and in trials with low risk of bias ( 0.3 % compared with 1.0 % ; relative risk 0.28 , 95 % CI 0.09–0.89 ) compared with women in the control group . However , in no r and omized controlled trial was  perinatal death  the primary outcome .  :  Omega-3 supplementation  during pregnancy does not reduce  the incidence of preterm birth  or improve neonatal outcome."
"nWe systematic ally review ed the current knowledge on  fixed-dose triple therapies  for the treatment of  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD )  , with a specific focus on its efficacy versus  single bronchodilation , double fixed dose combinations  , and  open triple therapies .  Articles were retrieved from PubMed , Embase , and Scopus up to 3 August 2018 .  We selected articles with r and omized controlled or crossover design conducted in patients with COPD and published as full-length articles or scientific letters , evaluating  triple therapy combinations  in a  single or different inhaler   ,  and with efficacy data  versus  monocomponents , double combinations , or open triple therapies .  Our systematic search reported  108 articles , of which 24 trials were finally selected  for  the analysis  . A total of 7 studies with  fixed dose triple therapy combinations  , and 17 studies with  open triple therapies combinations  . Triple  therapy  showed  improvements in lung function [ trough forced expiratory volume ( FEV1 )  ranging from not significant ( NS ) to 147 ml ] ,  health status using the St. George ’s Respiratory Question naire  [ ( SGRQ ) from NS to 8.8 points ] , and  exacerbations  [ risk ratio ( RR ) from NS to 0.59 for all exacerbations ] versus single or double therapies with a variability in the response , depending the specific combination , and the comparison group .

"dThe dem and for  family caregivers  steadily increases as the number of  people receiving hospice and palliative care  rises .  Family caregivers  play a significant role in supporting their loved ones in end-of-life care . However , there is limited evidence about the effectiveness of the interventions for supporting  family caregivers .  This article synthesizes  behavioral and educational interventions  that support  family caregivers in end-of-life care .  A systematic review was conducted and search ed interventional studies published between  2004 and 2014  in PubMed , CINAHL  ,  Embase ,  and  The Cochrane Library electronic data bases .  Fourteen studies were identified and analyzed : 4  educational studies  , 6  cognitive  behavioral therapy  studies  , and 4 psychoeducational studies  . All educational and behavioral interventions had developed structures and treatment manuals and improved  family caregivers ’ outcomes .  The  cognitive behavioral therapy  result ed in more  positive outcomes  than the other 2 interventions . More rigorous r and omized controlled trials are needed to replicate current effective interventions with larger and diverse sample . Future studies need to develop tools for assessing family  caregivers  ’ needs , create consistent and specific tools to effectively measure  family  caregivers  ’ outcomes  , incorporate a  cost-effectiveness analysis  , and find the most efficient intervention format and method."
"DIntroduction Chronic disease in  children  is increasing , including the prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases such as  asthma  ,  cystic fibrosis ( CF )  ,  bronchiectasis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) .  The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to evaluate the effects of  exercise training  on  health outcomes  in  children with chronic respiratory disease .  Method Five data bases were search ed for r and omised controlled trials investigating the effects of  exercise training  on  children with chronic respiratory disease .  Following the PRISMA guidelines , eligible studies were identified and data were extracted . A meta- analysis was conducted for the  outcomes cardiovascular fitness , lung function and quality of life ( QoL ) .  Results The initial search  returned 3688 papers . Twenty-seven ( 17 in children with asthma , 10 in children with CF ) were included  in the systematic review and 24 of these were included in the meta- analysis . No studies were identified in children with bronchiectasis or BPD . Included  papers had a total of 1009 participants aged 8 - 20 years .  In addition to cardiovascular fitness , lung function and QoL , studies also assessed  pulmonary function , respiratory muscle strength , muscular strength and inflammation .  Meta- analysis showed a large significant  effect size  in favour of  exercise  for  cardiovascular fitness  ( peak VO2 ) ( st and ard mean difference (SMD)=1.16 , 95 % CI 0.61 to 1.70 ) and  QoL  ( SMD=1.27 , 95 % CI 0.72 to 1.82 ) as well as a small , non-significant effect size for  lung function ( FEV1 )  ( SMD=0.02 , 95 % CI -0.38 to 0.42 ) . Conclusion  Exercise training  significantly improves  cardiovascular fitness and QoL  in  children with asthma and CF .  Further research is needed , particularly in children with bronchiectasis and BPD."

"sMany new biologics are being studied for use in  psoriasis .  In this review , we evaluate and summarize findings about emerging biologic  therapies  for  psoriasis .  We review ed published data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of 2  IL-17 inhibitors ( ixekizumab and brodalumab ) ; 3 IL-23 inhibitors ( guselkumab , tildrakizumab , and risankizumab ) ;  and 1  tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitor ( certolizumab pegol ) .  Janus kinase  inhibitors  were not included in our review , as they currently are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and there are no plans to further develop this class for treatment of psoriasis . Overall , the clinical improvement provided by and the  safety profiles  of these agents are promising ; they may be equal to or more  efficacious  than available therapeutic options for treating the  symptoms of psoriasis .  Long-term studies are still needed , however , to further establish  safety and efficacy profiles  for these biologic agents."
"sIntroduction Exclusive Breastfeeding ( EBF ) rates remain low in both  low-income and high-income countries  despite World Health Organization recommendations for EBF till 6 months . Breastfeeding has been shown to have a protective effect against gastrointestinal infections , among other benefits . Large-scale interventions focusing on educating mothers about breastfeeding have the potential to increase breastfeeding prevalence , especially EBF , up to recommended st and ards and also to decrease infant morbidity . Methods A systematic literature search was conducted for RCTs and quasi-experimental studies comparing  breastfeeding education or support to routine care .  The effect of interventions was observed for exclusive , predominant , partial and no breastfeeding rates . The time intervals of interest were day 1 , < 1 month , and 1 to 5 months . Outcome -specific evidence was grade d according to the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group ( CHERG ) rules using the adapted Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) criteria and recommendations were made from studies in  developing countries  for inclusion into the Lives Saved Tool ( LiST ) model . Results After review ing  4600 abstract s , 372 studies were selected for full text screening and 110 of these studies were finally included .  Statistically significant increases in  EBF rates  as a result of  breastfeeding promotion interventions  were observed : 43 % at day 1 , 30 % at < 1 month , and 90 % at 1 - 5 months .  Rates of ‘ no breastfeeding ’  reduced by 32 % at 1 day , 30 % at < 1 month , and 18 % at 1 - 5 months . The effect of interventions on the  rates of predominant and partial breastfeeding  were non-significant .  Conclusion Breastfeeding education and /or support  increased  EBF rates  and decreased  no breastfeeding rates  at birth , < 1 month and 1 - 5 months .  Combined individual and group counseling  appeared to be superior to  individual  or  group counseling  alone . Interventions in developing countries had a greater impact than those in developed countries."

Future studies targeting providers should measure relevant provided-related outcomes and their impact on patient outcomes , to determine overall efficacy."
"sAIM The aim of this study is to determine what factors have been shown , in prospect i ve studies , to predict the incidence of asthma . METHODS We performed a systematic review of peer- review ed literature from  1994 to 2004  to determine what factors predict the  development  of  asthma in both children and adults .  This search strategy yielded  40 studies , with 36  providing some  estimate of asthma incidence  for the  total sample  and or a specific subgroup . RESULTS Annual estimated incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma ranged from 0.6 to 29.5 per 1000 persons . Risk factors for incident asthma among children included : male sex , atopic sensitization , parental history of asthma , early-life stressors and infections , obesity , and exposure to indoor allergens , tobacco smoke and outdoor pollutants . Risk factors for adult-onset asthma included female sex , airway hyperresponsiveness , lifestyle factors , and work-related exposures .  Risk factors for asthma include both modifiable and nonmodifiable ones , and they vary between children and adults . This review of prospect i ve evidence supports  tobacco and smoke avoidance  as an intervention for the primary prevention of childhood asthma . During adolescence and adulthood , targeting  lifestyle factors  like  obesity and smoking  or  reducing occupational exposures  are the best opportunities for asthma prevention . Before specific public health recommendations can be made , however , additional longitudinal research is needed to better characterize target population s and identify appropriate setting s for multifaceted asthma interventions."

"mPurpose This systematic review was intended to identify the effectiveness and inclusion of essential components of  self-management education interventions  to support  patients with cancer  in developing the skills needed for effective self-management of their disease and the acute or immediate , long-term , and late harmful effects of treatments . Methods  Self-management education interventions  were included if they were r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) containing at least one of the eight core elements outlined by the research team . A systematic search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE ( 2005 through April 2015 ) , Embase ( 2005 to 2015 , week 15 ) , the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s ( Issue 4 , April 2015 ) , CINAHL ( 2005 to 2015 ) and PsychINFO ( 2005 to 2015 ) . Keywords search ed include  ‘ self-management patient education ’  or  ‘ patient education ’  . Results  Forty-two RCTs  examining   self-management  education interventions for patients with cancer were identified .  Heterogeneity of interventions precluded meta- analysis , but narrative qualitative synthesis suggested that self-management education interventions  improve symptoms of fatigue , pain , depression , anxiety , emotional distress and quality of life .  Results for specific combinations of core elements were inconclusive . Very few studies used the same combinations of core elements , and among those that did , results were conflicting . Thus , conclusions as to the components or elements of  self-management education interventions  associated with the strength of the effects could not be assessed by this review . Conclusion Defining the core components of cancer self-management education and the fundamental elements for inclusion in supporting effective self-management will be critical to ensure consistent and effective provision of self-management support in the cancer system."
" It is our firm opinion , that since biosimilars are not identical , emphasis must be placed on the quality of the comparative clinical trials performed and the quality of the analytical studies in order to guarantee patient safety .

">Objective To summarise the available evidence for the efficacy of  neuromuscular training  in enhancing sensorimotor and functional deficits in  subjects with chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) .  Design Systematic review with best evidence synthesis . Data Sources An electronic search was conducted through December 2009 , limited to  studies published in the English language  , using the Pubmed , CINAHL , Embase , and SPORTD iscus data bases . Reference screening of all included articles was also undertaken . Methods Studies were selected if the design was a RCT , quasi RCT , or a CCT  ; the patients were adolescents or adults with confirmed CAI ; and one of the treatment options consisted  of a   neuromuscular training programme .   The primary investigator independently assessed the risk of study bias and extracted relevant data . Due to clinical heterogeneity , data was analysed using a best- evidence synthesis . Results  Fourteen studies were included in the review .  Meta- analysis with statistical pooling of data was not possible , as the studies were considered too heterogeneous . Instead a best evidence synthesis was undertaken . There is limited to moderate evidence to support improvements in  dynamic postural stability , and patient perceived functional stability  through  neuromuscular training  in  subjects with CAI .  There is limited evidence of effectiveness for  neuromuscular training  for improving  static postural stability , active and passive joint position sense ( JPS ) , isometric strength , muscle onset latencies , shank/rearfoot coupling , and a reduction in injury recurrence rates .  There is limited evidence of no effectiveness for improvements in  muscle fatigue  following neuromuscular intervention . Conclusion There is limited to moderate evidence of effectiveness in favour of  neuromuscular training  for various measures of  static and dynamic postural stability , active and passive JPS , isometric strength , muscle onset latencies , shank/rearfoot coupling and injury recurrence rates .  Strong evidence of effectiveness was lacking for all outcome measures . All but one of the studies included in the review were deemed to have a high risk of bias , and most studies were lacking sufficient power . Therefore , in future we recommend conducting higher quality RCTs using appropriate outcomes to assess for the effectiveness of  neuromuscular training  in overcoming sensorimotor deficits in subjects with  CAI ."
"hDuring  pregnancy  ,  vitamin D supplementation  may be a feasible strategy to help prevent   low  birthweight (  LBW  ) and small for gestational age ( SGA ) births  . However , evidence from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) is inconclusive , probably due to heterogeneity in study design and type of intervention . A systematic literature search in the PubMed - Medline , EMBASE , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials data bases was carried out to evaluate the effects of  oral vitamin D supplementation  during pregnancy on  birthweight , birth length , head circumference , LBW , and SGA .  The fixed-effects or r and om-effects models were used to  calculate mean difference ( MD ) , risk ratio ( RR ) , and 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI )  . On a total of 13 RCTs , maternal  vitamin  D supplementation had a positive effect  on birthweight  ( 12 RCTs ; MD = 103.17 g , 95 % CI 62.29⁻144.04 g ) ,  length  ( 6 RCTs ; MD = 0.22 cm , 95 % CI 0.11⁻0.33 cm ) ,  and head  circumference ( 6 RCTs ; MD:0.19 cm , 95 % CI 0.13⁻0.24 cm ) . In line with these findings , we also demonstrated that maternal vitamin D supplementation reduced  the risk of LBW  ( 3 RCTs ; RR = 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.22⁻0.74 )  and SGA  ( 5 RCTS ; RR = 0.69 , 95 % CI 0.51⁻0.92 ) . The present systematic review and meta- analysis confirmed the well-established effect  of maternal  vitamin  D   supplementation on birth size  . However , further research is required to better define risks and benefits associated with such interventions and the potential implication s for public health."
"sBackground :  Self-care  is an important element in the comprehensive management of  patients with heart failure .  The European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale ( EHFScBS ) was developed and tested to measure behaviours performed by the  heart failure patients  to maintain life , healthy functioning , and wellbeing . Aims : The purpose of this review was to evaluate the importance of factors associated with heart failure  self-care behaviours  as measured by the EHFScBS  .  Methods : Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis guidelines were used to search major health data bases ( PubMed , Scopus and ScienceDirect ) . Obtained associating factors of heart failure self-care were qualitatively synthesis ed and the association levels of most commonly addressed factors were further explored . Results : We  identified 30 studies that were included in the review ;  a diverse range of personal and environmental factors associated with self-care behaviours in heart  failure patients  were identified . Age , health-related quality of life , gender , education , New York Heart Association class , depressive symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction were most often correlated with the EHFScBS score . Consistent evidence for the relationship between  self-care behaviours and depression  was found , while their association with New York Heart Association class and  health-related quality of life  was non-significant in most of the studies . Associations with other factors were shown to be inconsistent or need to be further investigated as they were only addressed in single studies . Conclusion : A sufficient body of evidence is available only for a few factors related to heart failure self-care measured by the EHFScBS and indicates their limited impact on patient heart failure self-care . The study highlights the need for further exploration of relationships that would offer a more comprehensive underst and ing of associating factors."
"wBACKGROUND The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate the use of an  online service  for conducting a systematic review and meta- analysis of the efficacy of  topical prostagl and in analogs  in reducing   intraocular pressure  ( IOP ) in glaucoma and ocular hypertension .  METHODS An online service provider ( Doctor Evidence ) review ed and extracted data from the peer- review ed literature through September 2009 . R and  omized  controlled studies of at least three months ' duration assessing  at least two  prostagl  and in analogs   in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma , ocular hypertension , or normal-tension glaucoma  were included . The primary endpoint was  mean IOP .  Summary estimates were created using r and om-effects models . The Q Chi-square test was used to assess statistical heterogeneity . RESULTS  Sixteen studies satisfied the inclusion criteria  and  were analyzed  . On average , greater  IOP-lowering  was seen with  bimatoprost  relative to  latanoprost  ( 1 mmHg , P = 0.025 ) and  travoprost  ( 0.8 mmHg , P = 0.033 ) based on  mean IOP  after 12 - 26 weeks of treatment . No statistical difference was observed in  IOP-lowering  between latanoprost and travoprost ( P = 0.841 ) . Findings were similar to previously published meta-analyses of topical prostagl and in analogs .  Systematic review s relying on meta-analytic techniques to create summary statistics are considered to be the "" gold st and ard "" for synthesizing evidence to support clinical decision-making . However , the process is time-consuming , labor-intensive , and outside the capability of most formulary managers . We have demonstrated the effectiveness of a commercial service that facilitates the process of conducting such review."

"sOBJECTIVE The primary aim of the current study was to synthesize evidence of the effect of  social media use  compared with  no social media use  as part of interventions to reduce risk factors for  noncommunicable diseases  . DATA SOURCES Data bases were search ed up to  June 10 , 2014  , using medical subject headings . A secondary aim of this study was to assess the  effectiveness  of  social media use  compared with  no social media use  in reducing the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases , stratifying the results by the extent of bias on outcomes , by social media use alone , and by the levels of social presence and media richness . STUDY SELECTION  Sixteen trials ( n=10,711 participants ) met the inclusion criteria  , but interventions mostly used social media with low levels of media richness and presence ( e.g. , discussion boards , bulletin boards ) . DATA SYNTHESIS Meta- analysis of all trials showed no significant differences ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] -0.14 ; 95%CI -0.28 to 0.01 ) , with similar findings for  physical activity  ( SMD 0.07 ; 95%CI -0.25 to 0.38 ) ,  body weight  ( SMD 0.07 ; 95%CI -0.17 to 0.20 ) , and  fruit and vegetable intake  ( SMD 0.39 ; 95%CI -0.11 to 0.89 ) . Trials assessing  social media interventions  aim ed at modifying risk factors for noncommunicable diseases showed that   social  media use  improved the primary outcomes , but the overall quality of the included studies limits the generalizability of these findings .  Further trials are warranted , especially to isolate the effect of social media use and to fully evaluate the effect of the social presence and media richness of social media platforms."

The literature search was performed on Pubmed , EMBASE , the Web of Science , SCOPUS , CINAHL , Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library using the terms ' lung cancer ' OR NSCLC AND ' fourth line ' . The response rates and disease  control  rates were pooled using a r and om-effect or a fixed-effect model according to heterogeneity .  Median progression-free survival and overall survival  data were also collected and aggregated to obtain pooled median values of the included studies . Overall ,  14 studies ( 673 patients ) , which were almost entirely published by Asian institutions ,  were eligible for this pooled analysis . Among these were two phase II trials and 12 retrospective cohort series . In general , the  pooled overall response rate  was 13.6 % [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 10 - 18.3 ] and the pooled  overall disease control rate  was 47.3 % ( 95 % CI 38 - 56.9 ) . The  pooled median progression-free survival  for these studies was 3.34 months ( 95 % CI 2.42 - 4.27 ) . The  pooled median overall survival  for these studies was 10.5 months ( 95 % CI 9.57 - 11.52 ) . In conclusion , for  non-small-cell lung cancer patients who have undergone three or more unsuccessful lines of therapy  ,  fourth-line  treatment could be offered in select cases to those with a good performance status."
"sAbstract Background / aims  Contingency management ( CM ) interventions  have gained considerable interest due to their success in the treatment of addiction . However , their implementation can be re source ‐intensive for clinical staff .  Mobile telephone‐based  systems might offer a low‐cost alternative . This approach could facilitate remote monitoring of behaviour and delivery of the reinforcer and minimize issues of staffing and re sources . This systematic review and meta‐ analysis assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of  mobile telephone‐delivered CM interventions  to promote abstinence ( from drugs , alcohol and tobacco ) , medication adherence and treatment engagement among  individuals with substance use disorders .  Design A systematic search of data bases ( PsychINFO , CINAHL , MEDLINE PubMed , CENTRAL , Embase ) for r and omized controlled trials and within‐subject design studies ( 1995–2019 ) . The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement . The protocol was registered on PROSPERO . Setting All included  studies originated in the United states .  Participants  Seven studies were found , including 222 participants ; two targeted alcohol abstinence among frequent drinkers and four targeted  smoking cessation  ( in homeless veterans and those with post‐traumatic stress disorder )  . One targeted medication adherence . Measures The  efficacy  of   CM   to  increase alcohol and nicotine abstinence  was compared with control using several outcomes  ; percentage of negative sample s ( PNS ) , quit rate ( QR ) and longest duration abstinent ( LDA )  at the end of the intervention . Findings The r and om‐effects meta‐analyses produced  pooled  effect sizes of ; PNS [ d = 0.94 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.63–1.25 ] , LDA ( d = 1.08 , 95 % CI = 0.69–1.46 ) and QR ( d = 0.46 , 95 % CI = 0.27–0.66 ) , demonstrating better outcomes  across the CM conditions  . Most of the studies were rated as of moderate quality . ‘ Fail‐safe N ' computations for PNS indicated that 50 studies would be needed to produce a non‐significant overall effect size . None could be calculated for QR and LDA due to insufficient number of studies .  Conclusion Mobile telephone‐delivered contingency management   performs significantly better   than control conditions   in reducing tobacco and alcohol use  among adults not in treatment for substance use disorders."
"nBackground  Older adults living with dementia  may have a higher risk of  medication toxicity  than those without dementia . Optimising prescribing in this group of people is a critically important yet challenging process . Objective Our aim was to systematic ally review the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for optimising prescribing in  older people with dementia .  Methods This systematic review search ed the Pubmed , Embase , CINAHL , PsycINFO and Cochrane Library electronic data bases for studies that evaluated relevant interventions . Experimental , quasi-experimental and observational studies  published in English prior to August 2018  were included . Data were synthesis ed at a narrative level . Results  The 18 studies accepted for review included seven r and omised , two nonr and omised controlled , five quasi-experimental and four observational studies .  Half the studies were conducted in  nursing homes  and the other half in  hospital and community  setting s. There was great variability in the interventions and outcomes reported and a meta- analysis was not feasible . The three r and omised and four nonr and omised studies examining medication appropriateness all reported improvements on at least one measure of the outcome . Six studies reported on interventions that identified  and resolved drug-related problems .  The results for other outcomes , including the  number of medications  ( 10 studies ) ,  healthcare utilisation  ( 7 studies ) ,  mortality  ( 7 studies ) ,  quality of life  ( 3 studies ) and  falls  ( 3 studies ) , were mixed and difficult to synthesis e because of variability in the study design and measures used . Conclusion Emerging evidence suggests that interventions in  older people with dementia  may have positive effects on medication appropriateness and resolution of drug-related problems ; however , whether optimisation of medication results in clinical ly meaningful outcomes remains uncertain."
"yOBJECTIVE  People with cancer  can  experience  psychological distress   but do not always desire , or engage with , professional support to assist with managing distress .  Interventions that are self-directed or guided by patients  may hold promise as they allow patients to engage with interventions as they need . The objective of this review is to describe and appraise the evidence for effectiveness of  self-guided interventions  that aim to manage  psychological distress  in  people with cancer .  METHODS A systematic search of Medline  ,  PsychInfo  and CINAHL  identified  15 relevant papers , reporting on 14 studies .  RESULTS Of the interventions , three studies comprised hard-copy workbooks , six studies used re source packs , four were online re sources and one was a brief multimedia re source . One study was adequately powered and demonstrated a  positive effect .  Almost all interventions required some  level of facilitation . Distressed  participants may benefit more from interventions .   Self-guided interventions  represent a potentially efficient way of delivering support for people affected by cancer , however evidence supporting them is lacking . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S There is a need to generate evidence to underst and the impact of  self-guided interventions  for : i ) the ideal delivery point in the disease trajectory , ii ) patient groups , iii ) intervention content and iv ) type and mode of delivery."
" Although research in continuous monitoring and feedback of clinical outcomes shows promising results in counselling setting s , study quality , and method ological issues set limitations on the generalizability of the findings . PRACTITIONER POINTS Feedback improves the  outcome of therapy  for  young people with mild problems  for those who are at risk of not improving with therapy . Feedback improves  outcomes  for those with more severe mental health problems but with reduced effect sizes . We do not know if improved outcomes are sustained . The generalizability of the findings may be limited."
"rAIMS To present a method ological exemplar of integrating findings from a quantitative and qualitative review on the same topic to provide insight into components of care that contribute to supportive care that is acceptable to  men with prostate cancer .  BACKGROUND  Men with prostate cancer  are likely to live a long time with the disease , experience side effects from treatment and therefore have ongoing supportive care needs . Quantitative and qualitative review s have been published but the findings have yet to be integrated . DESIGN Integration of  quantitative and qualitative synthesized evidence .  DATA SOURCE Two previously published systematic review s. REVIEW METHODS Synthesized evidence on supportive care for  men with prostate cancer  was integrated from two previously published systematic review s : a narrative quantitative review and a qualitative  review  with thematic synthesis . These two streams of synthesized evidence were synthesized using concurrent narrative summary . Data from both review s were used to develop a set of propositions from which a summary of components of care that likely to contribute to supportive care acceptable to men with prostate cancer were identified . RESULTS Nine propositions were developed which covered  men 's  supportive care focusing on the role of health professionals . These propositions were used to compose nine components of care likely to lead to supportive  care  that is acceptable to  men  with  prostate  cancer . Some of these components are no/low cost such as developing a more empathic personalized approach , but more specific approaches need further investigation in r and omized controlled trials , for example , online support .  This method ological exemplar demonstrates the integration of quantitative and qualitative synthesized data to determine components of care likely to lead to provision of supportive care acceptable to men with prostate cancer."

"dBACKGROUND Medical Research Council ( MRC ) guidelines recommend applying theory within complex interventions to explain how behaviour change occurs . Guidelines endorse  self-management  of  chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) and osteoarthritis  (  OA  ) , but evidence for its effectiveness is weak . OBJECTIVE This literature review aim ed to determine the use of  behaviour change theory and techniques  within r and omised controlled trials of  group-based  self-management  programmes for chronic musculoskeletal pain , specifically CLBP and OA .  METHODS A two-phase search strategy of electronic data bases was used to identify systematic review s and studies relevant to this area . Articles were coded for their use of behaviour change theory , and the number of   behaviour change  techniques ( BCTs )  was identified using a 93-item taxonomy , Taxonomy ( v1 ) . RESULTS  25 articles of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria  , of which only three reported having based their intervention on  theory  , and all used  Social Cognitive Theory .  A total of 33 BCTs were coded across all articles with the most commonly identified techniques being  ' instruction on how to perform the behaviour '  , '  demonstration of the behaviour '  , '  behavioural practice '  , '  credible source '  ,  ' grade d tasks '  and '  body changes ' .   Results demonstrate that theoretically driven research within  group  based self-management programmes for chronic musculoskeletal pain is lacking , or is poorly reported . Future research that follows recommended guidelines regarding the use of theory in study design and reporting is warranted."

"sBackground Almost half of  mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) patients  progress to dementia , which is associated with decreased quality of life and obstacles to independent living . Relevant management is expected to prevent  MCI patients  from progressing to dementia . In recent years ,  electroacupuncture ( EA )  has been used to treat various kinds of neurological disorders including MCI . This study evaluates the use of  EA  for  MCI patients  to increase  cognitive function  through a comparison with Western medications . Methods R and omized controlled trials ( RCT ) or systematic al review s ( SR ) of  EA versus Western medications for MCI  were search ed using the following 10  data bases  : Pubmed , Cochrane Library , CINAHL , EMBASE , China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) , National Digital Science Library ( NDSL ) , Journal of Oriental Neuropsychiatry ( JON )  , Korean Medical Data base ( KMBASE ) , KoreaMed , and OASIS , from October 2007 to August 2017  , without  language  restriction . A method ological quality assessment of RCTs or SRs that met inclusion criteria was conducted using Cochrane Risk of bias ( RoB ) tool and a meta- analysis by RevMan ( Review Manager ) 5.3.5 version of Cochrane collaboration . Results  Five RCTs with 257 patients met inclusion criteria  and those were r and omly divided into two groups :  the EA  group ( n = 103 ) and  Western medications  group ( n = 154 ) . The method ological quality of the included studies showed high risk or/ and unclear of risk of bias . The meta- analysis of five studies reported that  the EA  group was better than  the Western medications  group ,  improving the Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score  by 0.65 [ 95 % CI 0.28~1.01 ] higher mean  difference , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) score  by 0.66 [ 95 % CI 0.00~1.32 ] higher mean  difference . Adverse effects  were not reported in the selected studies . Conclusion Electroacupuncture was an effective treatment for  MCI patients  by  improving cognitive function  . However , the included studies presented a low method ological quality and no adverse effects were reported . Thus , further comprehensive studies with a design in depth are needed to derive significant results."
"LPreterm  birth ( infants born at < 37 wk of gestational age )  is a significant clinical and public health challenge in the United States and globally . No universally accepted practice guidelines exist for the nutritional care of  preterm infants .  To address the current state of knowledge and to support systematic review s that will be used to develop evidence -informed guidance , a consortium consisting of the American Academy of Pediatrics , the ASN , the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition , the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , the Food and Drug Administration , the CDC , the USDA/Agricultural Research Service ( USDA/ARS ) , and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/NIH initiated the Pre-B Project . The project included the constitution of 4 thematic working groups charged with the following tasks : 1 ) develop a series of topics/ questions for which there is sufficient evidence to support a  systematic review process  to be conducted by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics ' Evidence Analysis Library ( EAL ) , leading to the development of new guidelines for nutritional care of preterm infants , and 2 ) develop a targeted research agenda to address priority gaps in our underst and ing of the role of nutrition in the health and development of preterm/neonatal  intensive care unit infants  . This review consists of a project overview including a summary of a workshop hosted by the USDA/ARS Children 's Nutrition Research Center and summary reports of the 4 working groups established to address the following themes :  1 ) nutrient specifications , 2 ) clinical /practical issues in enteral feeding , 3 ) gastrointestinal and surgical issues , and 4 ) current st and ards for assessing infant feeding outcomes .  These reports will serve as the basis for the ultimate guideline development process to be conducted by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics ' EAL."
" No conclusions regarding  breast cancer-related and all-cause mortality or breast cancer recurrence  were possible . However ,  physical activity interventions  may have small-to-moderate  beneficial effects on HRQoL , and on emotional or perceived physical and social function , anxiety , cardiorespiratory fitness , and self-reported and objective ly measured physical activity .  The positive results reported in the current review must be interpreted cautiously owing to very low-to-moderate quality of evidence , heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures , imprecision of some estimates , and risk of bias in many trials . Future studies with low risk of bias are required to determine the optimal combination of  physical activity  modes , frequencies , intensities , and duration s needed to improve specific outcomes among women who have undergone adjuvant therapy."
" Evidence of low to moderate quality shows that  beta2-agonists , both SABA and LABA  , when administered in a single dose , are  effective and safe  in preventing EIA.Long-term regular administration of inhaled  beta2-agonists  induces  tolerance  and lacks sufficient  safety  data . This finding appears to be of particular clinical relevance in view of the potential for prolonged regular use of  beta2-agonists  as monotherapy in the pretreatment of EIA , despite the warnings of drug agencies ( FDA , EMA ) regarding LABA."

This study aim ed to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis of the relationships between prenatal  exercise  and GDM , GH and PE . Design Systematic review with r and om effects meta- analysis and meta-regression . Data sources Online data bases were search ed up to 6 January 2017 . Study eligibility criteria  Studies of all design s were included ( except case studies ) if published in English , Spanish or French , and contained information on the Population ( pregnant women without contraindication to  exercise  ) , Intervention ( subjective or objective measures of  frequency  ,  intensity  ,  duration  ,  volume  or  type of exercise   ,   alone [ “ exercise-only ” ]  or  in combination with other intervention components [   e.g. ,   dietary ;  “  exercise  + co-intervention ” ]  ) , Comparator  ( no exercise or different frequency , intensity , duration , volume and type of exercise )  and Outcomes ( GDM , GH , PE ) . Results  A total of 106 studies ( n=273 182 ) were included .  ‘ Moderate ’ to ‘ high’- quality evidence from r and omised controlled trials revealed that  exercise-only interventions  , but not  exercise+co interventions  , reduced odds of  GDM  ( n=6934 ; OR 0.62 , 95 % CI 0.52 to 0.75 ) ,  GH  ( n=5316 ; OR 0.61 , 95 % CI 0.43 to 0.85 ) and  PE  ( n=3322 ; OR 0.59 , 95 % CI 0.37 to 0.9 ) compared with  no exercise .  To achieve at least a 25 % reduction in the odds of  developing GDM , PE and GH  ,  pregnant women  need to accumulate at least 600 MET-min/week of moderate-intensity exercise ( eg , 140 min of brisk walking , water aerobics , stationary cycling or resistance training ) . Summary / conclusions In conclusion ,  exercise-only interventions  were effective at lowering the odds of developing GDM , GH and PE."
"sWe review ed intervention studies design  ed to increase   human papillomavirus  (  HPV  ) vaccination coverage   to further underst and the impact interventions can have on  HPV vaccination coverage .  We search  ed 5 data bases  for intervention studies published  from June 2006 to May 2015 .  Studies were included if they quantitatively measured  HPV vaccination coverage  as an outcome and  were conducted in the United States .  We abstract ed outcomes , methods , and results from each study and classified by type of intervention conducted . Findings from 34 studies suggest many types of intervention strategies can increase  HPV vaccination coverage  in different setting s , and with modest cost . Interventions were effective especially when implemented in combination at both provider and community levels . However , not all interventions showed significant effects on  coverage .  More research is needed to identify the best methods for widespread implementation of effective strategies."
"eINTRODUCTION  Acute respiratory failure ( ARF )  is a common problem encountered by emergency medical services and is associated with significant morbidity , mortality , and health care costs .  Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP )  is an integral part of the hospital treatment of acute ARF , predominantly because of congestive heart failure . Intuitively , better patient outcomes may be achieved when  CPAP  is applied early in the prehospital setting , but there are few outcome studies to vali date its use in this setting . OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to examine the  effectiveness  of  CPAP  in the prehospital setting for  patients with ARF .  METHODS A literature review of bibliographic data bases and secondary sources was conducted and potential papers were assessed by two independent review ers . Included studies were those that compared   CPAP therapy (  and  usual  care )  with  no CPAP  for ARF in the prehospital setting . Studies of other methods of noninvasive ventilation were not included . Method ologic quality was assessed using guidelines from the Cochrane Collaboration . Outcomes included the  number of intubations , mortality , physiologic parameters , and dyspnea score . Forrest  plots were constructed to estimate the pooled effect of  CPAP  on outcomes . RESULTS  Five studies ( 1,002 patients ) met the selection criteria --three r  and  omized  controlled trials ( RCTs ) , a nonr and omized comparative study , and a retrospective comparative study using chart review .  Forty-seven percent of the patients were allocated  to the   CPAP  group  . Baseline characteristics were similar between groups . The pooled estimates demonstrated significantly  fewer intubations  ( odds ratio [ OR ] 0.31 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.19 - 0.51 ) and  lower mortality  ( OR 0.41 ; 95 % CI 0.19 - 0.87 ) in the  CPAP  group .  The studies included in this review showed a reduction in the  number of intubations and mortality  in  patients with ARF who received  CPAP  in the prehospital setting .  The results may not be applicable to other health care context s because of the inherent differences in the organization and staffing of the EMS systems . Information from large RCTs on the efficacy of  CPAP  initiated early in the prehospital setting is critical to establishing the evidence base underpinning this therapy before ambulance services incorporate  CPAP  as routine clinical practice."
"eAbstract  Physical exercise  seems to be a safe  and effective  intervention in  patients with inflammatory myopathy ( IM ) .  However , the optimal training intervention is not clear . To achieve an optimum training effect ,  physical exercise training principles  must be considered and to replicate research findings , FITT components ( frequency , intensity , time , and type ) of  exercise training  should be reported . This review aims to evaluate  exercise interventions  in  studies with IM patients  in relation to ( 1 ) the application of principles of  exercise training  , ( 2 ) the reporting of FITT components , ( 3 ) the adherence of participants to the intervention , and ( 4 ) to assess the method ological quality of the included studies . The literature was search ed for  exercise studies  in  IM patients .  Data were extracted to evaluate the application of the training principles , the reporting of and the adherence to the exercise prescription . The Downs and Black checklist was used to assess method ological quality of the included studies . From the 14 included studies , four focused on resistance , two on endurance , and eight on combined training . In terms of principles of exercise training , 93 % reported  specificity  , 50 %  progression and overload  , and 79 %  initial values . Reversibility and diminishing returns  were never reported . Six articles reported all  FITT components  in the prescription of the training though no study described  adherence  to all of these components . Incomplete application of the  exercise training  principles and insufficient reporting of the  exercise intervention  prescribed and completed hamper the reproducibility of the intervention and the ability to determine the optimal dose of exercise."
"CIn clinical trials of  systemic therapy  for advanced  hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC )  ,  Asian trials  almost always reported poorer survival than non-Asian trials . This study sought to identify contributory factors for this geographic difference . A systematic review was done on r and omized trials for  unresectable HCC  that used  systemic therapy  as an  experimental arm  and  placebo or supportive care as control .  Meta- analysis was performed with the consideration of fixed and r and om effects . Then , meta-regression was performed to identify predictors of  patient survival  in the control arm and the treatment effects ( improvement in  median survival  ) .  Fourteen trials ( 6 Asians , 8 non-Asians ) were eligible for meta- analysis .  The  median survival  of patients in the control arm , which indicated natural history of advanced HCC patients , was 3.57+/-1.88 months in Asian trials and 5.96+/-1.46 months in non-Asian trials ( p=0.02 ) . Independent predictors of better  survival  included non-Asian trials ( p=0.0007 ) , higher percentage of Child A cirrhosis ( p=0.01 ) and hepatitis B (HBV)-related HCC ( p=0.02 ) . Sub-group analysis suggested that Asian trials tended to enroll patients with more advanced diseases . Independent predictors of better  treatment effect  included non-Asian trials , higher percentage of  extra-hepatic metastasis  ,  HBV-related HCC  , and  poorer trial quality .  The quantitative estimation of the geographic difference can help design of future clinical trials of advanced HCC."
"yObjectives There has been little evaluation of the evidence relating dietary factors to  functional capacity  in  older adults .  The aims were to i ) conduct a systematic review of studies assessing dietary factors in relation to six key functional indicators which impact on  quality of life  in  adults ≥65 yrs :  non-fatal cardiovascular events , cognition , mental health , falls and fractures , physical health (  muscle mass , strength ) and frailty  ; and ii ) assess if there was sufficient evidence to devise food-based dietary recommendations . Design Systematic review . Participants  Cross-sectional and prospect i ve cohort studies  were included together with intervention studies that evaluated  food/drink interventions ( excluding supplements )  . Evidence base statements were determined according to the GRADE ( Grade s of Recommendation , Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) levels of evidence criteria ( Grade s ( A-excellent ; B-good ; C-satisfactory ; D-poor ) . Results There was good evidence that  the Mediterranean type diet (  MD )  reduced the risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events  ( Grade B )  and reduced cognitive decline  ( Grade B ) . There was some evidence indicating that  a  MD  decreases the likelihood of frailty  ( Grade C ) , consistent but weaker evidence that ≥3 servings/d of vegetables is associated  with reduced cognitive decline  ( Grade D ) , a modest increase in protein may be associated  with improved cognition  ( Grade C ) and  decreased frailty  ( Grade C ) , and that  protein plus resistance exercise training  in frail elderly may  enhance physical strength  ( Grade C ) . Conclusion It is recommended that  older adults  adopt the characteristics of a Mediterranean type diet such as including olive oil and eating ≥3 servings/d of vegetables to reduce  their risk of chronic disease , impaired cognition and frailty .  Consumption of dietary protein above the current dietary requirements would be recommended to reduce  risk of frailty and impaired cognition  . A modest increase in dietary protein when combined with resistance exercise would be recommended to help  maintain muscle mass and strength  and to enhance functional capacity."
 This study provides some evidence that  tailored counseling  alone or  with tailored supervised exercise   improves long-term PA participation and functional exercise capacity  after stroke better than does tailored supervised exercise with general advice only . Interventions to  improve participation in PA  should  incorporate PA-specific tailored counseling  based on sound behavioral theory to promote  long-term participation in PA .

"yThe aim of this systematic review is to assess the  effectiveness  of  acupuncture  as an adjunctive  analgesic  method  to st and ard anaesthetic procedures for surgery  and to determine whether  acupuncture  has any  analgesic-sparing effect .  Electronic literature search es for r and omised clinical trials ( RCTs ) of   acupuncture  during surgery  were performed in seven electronic data bases . No language restrictions were imposed . All included studies were rated according to their method ological quality and validity . As the studies were clinical ly heterogeneous , no meta-analyses were performed . The evidence was classified according to four levels : strong , moderate , limited , or inconclusive .  Nineteen RCTs were identified .  Seven of them suggested that  acupuncture  is efficacious . Of nine high- quality RCTs , two studies had  positive outcomes .  There was no significant association between  study quality and direction of outcome .  One of eight high-validity trials reported a  positive outcome  and there was a significant  relationship  between  validity and direction of outcome .  The evidence that  acupuncture  is more effective than no  acupuncture  as an adjunct to st and ard anaesthetic procedures is therefore inconclusive . Strong evidence exists that real  acupuncture  is not significantly different from  placebo acupuncture .  For an  analgesic-sparing effect  of  acupuncture  , evidence remains inconclusive . In conclusion , this review does not support the use of  acupuncture  as an adjunct to  st and ard anaesthetic procedures during  surgery."
"tThis paper summarizes the literature concerning the effects of administering ( 1 )  long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( LCPUFA ) , ( 2 ) probiotics and /or ( 3 ) prebiotics  to  preterm infants .  Clinical ly relevant , short- and long-term efficacy outcomes , such as those related to a reduced risk of disease , as well as outcomes related to safety , were sought . MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library literature search es performed in September 2010 were limited to r and omized controlled trials , their systematic review s or meta-analyses .  LCPUFA supplementation  , particularly  docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )  , of infant formula for  preterm infants  has consistently demonstrated better  visual development  of preterm  infants  compared with unsupplemented formulas . There is increasing evidence to suggest that LCPUFA supplementation for preterm infants is also related to improvements in more  global measures of development  , without any adverse  effects .  It is , however , important to note that the DHA doses tested in the infant formula interventions for  preterm infants  have been rather conservative . Newer studies comparing  dietary DHA  concentrations that match in utero accumulation rates with dietary DHA concentrations typical in the milk of women consuming little fish or in supplemented infant formulas demonstrate that these higher DHA doses are related to improvements in  domains of cognitive development .  Although further work is needed to better underst and the optimal DHA requirements of  preterm infants  , it is clear that a dietary source of DHA is important to support neurodevelopment . To date , the most promising application of probiotics in  preterm infants  is the  prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis  by the administration of certain probiotics . Many other benefits of administering  probiotics and  /or  prebiotics  to preterm  infants  are , however , largely unproven .  Efficacy and safety  should be established for each probiotic and /or prebiotic product . Further research should specify strain-specific outcomes and determine optimal dosing schedules . Safety and long-term follow-up studies are of particular interest."
" : In conclusion , findings of the present study indicate that a very high ( ≥1.2 g/kg/day ) and high protein intake ( ≥1.0 g/kg/day ) are associated with  better lower-limb physical performance  , when compared to low protein ( < 0.80 g/kg/day ) intake , in  community-dwelling older adults .  These findings act as additional evidence regarding the potential need to increase protein guidelines to above the current recommendations . However , large r and omized clinical trials are needed to confirm the addictive effects of high-protein diets ( ≥1.0 g/kg/day ) in comparison to the current recommendations on physical functioning . All data are available in the Open ScienceFramework."

"nABSTRACT Objective : To evaluate the effectiveness of  psychosocial interventions  on  depressive symptoms , anxiety symptoms , quality of life , self-efficacy , coping , carer strain and carer satisfaction  among  stroke survivors , carers and survivor-carer dyads .  Data sources : MEDLINE , CINAHL , PsycINFO , SocINDEX , Cochrane Library , Web of Science and Scopus data bases and the grey literature were search ed up to September 2018 . Methods : A systematic review and meta- analysis of  r and omized controlled trials  of   psychosocial interventions  for stroke survivors , carers and survivor-carer dyads  ,   compared  to usual care .  Outcomes measured were  depressive symptoms , anxiety symptoms , quality of life , coping , self-efficacy , carer strain , and carer satisfaction .  Results :  Thirty-one r and omized controlled trials ( n = 5715 ) were included  in the systematic review which found improvements  in depressive symptoms , anxiety symptoms , quality of life and coping  , though the number of trials assessing each outcome varied . A meta- analysis ( 11 trials  ; n = 1280 )  on  depressive symptoms  found that in seven  trials psychosocial interventions   reduced depressive symptoms  in stroke survivors ( SMD : −0.36 , 95 % CI −0.73 to 0.00 ; p = .05 ) and in six trials  reduced depressive symptoms  in carers ( SMD : −0.20 , 95 % CI −.40 to 0.00 ; p = .05 ) .  Conclusion : Psychosocial interventions   reduced depressive symptoms  in  stroke survivors  and their carers . There was limited evidence that such interventions  reduced anxiety symptoms  , or  improved quality of life and coping  for stroke survivors and carers and no evidence that they improved self-efficacy , carer strain or carer satisfaction."
"ePURPOSE We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to quantify the  pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate  after  preoperative (chemo)radiation with doses of ⩾60Gy  in  patients with locally advanced rectal cancer .  Complete response is relevant since this could select a proportion of patients for which organ-preserving strategies might be possible . Furthermore , we investigated correlations between EQD2 dose and  pCR-rate ,  toxicity or resectability , and additionally between pCR-rate and chemotherapy , boost-approach or surgical-interval . METHODS AND MATERIAL S PubMed , EMBASE and Cochrane libraries were search ed with the terms '  radiotherapy '  ,  ' boost '  and  '  rectal cancer ' and synonym terms .  Studies delivering  a  preoperative dose of  ⩾60 Gy were eligible for inclusion . Original English full texts that allowed intention-to-treat pCR-rate calculation were included . Study variables ,  including pCR , acute grade ⩾3 toxicity and resectability-rate  , were extracted by two authors independently . Eligibility for meta- analysis was assessed by critical appraisal . Heterogeneity and pooled estimates were calculated for all three outcomes . Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the variables mentioned earlier . RESULTS The search identified  3377 original articles , of which 18 met our inclusion criteria ( 1106 patients ) . Fourteen studies were included  for  meta- analysis ( 487 patients treated with ⩾60  Gy  ) . pCR-rate  ranged between 0.0 %  and 44.4 % .  Toxicity ranged between 1.3 % and 43.8 % and resectability-rate between 34.0 % and 100 %  . Pooled pCR-rate  was 20.4 % ( 95 % CI 16.8 - 24.5 % ) , with low heterogeneity ( I2 0.0 % , 95 % CI 0.00  - 84.0 % ) . Pooled acute grade ⩾3  toxicity was 10.3 % ( 95 % CI 5.4 - 18.6 % ) and pooled resectability-rate was 89.5 % ( 95 % CI 78.2 - 95.3 % ) .  Dose escalation above 60 Gy for  locally advanced rectal cancer  results in  high pCR-rates  and  acceptable early  toxicity . This observation needs to be further investigated within larger r and omized controlled phase 3 trials in the future."

 Whether clinicians decide to utilise repeat intramuscular doses of  vitamin A  to prevent  chronic lung disease  may depend upon the local incidence of this outcome and the value attached to achieving a modest reduction in the outcome balanced against the lack of other proven benefits and the acceptability of the treatment . Information on long-term neurodevelopmental status suggests no evidence of either benefit or harm from the intervention.
"kBACKGROUND  Premature infants  are at increased risk for  metabolic bone disease  , with result ing delayed  bone growth , osteopenia  , and  rickets .  METHOD A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding  neonatal patients at risk of metabolic bone disease receiving  parenteral or enteral nutrition   was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development and Evaluation working group . A consensus process was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to external and internal review and approval by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Board of Directors . QUESTIONS ( 1 ) What maternal risk factors predispose the neonate to  metabolic bone disease  ? ( 2 ) What is the optimal type of feeding to promote  neonatal bone health  ? ( 3 ) When and how should  vitamin D supplements  be administered ? ( 4 ) Does  parenteral nutrition ( PN )  predispose a neonate to  metabolic bone disease  , and if so , are there  PN formulation  recommendations to minimize this risk."

"dDietary  counselling and oral nutritional supplements ( ONS )  are recommended for managing malnutrition . A recent systematic review demonstrated ( in separate analyses ) that  dietary counselling and dietary counselling with ONS  improved  energy intake , weight and some indices of body composition  , although there was considerable heterogeneity . The present analysis aim ed to examine the effects on  mortality and nutritional indices  of  dietary counselling given with or without ONS  and to explore the heterogeneity in the meta-analyses aim ing to characterise the groups most likely to benefit from these interventions . A systematic review and meta- analysis was performed using Cochrane methodology .  Twenty-six studies were included in the analysis : 12 comparing  dietary counselling with usual care  and 14 comparing  dietary counselling and ONS if required with usual care  ( 2123 participants ) .  Quality of studies varied .  Dietary counselling given with or without ONS  had no effect on  mortality  [ relative risk ( fixed ) = 1.12 ; 95 % confidence interval = 0.86 - 1.46 ] but was associated with significant but  heterogeneous benefits to weight  [ mean difference ( r and om ) = 1.7 kg ; 95 % confidence interval = 0.86 - 2.55 ]  , energy intake  and  some aspects of body composition .  Subgroup analyses taking into account clinical background , age , nutritional status , type and length of intervention failed to reveal any differences in  mortality , weight change and energy intake  between groups . There were insufficient data on functional outcomes to explore these findings .  Dietary counselling given with or without ONS  is effective at increasing  nutritional intake and weight  but adequately-powered studies in similar  patient population  s and st and ardised for factors that might account for variations in response are required."

" Despite prolific effectiveness and efficacy research on  eHealth interventions  for  caregivers of people with dementia  , there is a critical dearth of implementation research . Furthermore , there is a mismatch between eHealth intervention research and implementation frameworks , especially concerning organizational factors and wider context .

"WPregnant  women  are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from influenza and are recognized as a priority group for influenza vaccination . Despite this , uptake is often poor and one reason cited for this is concerns about safety . The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the safety of  inactivated influenza vaccination ( IIV )  in pregnancy . Studies were included if they were : ( i )  observational or experimental design  ; ( ii ) included  a comparator group comprising of unvaccinated pregnant women ;  ( iii ) comprised of either  seasonal IIV or monovalent H1N1 IIV  (  including adjuvanted vaccines ) ;  and ( iv ) addressed one of the following outcomes :  preterm birth ( PTB ) , small for gestational age ( SGA ) , fetal death ( including stillbirth or spontaneous abortion ) , low birth weight ( LBW ) or congenital abnormalities .  Two review ers screened abstract s and titles and selected full texts for retrieval .  Crude odds ratios  were calculated from reported event rates , using binomial st and ard errors .  Adjusted odds ratios , hazard ratios and relative rates  were extracted as reported in each paper . After removal of duplicates and full text eligibility assessment ,  40 studies remained .  The aOR for PTB was 0.87 ( 0.78 - 0.96 ) , for  LBW  0.82 ( 0.76 - 0.89 ) ,  congenital abnormality  1.03 ( 0.99 - 1.07 ) ,  SGA  0.99 ( 0.94 - 1.04 ) and  stillbirth  0.84 ( 0.65 - 1.08 ) . This study contributes to the increasing body of safety data for  IIV  in pregnancy and reports a protective effect on  PTB  and LBW."
"dCurrent U.S. dietary guidelines recommend several healthy eating patterns , including U.S. , Mediterranean , and vegetarian diets ( 1 ) . Although the guidelines recognize the occasional need for nutritional supplementation or food fortification for specific nutrients that may be consumed in inadequate amounts , they do not recommend routine use of any  dietary  supplement to reduce risk for cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) or other chronic diseases . Despite these recommendations , most  U.S. adults  use  supplements  to enhance their diets , with uncertain health benefits ( 2 , 3 ) . From 1999 to 2012 , the NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ) reported that 52 % of  participants  used at least 1 and 10 % used at least 4  dietary supplements  ( 4 ) . From 2011 to 2014 , the NHANES reported that  among participants aged 60 years or older  , 70 % used at least 1 and 29 % used at least 4 supplements , and 41 % of supplement takers reported that they did so to improve their overall health ( 5 ) . In 2013 , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force conducted a systematic review of the utility of  vitamin and mineral supplements  for CVD prevention and found little evidence to support use ( 6 ) . More recently , Jenkins and colleagues published a meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of  dietary supplements  published through October 2017 ( 7 ) . They found some  stroke benefit  conferred by folate  ; no CVD benefit  for multivitamins ,  vitamin  C ,  vitamin  D , or calcium ; and evidence for  mortality harm  for niacin and antioxidants . Since then , several l and mark RCTs evaluating the efficacy of  fish oils  ( 810 ) and  vitamin D  ( 11 , 12 ) for CVD prevention have been published , which add to the evidence level . In addition , the quality of the evidence base of these various  nutritional supplements and dietary interventions  still needs to be evaluated to ascertain the confidence in their efficacy . Thus , we performed a systematic review of existing meta-analyses of RCTs and generated an evidence map for efficacy of  nutritional supplements  and  dietary interventions  for CVD prevention . Methods Search Strategy We used PubMed , CINAHL , and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2019 to find meta-analyses published in the English language about vitamins , minerals , dietary supplements or products , and dietary interventions using the following search terms : ( * minerals OR * vitamins OR * diet AND * cardiovascular outcomes ) and ( meta-analy * OR metaanaly * OR systematic review * ) . After selecting systematic review s on the basis of a priori criteria , the search timelines of the systematic review s were review ed for recency and an up date d search for RCTs published in English was performed starting from the end date of search es from selected systematic review s until March 2019 ( Supplement Table 1 ) . Additional sources included Web sites of major cardiovascular and medicine journals ( www.onlinejacc.org ; https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj ; www.ahajournals.org/journal/circ ; www.nejm.org ; https://jamanetwork.com ; and http://annals.org/ aim ) and bibliographies of relevant studies . We also search ed Clinical Trials.gov ( 10 March 2019 ) to check for publication bias and to identify any new or ongoing trials ( Supplement Table 2 ) . Supplement . Supplemental Material . Study Selection The prespecified inclusion criteria were meta-analyses of RCTs assessing  efficacy  of   nutritional supplements ( vitamins , minerals , dietary supplements ) or dietary interventions  in adult participants ( 18 years ) that report effect estimates for  all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes  of interest and were written in English .  Because the nutritional and dietary recommendations are universal , there were no restrictions on baseline health status , race , or sex of the participants . Meta-analyses of observational studies or those reporting efficacy of interventions on surrogate or  other  outcomes , such as  blood pressure , lipid values , inflammatory markers , electrolytes , renal values , or quality -of-life indicators  , were excluded . Systematic review s reporting meta-analyses of both clinical trials and observational studies were review ed for data related to RCTs only . In case of multiple meta-analyses of the same intervention and outcome , we preferred the most recent , largest , and up date d meta- analysis . However , the competing meta-analyses were screened for any additional trials not included in the selected meta- analysis . After removing duplicates and following the selection criteria , we screened the retrieved articles at the title and abstract level and then at the methods level . The search , selection , and abstract ion processes were performed independently by 2 authors ( M.U.K. and S.V. ) . Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion and mutual consensus , referring to the original study or third-party review ( S.U.K. ) . Data Extraction , Outcomes , and Quality Assessment We first extracted information from eligible meta-analyses on first author , journal , year of publication , interventions , outcomes of interest , number of trials , whether an appropriate study search and selection criteria was reported , method of pooling estimates ( fixed or r and om effects ) , methods of detecting publication bias , measure of heterogeneity , and risk-of-bias assessment . Second , we generated the pool of clinical trials by identifying trials contained in the selected meta-analyses and screening competing meta-analyses for additional trials and trials published after the selected meta-analyses ( Supplement Table 3 ) . Among new clinical trials for   omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid  ( LC-PUFA ) ( 810 )  , we excluded  REDUCE-IT  ( Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA-Intervention Trial )   ( 9 ) because icosapent  ethyl  , a highly purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , does not qualify as a dietary supplement according to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ( 13 ) . Third , after removing duplicates , we abstract ed data on trial name , first author , year , intervention , outcomes , raw events , and sample sizes for each group . The main outcome of interest was  all-cause mortality .  The secondary outcomes were  cardiovascular mortality , myocardial infa rct ion ( MI ) , stroke , and coronary heart disease ( CHD ) .  Two independent review ers ( V.O. and M.S.K. ) assessed the method ological quality of meta-analyses on specific potential factors that may affect the validity of summary estimatesthat is , appropriate search and selection criteria , number of trials and participants included , risk-of-bias assessment of included trials , method of pooling the estimates , assessment of publication bias , and degree of heterogeneity ( Supplement Table 4 ) . Data Synthesis and Analysis We created an evidence map that displays the plausible benefits of each intervention and the certainty of the evidence ( 14 ) . The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE  (  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ) approach ( GRADE pro GDT ) ( https://gdt . grade pro.org/app/ ) ( 14 ) and was classified as high , moderate , low , or very low ( Supplement Table 5 ) . Two review ers ( V.O. and M.S.K. ) performed these assessment s under the supervision of a third review er ( S.U.K. ) . Estimates were pooled according to MantelHaenszel r and om-effects model . The PauleM and el method was used for reestimating outcomes . HartungKnapp small- sample adjustments were applied when the number of studies was less than 10 ( 15 ) .  Effect  sizes were reported as risk ratios ( RRs ) with 95 % CIs . We used I 2 statistics to estimate the extent of unexplained heterogeneity ; I 2 greater than 50 % was considered a high degree of between- study heterogeneity . We calculated the  Egger regression test  as an estimate of publication bias for any re analysis that included at least 10 studies ( 16 ) . Statistical analyses were conducted using meta , version 4.9 - 4 ( R Project for Statistical Computing ) . Statistical significance was set at 0.05 for all analyses except for the Egger regression test , which had a threshold less than 0.10 because of the test 's limited statistical power . Role of the Funding Source The study received no funding . Results Search Results Of  942 citations ,  after removing duplicates and screening at the title and abstract level we  review ed 140 full-text articles for eligibility .  We  excluded 131 articles  because they focused on  nonr and omized studies  , were not relevant , or were out date d , as well as 5 systematic review s that assessed  intake of nuts ( 17 ) , fruits and vegetables ( 18 ) , fiber (  19 ) ,  and green or black tea  ( 20 ) and those focusing on  low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets  ( 21 ) that did not report cardiovascular outcomes of interest . Ultimately , we included 9 systematic review s and 4  new  RCTs for a total  of 105 meta-analyses of 24 interventions ( 277 RCTs , 992129 participants ) ( 7 , 2229 )  (  Figure  1  )  . The interventions evaluated in the meta-analyses included 16  types of supplements ( antioxidants , -carotene , vitamin B complex , multivitamins , selenium , vitamin A , vitamin B3 or niacin , vitamin B6 , vitamin C , vitamin E , vitamin D , calcium plus vitamin D , calcium , folic acid , iron , and omega-3 LC-PUFA )  and 8  types of dietary interventions ( Mediterranean diet and intake of reduced saturated fat , modified dietary fat , reduced dietary fat  , reduced salt among hypertensive and normotensive participations , increased omega-3 -linolenic  acid [  ALA  ]  , and increased  omega-6 PUFA )  ( Supplement Table 6 ) . Figure 1 . Evidence search and selection . RCT = r and omized controlled trial . Quality Assessment All included studies were  trial-level meta-analyses ( 7 , 2228 )  , except the study by Mente and colleagues , which was a patient-level  analysis of 4  studies ( 29 ) ( Supplement Table 4 ) . All trial-level systematic review s reported comprehensive search and selection criteria as well as quality assessment of studies by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool ( 30 ) . Six systematic review s primarily used r and om-effects models for meta-analyses , of which 4 used fixed-effects models for sensitivity analyses . Two studies primarily used."
"yThe objective of this study was to provide an up-to- date summary of the current evidence that may be useful for updating guidelines . We comprehensively search ed the published literature s and conferences for studies that compared  curative  with  palliative treatments  in  colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis .  The primary outcomes considered in this study were  three- and five-year overall survival rates .  We pooled data across studies and estimated summary effect sizes . Overall , patients who received  curative treatments  had improved  three-year survival  ( hazard ratio ( HR ) , 2.19 [ 95 % CI , 1.83 to 2.62 ] ) and  five-year survival  ( HR , 2.22 [ 95 % CI , 1.83 to 2.69 ] ) compared with those who received  palliative treatments .  Patients who received  curative treatments  had an increased  risk of treatment-related morbidity  ( odds ratio ( OR ) , 2.90 [ 95 % CI , 2.02 to 4.17 ] ) , but there was no significant difference in  treatment-related mortality  between patients who received  curative treatments  and those who received  palliative treatments  ( OR , 1.46 [ CI , 0.62 to 3.47 ] ) .  Curative treatments  improved  overall survival  in  colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis  and did not increase  the risk of treatment-related mortality .   Curative treatments  were associated with a  higher risk of treatment-related morbidity .  These data highlight the importance for further investigation aim ed at prevention of treatment-associated morbidity."
"  Fluticasone  given at half the daily dose of beclomethasone or  budesonide  leads to small improvements in  measures of airway calibre  , but it appears to have a higher risk of  causing sore throat  and when given at the same daily dose leads to increased  hoarseness .  There are concerns about  adrenal suppression  with  Fluticasone  given to children at doses greater than 400 mcg/day , but the r and omised trials included in this review did not provide sufficient data to address this issue."
 This review found interventions  including providing dietary advice and blood glucose level monitoring  for  women with pregnancy  hyperglycaemia not  meeting  GDM  and  T2DM diagnostic criteria helped reduce the number  of macrosomic and LGA babies  without increasing  caesarean section and operative vaginal birth rates  . It is important to notice that the results of this review were based on four small r and omised trials with moderate to high risk of bias without  follow-up outcomes  for both women and their  babies .
"yNeoadjuvant  therapy  followed by  surgery  is a st and ard treatment for  locally advanced oesophageal cancer .  However , the roles of  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy  in treating oesophageal cancer remain controversial . In this comprehensive meta- analysis , we examine the efficacy of  adding radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  for treating  oesophageal cancer  as reported in qualified r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library data bases , Google Scholar and the American Society of Clinical Oncology data base to identify  relevant studies up to 31 March 2016 .  Data including the  pathological complete response rate , R0 resection rate and 3-year survival rate  were extracted and analysed .  Five qualified RCTs were included with a total of 709 patients .  Meta- analysis showed that  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  significantly increases the  rates of pathological complete response and R0 resection  in  patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) .  However , we found a significantly  increased 3-year survival rate  only in  oesophageal SCC patients  treated with  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  compared with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  ( 56.8 and 42.8 % , respectively ) ;  relative risk  ( RR ) : 1.31 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.10 - 1.58 , P = 0.003 ] . In  oesophageal adenocarcinoma patients  , no significant  survival benefit  of  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  was found compared with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  alone ( 46.3 and 41.0 % , respectively ; RR : 1.13 , 95 % CI 0.88 - 1.45 , P = 0.34 ) . Our meta- analysis adds to the evidence showing that  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  should be the st and ard preoperative treatment strategy for locally advanced oesophageal  SCC  . For oesophageal adenocarcinoma ,  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  alone may be the best preoperative treatment strategy to avoid the risk of  adverse effects  of radiotherapy."
"tMolecular subtyping confirms that breast cancer comprises at least four genetically distinct entities based on the expression of specific genes including estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and HER2/neu receptor . The quantitative influence of subtype on  ipsilateral locoregional recurrence ( LRR )  is unknown . The aim of this study was to systematic ally appraise the influence of breast cancer subtype on  LRR  following  breast conserving therapy ( BCT )  and  mastectomy .  A comprehensive search for studies examining outcomes after  BCT and /or mastectomy  according to breast cancer subtype was performed using Medline and cross-referencing available data . Review s of each study were conducted and data extracted to perform meta- analysis . Primary outcome was  LRR  related to breast cancer subtype .  A total of 12,592 breast cancer patients who underwent either  BCT  ( n = 7,174 ) or  mastectomy  ( n = 5,418 ) were identified from 15 studies . Patients with luminal subtype tumors  ( ER/PR + ve ) had a lower  risk of LRR  than both triple-negative ( RR 0.38 ; 95 % CI 0.23–0.61 ) ; and HER2/neu-overexpressing ( RR 0.34 ; 95 % CI 0.26–0.45 ) tumors following BCT . Luminal tumors were also less likely to  develop LRR  than HER2/neu-overexpressing ( OR 0.69 ; 95 % CI 0.54–0.89 ) or triple-negative tumors ( OR 0.61 ; 95 % CI 0.46–0.79 ) after mastectomy . HER2/neu-overexpressing tumors have  increased risk of LRR  compared to triple-negative tumors ( RR 1.44 ; 95 % CI 1.06–1.95 ) following BCT but there was no difference  in LRR  between HER2/neu-overexpressing and triple-negative tumors following mastectomy ( RR 0.91 ; 95 % CI 0.68–1.22 ) . Luminal tumors exhibit the  lowest rates of LRR  . Patients with triple-negative  and  HER2/neu-overexpressing breast tumors are at increased risk of developing  LRR  following  BCT  or  mastectomy .  Breast cancer subtype should be taken into account when considering local control and identifies those at increased risk of LRR , who may benefit from more aggressive local treatment."

" Our results support current season vaccination regardless of prior season vaccination because VE for vaccination in the current season only is higher compared to no vaccination in either season for all types/subtypes , and for H1N1 and influenza B , vaccination in both seasons provides  better  VE than vaccination in the prior season only .  Although  VE was lower against H3N2 and B for individuals vaccinated in both seasons compared to those vaccinated in the current season only , it should be noted that past vaccination history can not be altered and this comparison disregards susceptibility to influenza during the prior season among those vaccinated in the current season only . In addition , our results for H3N2 were particularly influenced by the 2014–2015 influenza season and the impact of  repeated vaccination  for all types/subtypes may vary from season to season . It is important that future VE studies include vaccination history over multiple seasons to evaluate  repeated vaccination  in more detail."
" The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of  mistletoe extracts  has impact on  survival  or leads to an improved  ability to fight cancer  or to withst and anticancer treatments is weak . Nevertheless , there is some evidence that  mistletoe extracts  may offer benefits on measures of  QOL  during chemotherapy for breast cancer , but these results need replication . Overall , more high quality , independent clinical research is needed to truly assess the safety and effectiveness of  mistletoe extracts .   Patients receiving  mistletoe therapy   should be encouraged to take part in future trails."
" Some evidence suggests clear advantages for VI/FF , in combination , compared with placebo , particularly for  forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 )  and  peak expiratory flow ;  however , the variety of questions addressed in the included studies did not allow review authors to draw firm conclusions . Information was insufficient for assessment of whether once-daily VI/FF was better or worse than twice-daily FP/SAL in terms of  efficacy  or safety  .  It is clear that more research is required to reduce the uncertainties that surround interpretation of these studies . It will be necessary for these findings to be replicated in other work before more robust conclusions are revealed . Only five of the  13  included studies provided data on  health-related quality of life  , and only six recorded  asthma exacerbations .  Only one study focused on  paediatric patients  , so no conclusions can be drawn for the paediatric population .

"eContinuous  positive airway pressure ( CPAP )  is the st and ard treatment for moderate-to-severe  obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) .  However , adherence to CPAP is limited and  non-CPAP  therapies are frequently explored .  Oral appliance ( OA ) therapy  is currently widely used for the treatment of  snoring , mild , moderate and severe OSA .  The most commonly used and studied OA consists of a  maxillary and m and ibular splint  which hold the lower jaw forward during sleep . The  efficacy  of  OA  is inferior to  CPAP ;  however , the  effectiveness  as measured  by sleepiness , quality of life , endothelial function and blood pressure  is similar likely due to higher acceptance and subjective adherence . Upper airway stimulation augments neural drive by unilaterally stimulating the hypoglossal nerve .

A high upfront cost and variable response are the main limitations .  Oropharyngeal exercises  consist of a set of isometric and isotonic exercises involving the tongue , soft palate and lateral pharyngeal wall . The collective reported trials ( n = 120 ) showed that  oropharyngeal exercises  can  ameliorate OSA and snoring  ( ~30 - 40 % ) . Nasal  EPAP  devices consist of disposable one-way resister valve . A systematic review ( n = 345 ) showed that  nasal EPAP reduced OSA severity  by 53 % . The  Winx  device consists of a mouthpiece placed inside the oral cavity that is connected by tubing to a console that generates negative pressure .  Winx  may provide successful therapy for ~30 - 40 % of  OSA  patients . In conclusion , several  non-CPAP therapies  to treat OSA are currently available."
" The results of this meta- analysis support the  therapeutic  efficacy  of adjuvant interferon alpha  for the treatment of  people with high-risk ( AJCC TNM stage II-III ) cutaneous melanoma  in terms of  both disease-free survival  and , though to a lower  extent  ,  overall  survival  . Interferon  is also valid as a reference treatment in RCTs investigating new therapeutic agents for the adjuvant treatment of this participant population . Further investigation is required to select people who are most likely to benefit from this treatment."
" There are insufficient RCT data available to assess the effects of preconception care for  diabetic women  on health outcomes for mothers and their infants . More high- quality evidence is needed to determine the effects of different protocol s of preconception care for diabetic women . Future trials should be powered to evaluate effects on  short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes  , and outcomes relating to the  use and costs of health services .  We have identified three ongoing studies that we will consider in the next review up date."
" There is very low quality evidence that  pancreatic resection  increases  survival and decreases costs  compared to  palliative treatments  for  selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and venous involvement .  When sufficient expertise is available ,  pancreatic resection  could be considered for  selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer  who are willing to accept the potentially increased  morbidity  associated with the procedure . Further r and omised controlled trials are necessary to increase confidence in the estimate of effect and to assess the  quality of life  of patients and the cost-effectiveness of  pancreatic resection versus palliative treatment  for locally advanced pancreatic cancer."

" We identified significant clinical heterogeneity in the 10 included trials . Results are based upon the findings of several ( five ) trials that included an  "" open lung ventilation strategy ""  , whereby the intervention group differed from the control group in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre ( including co- interventions such as higher PEEP , different modes of ventilation and higher plateau pressure ) , making interpretation of the results difficult . A ventilation strategy that included recruitment manoeuvres in participants with ARDS reduced  intensive care unit mortality  without increasing the  risk of barotrauma  but had no effect on  28-day and hospital mortality .  We down grade d the quality of the evidence to low , as most of the included trials provided  co- interventions  as part of an  open lung ventilation  strategy , and this might have influenced results of the outcome."
" There is no clear evidence for efficacy of any of the  adjuvant and neo-adjuvant  protocol s review ed , but there is some evidence to suggest that  adjuvant therapy  may be beneficial offering prolonged  disease-free survival .  In order to detect a realistic treatment advantage , larger trials with lower risk of systematic error will have to be conducted."
"sBackground Multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , and hemiplegia are common disorders that directly cause impairment of  balance  and gait  .   Aquatic exercises  are used for neurological rehabilitation . It is suggested that the contributing factors of the water setting such as buoyancy , viscosity , and hydrostatic pressure offer an ideal environment for rehabilitative programmes . Objective To conduct a systematic review of studies that assess the effect of  aquatic exercises  on balance in  neurological patients ( i.e. , patients with multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , and hemiplegia ) .  Methods A systematic literature search of  six data bases  ( MEDLINE , PEDro , AMED , CINAHL , Embase , SPORTD iscus ) for r and omized controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials on  aquatic exercises  in three different neurological disorders , namely , multiple  sclerosis  ,  Parkinson 's disease  , and  hemiplegia  , was performed . Reference lists from identified studies were manually search ed for additional studies . Method ological quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist . The data were analyzed and synthesized by two independent review ers . Disagreements in extracted data were resolved by discussion among the review ers . Results The method ological quality of eight studies included in this review ranged from fair to good . The findings illustrated that there were statistically significant  improvements  in  static and dynamic balance  in  patients with multiple sclerosis and hemiplegia .  The statistically significant improvements in  gait ability  were only found in the studies conducted on multiple sclerosis . No conclusions can be drawn in Parkinson 's population s as only two trials conducted with a small sample size were available . Conclusion  Aquatic exercises  may be effective at improving  balance impairment  in  patients with hemiplegia and multiple sclerosis .  There is a need for further research investigating its effect on Parkinson 's disease before encouraging the use of aquatic exercises."

"sOBJECTIVE To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of available  tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors ( anti-TNFs )  for the management of  psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) in patients with an inadequate response to  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs  ( DMARDs ) .  METHODS We used an exhaustive search strategy covering r and omized clinical trials , systematic review s and health technology assessment s ( HTA ) published on anti-TNFs for PsA. We performed indirect comparisons of the available  anti-TNFs ( adalimumab , etanercept , golimumab , and infliximab )  measuring  relative risks ( RR ) for the psoriatic arthritis response criteria ( PsARC ) , mean differences ( MDs ) for improvements from baseline for the Health Assessment Question naire ( HAQ )  by PsARC responders and non-responders , and  MD  for  the improvements from baseline for the psoriasis area and severity index ( PASI ) .  When the reporting of data on intervention group response rates and improvements were incomplete , we used straightforward conversions based on the available data . RESULTS We retrieved data from  20 publications representing seven trials , as well as two HTAs .  All anti-TNFs were significantly better than control , but the indirect comparison did not reveal any statistically significant difference between the anti-TNFs . For PsARC  response  , golimumab yielded the  highest RR  and etanercept the second highest ; adalimumab and  infliximab  both yielded  notably smaller RRs . For HAQ improvement  , etanercept and infliximab yielded the  largest MD  among PsARC responders . For PsARC nonresponders , etanercept , infliximab , and golimumab yielded  similar MDs  , and adalimumab a notably  lower MD . For PASI improvement  , infliximab yielded the  largest  MD and golimumab the second largest , while etanercept yielded the smallest MD . In some instances , the estimated magnitudes of effect were notably different from the estimates of previous HTA indirect comparisons .  There is insufficient statistical evidence to demonstrate differences in effectiveness between available anti-TNFs for PsA. Effect estimates seem sensitive to the analytic approach , and this uncertainty should be taken into account in future economic evaluations."
" In  prepubescent school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma  , a small but statistically significant group difference in  growth velocity  was observed between low doses of  ICS  and low to medium doses of  HFA-beclomethasone equivalent  , favouring the use of low-dose  ICS .  No apparent difference in the magnitude of effect was associated with three molecules reporting one-year  growth velocity  , namely , mometasone , ciclesonide and fluticasone . In view of prevailing parents ' and physicians ' concerns about the  growth suppressive  effect of ICS , lack of or incomplete reporting of  growth velocity  in more than 86 % ( 19/22 ) of eligible paediatric trials , including those using  beclomethasone  and  budesonide  , is a matter of concern . All future paediatric trials comparing different doses of  ICS  with or without  placebo  should systematic ally document growth . Findings support use of the minimal effective ICS dose in children with asthma . PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Does altering the dose of inhaled corticosteroids make a difference in  growth among   children with asthma  ? BACKGROUND Asthma guidelines recommend  inhaled corticosteroids  (  ICS  ) as the first choice of treatment for  children with persistent asthma  that is not well controlled when only a reliever inhaler is used to treat symptoms . Steroids work by reducing inflammation in the lungs and are known to control underlying symptoms of asthma . However , parents and physicians remain concerned about the potential  negative effect of ICS  on  growth .  REVIEW QUESTION Does altering the dose of inhaled corticosteroids make a difference in the  growth of  children  with asthma  ? WHAT EVIDENCE DID WE FIND ? : We studied whether a difference could be seen in the  growth  of  children with persistent asthma  who were using different doses of the same ICS molecule and the same delivery device . We found  22 eligible trials  , but only 10 of them measured  growth or other measures of interest .  Overall ,  3394 children included in the review combined  17 group comparisons ( i.e. 17 groups of  children with mild to moderate asthma  using a particular dose and type of steroid in 10 trials ) . Trials used different ICS molecules (  beclomethasone ,  budesonide  , ciclesonide , fluticasone or mometasone )  either on their own or in combination with a long-acting  beta2 -agonist  ( a drug used to open up the airways ) and generally compared low doses of  corticosteroids  ( 50 to 100 μg ) with  low to medium  ( 200 μg )  doses of corticosteroids  ( converted in μg  HFA-beclomethasone  equivalent ) over 12 to 52 weeks . RESULTS We found a small but statistically significant group  difference in growth over 12 months  between these different doses clearly favouring the lower dose  of ICS  . The type of corticosteroid among newer molecules  (  ciclesonide ,  fluticasone  , mometasone ) did not seem to influence the impact on  growth  over one year . Differences in corticosteroid doses did not seem to affect the  change in height , the gain in weight , the gain in bone mass index and the maturation of bones .  QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE : This review is based on a small number of trials that reported data and were conducted on  children with mild to moderate asthma .  Only  10 of 22 studies  measured the few outcomes of interest for this review , and only four comparisons  reported growth over 12 months  . Our confidence in the quality of evidence is high for this outcome , however it is low to moderate for several other outcomes , depending on the number of trials reporting these outcomes . Moreover , a few outcomes were reported only by a single trial ; as these findings have not been confirmed by other trials , we down grade d the evidence for these outcomes to low quality . An insufficient number of trials have compared the effect of a larger difference in dose , for example , between a high dose and a low dose of ICS and of other popular molecules such as budesonide and beclomethasone over a year or longer of treatment .  We report an evidence -based ICS dose-dependent  reduction in growth velocity  in  prepubescent school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma .  The choice of ICS molecule  ( mometasone , ciclesonide or fluticasone )  was not found to affect the level of  growth velocity  response over a year . The  effect of corticosteroids on growth  was not consistently reported : among  22 eligible trials  , only four comparisons reported the  effects of corticosteroids on growth  over one year . In view of parents ' and clinicians ' concerns , lack of or incomplete reporting of growth is a matter of concern given the importance of the topic . We recommend that growth be systematic ally reported in all trials involving children  taking  ICS for three months or longer . Until further data comparing low versus high ICS dose and trials of longer duration are available , we recommend that the minimal effective ICS dose be used in all children with asthma."

" : NIV for ARF in these setting s appears to  be effective  . HighlightsAcute  respiratory failure  is a common indication for hospital admission in  children and adults in low/middle‐income countries .  Since access to invasive ventilation is limited , non‐invasive ventilation is an attractive alternative in selected patients .We systematic ally review ed the impact of  non‐invasive ventilation  for acute respiratory failure/peri‐extubation in this setting .We found  54  studies , mostly from South Asia .  Non‐invasive ventilation  was associated with  reasonable risks of mortality , endotracheal intubation , and treatment failure .   Non‐invasive ventilation  seemed  safe  in  children and adults with acute respiratory failure/peri‐extubation  in these countries."
"dBACKGROUND Malnutrition and dehydration are widespread in  older people  , and obesity is an increasing problem . In clinical practice , it is often unclear which strategies are suitable and effective in counteracting these key health threats . AIM To provide evidence -based recommendations for  clinical nutrition and hydration  in  older persons  in order to prevent and /or treat  malnutrition  and  dehydration .  Further , to address whether weight-reducing interventions are appropriate for  overweight or obese older persons .  METHODS This guideline was developed according to the st and ard operating procedure for ESPEN guidelines and consensus papers . A systematic literature search for systematic review s and primary studies was performed based on 33 clinical questions in PICO format . Existing evidence was grade d according to the SIGN grading system . Recommendations were developed and agreed in a multistage consensus process . RESULTS We provide  eighty-two evidence -based recommendations  for  nutritional care in older persons  , covering four main topics : Basic questions and general principles , recommendations for  older persons  with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition , recommendations for  older patients  with specific diseases , and recommendations to prevent , identify and treat dehydration . Overall , we recommend that all  older persons  shall routinely be screened for malnutrition in order to identify an existing risk early .  Oral nutrition  can be  supported  by  nursing interventions , education , nutritional counseling , food modification and oral nutritional supplements . Enteral nutrition  should be initiated if oral , and parenteral if enteral nutrition is insufficient or impossible and the general prognosis is altogether favorable . Dietary restrictions should generally be avoided , and  weight-reducing diets  shall only be considered in  obese older persons with weight-related health problems  and combined with physical exercise . All  older persons  should be considered to be at risk of low-intake  dehydration  and encouraged to consume adequate amounts of drinks . Generally , interventions shall be individualized , comprehensive and part of a multimodal and multidisciplinary team approach .  A range of effective interventions is available to support adequate nutrition and hydration in  older persons  in order to maintain  or improve nutritional status and improve clinical course and quality of life .  These interventions should be implemented in clinical practice and routinely used."

"lINTRODUCTION  Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV )  is included in the World Health Organization 's routine immunization schedule and is recommended by WHO for vaccination in  high-risk children up to 60 months .  However , many countries do not recommend vaccination in older  age  groups , nor have donors committed to supporting extended age group vaccination . To better inform decision-making , this systematic review examines the direct impact of  extended age group vaccination  in  children over 12 months in low and middle income countries .  METHODS An a priori protocol was used . Using pre-specified terms , a search was conducted using PubMed , LILACS , Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , CAB Abstract s , clinical trials.gov and the International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases abstract s. The primary outcome was  disease incidence ,  with  antibody titers and nasopharyngeal carriage  included as secondary outcomes . RESULTS Eighteen studies reported on  disease incidence , immune response , and nasopharyngeal carriage .   PCV  administered after 12 months of age led to significant declines in  invasive pneumococcal disease . Immune response  to vaccine type serotypes was significantly higher for those vaccinated at older ages than the unimmunized at the established 0.2 ug/ml and 0.35 ug/ml thresholds . Vaccination administered after one year of age significantly reduced  VT carriage  with odds ratios ranging from 0.213 to 0.69 over four years . A GRADE analysis indicated that the studies were of high quality . DISCUSSION  PCV  administration in children over 12 months leads to significant  protection .  The direct impact of  PCV  administration , coupled with the large cohort of children missed in first year vaccination , indicates that countries should initiate or exp and  PCV  immunization for extended age group vaccinations . Donors should support implementation of  PCV  as part of delayed or interrupted immunization for older children . For countries to effectively implement extended age vaccinations , access to affordably-priced  PCV  is critical."
" : The effects of interventions for the management of  fatigue  in IBD are uncertain . No firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions can be drawn .

"eTo evaluate the evidence supporting the effectiveness of  acupuncture  treatment for  SCI and its complications  , we conducted search across  19 electronic data bases  to find all of the r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that used  acupuncture  as a treatment for  SCI and its complications .  The method ological quality of each RCT was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the PEDro scale .  Sixteen RCTs , including 2 high- quality RCTs  ,  met our inclusion criteria ( 8 for functional recovery from SCI , 6 for bladder dysfunction , and 2 for pain control )  . The meta- analysis showed positive results for the use of  acupuncture combined with conventional treatments  for the  functional recovery  in terms of  motor ASIA scores and total FIM scores  when compared to  conventional treatments  alone . Positive results were also obtained for the treatment of  bladder dysfunction  , in terms of the  total efficacy rate  , when comparing  acupuncture  to conventional  treatments .  However , 2 RCTs for pain control reported conflicting results . Our systematic review found encouraging albeit limited evidence for  functional recovery , bladder dysfunction , and pain  in SCI . However , to obtain stronger evidence without the drawbacks of trial design and the quality of studies , we recommend sham-controlled RCTs or comparative effectiveness research for each condition to test the effectiveness of acupuncture."
" In chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , treatment with  mucolytics  is associated with a reduction in  acute exacerbations and days of illness .

"sThe purpose of this work was to assess the evidence for  effectiveness  of   acupuncture  ( AC )  treatment in  gastrointestinal diseases .  A systematic review of the Medline -cited literature for clinical trials was performed up to May 2006 . Controlled trials assessing  acupuncture point  stimulation for  patients with gastrointestinal diseases  were considered for inclusion . The search identified  18 relevant trials meeting the inclusion criteria .  Two  irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) trials  , 1  Crohn 's disease  and 1  colitis ulcerosa  trial had a robust r and om controlled trial ( RCT ) design . In regard to other gastrointestinal disorders ,  study quality  was poor . In all trials ,  quality of life ( QoL )  improved significantly independently from the kind of  acupuncture  , real or  sham . Real AC  was significantly superior to  sham acupuncture  with regard to  disease activity scores  in the Crohn and Colitis trials . Efficacy of  acupuncture  related to  QoL  in IBS may be explained by unspecific effects . This is the same for  QoL  in inflammatory bowel diseases ( IBD ) , whereas specific acupuncture  effects  may be found in clinical scores . Further trials for IBDs and in particular for all other gastrointestinal disorders would be necessary to evaluate the  efficacy  of  acupuncture  treatment . However , it must be discussed on what terms patients benefit when this harmless and obviously powerful therapy with regard to  QoL  is demystified by further  placebo  controlled trials."
"2OBJECTIVES We were commissioned by the behavioural insights team at Public Health Engl and to synthesis e the evidence on  choice architecture interventions  to increase  healthy purchasing and /or consumption  of food and drink  by National Health Service ( NHS ) staff .  DATA SOURCES MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials , PsycINFO , Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstract s and Web of Science were search ed from inception until May 2017 and references were screened independently by two review ers . DESIGN A systematic review that included r and omised experimental or intervention studies , interrupted time series and controlled before and after studies . PARTICIPANTS  Healthcare staff of high-income countries .  INTERVENTION  Choice architecture interventions  that aim ed to improve  dietary purchasing and /or consumption ( outcomes )  of  staff .  APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS Eligibility assessment , quality appraisal , data abstract ion and analysis were completed by two review ers . Quality appraisal of r and omised trials was informed by the Cochrane H and book , and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonr and omized Studies was used for the remainder . Findings were narratively synthesis ed . RESULTS  Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria . Five studies included multiple workplaces ( including healthcare setting s ) , 13 were conducted in healthcare setting s only .  Interventions in 10 studies were  choice architecture  only and 8 studies involved a  complex intervention with a choice architecture element .  Interventions involving  a  proximity element   ( making behavioural options easier or harder to engage with ) appear to be frequently  effective  at  changing behaviour .  One study presented an  effective sizing intervention .  Labelling alone was generally not  effective  at  changing purchasing behaviour .  Interventions including an availability element were generally reported to be successful at  changing behaviour  but no included study examined this element alone . There was no strong evidence for the  effect of pricing on purchasing or dietary intake .    Proximity , availability  and  sizing  are  choice architecture  elements that are likely to be effective for NHS  organisations  . TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42017064872."
"  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy  increases  overall survival and progression-free survival  from advanced ovarian cancer . The results of this meta- analysis provide the most reliable estimates of the  relative survival benefits  of  IP  over  IV therapy  and should be used as part of the decision making process .

" The research suggests that formal education involving mixed methods of written , visual , interactive and verbal material in a structured or repeated session , was effective in significantly improving  parental knowledge  about fever management in  children .  IMPLICATION S FOR RESEARCH What is required are more studies of the formal investigations included in this review which have been shown to be effective , with replication of the outcome measures . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE Those  strategies  delivered by health care providers , formal in structure , and relevant to current situations , i.e. in close proximity to the time of fever , with multidimensional methods , and reinforced , have been shown to be more effective in improving parental  management  of  fever  in their child .  One-dimensional  methods such as  written material  alone did not appear to be statistically significant in affecting  behaviours  , however did decrease anxiety and improve satisfaction."
" We found evidence that preoperative IMT was associated with a reduction of  postoperative atelectasis , pneumonia , and duration of hospital stay  in  adults undergoing cardiac and major abdominal surgery .  The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to lack of adequate blinding , small- study effects , and publication bias needs to be considered when interpreting the present findings."
"sThere are wide variations in the macronutrient values adopted by  neonatal intensive care units  and industry to fortify milk in efforts to achieve recommended intakes for  preterm infants .  Contributing to this is the variation in macronutrient composition of  preterm milk  between and within  mothers  and the variable quality of milk analyses used to determine the macronutrient content of milk . We conducted a systematic review of the literature using  articles published in English between 1959 and 2013 that  reported the concentrations of  one or more macronutrients or  energy content in  human preterm milk  , sample d over a representative 24-h period . Search ed medical data bases included Ovid Medline , Scopus , CINAHL and the Cochrane Library . Results are presented as mean values and ranges for each macronutrient during weeks 1 - 8 of lactation , and preferred mean values ( g/100 ml ) for colostrum ( week 1 ) and mature milk ( weeks 2 - 8 ; protein : 1·27 , fat : 3·46 , lactose : 6·15 and carbohydrate : 7·34 ) , using data from studies employing the highest- quality analyses . Industry-directed fortification practice s using these mean values fail to meet protein targets for infants weighing < 1000 g when the fortified milk is fed < 170 - 190 ml/kg per d , and the protein  :  energy ratio of the fortified milk is inadequate . This study aim ed to provide additional information to industry in order to guide their future formulation of breast milk fortifiers . Quality macronutrient analyses of adequately sample d preterm breast milk would improve our underst and ing of the level of fortification needed to meet recommended protein and energy intakes and growth targets , as well as support st and ardised reporting of nutritional outcomes."

"tObjective : This systematic review aim ed to investigate the effects of interventions intended for retraining  leg somatosensory function  on somatosensory impairment , and secondary outcomes of balance and gait ,  after stroke .  Data sources : Data bases search ed from inception  to 16 January 2019  included Cochrane Library , PubMed , MEDLINE , CINAHL , EMBASE , PEDro , PsycINFO , and Scopus . Reference lists of relevant publications were also manually search ed . Review methods : All types of quantitative studies incorporating interventions that intended to improve somatosensory function in the leg  post stroke  were retrieved . The Quality  Assessment Tool  for Quantitative Studies was used for quality appraisal .  St and ardised mean differences  were calculated and meta-analyses were performed using preconstructed Microsoft Excel spreadsheets . Results : The search  yielded 16 studies , comprising 430 participants , using a diverse range of interventions .  In total , 10 of the included studies were rated weak in quality , 6 were rated moderate , and none was rated strong . Study quality was predominantly affected by high risk of selection bias , lack of blinding , and the use of somatosensory measures that have not been psychometrically evaluated . A significant heterogeneous positive  summary effect size ( SES )  was found for  somatosensory outcomes  ( SES : 0.52 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.04 to 1.01 ; I2 = 74.48 % ) , which included  joint position sense , light touch , and two-point discrimination .  There was also a significant heterogeneous positive SES for  Berg Balance Scale scores  ( SES : 0.62 ; 95 % CI : 0.10 to 1.14 ; I2 = 59.05 % ) .  Gait  SES , mainly of  gait velocity  , was not significant . Conclusion : This review suggests that interventions used for retraining leg somatosensory impairment after stroke significantly  improved somatosensory function  and balance but not gait."
 The strength of the evidence is not sufficient to determine whether stepping down the dose of ICS is of net benefit ( in terms of fewer  adverse effects  ) or harm ( in terms of  reduced effectiveness of treatment  ) for  adult patients with well-controlled asthma .  A small number of relevant studies and varied outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform . Additional well- design ed RCTs of longer duration are needed to inform clinical practice regarding use of a ' stepping down ICS ' strategy for patients with well-controlled asthma.
"rBackground Recommendations for improved  survival  after  cancer  through  physical activity ( PA )  exist , although the evidence is still emerging . Our primary objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis of the association between prediagnosis and postdiagnosis  PA  and  survival  ( cancer-specific , all-cause , and cardiovascular disease mortality ) for  all cancers and by tumor site .  Secondary objectives were to examine the associations within population subgroups , by PA domain , and to determine the optimal dose of PA related to  survival  . Methods PubMed , EMBASE , and SportsDiscus data bases were search ed from inception to November 1 , 2018 . DerSimonian-Laird r and om-effects models were used to estimate the summary hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for primary and secondary analyses and to conduct dose-response analyses . Results Evidence from  136 studies  showed  improved survival outcomes  with highest vs lowest levels of prediagnosis or postdiagnosis total or recreational PA for all-cancers combined ( cancer specific mortality : HR = 0.82 , 95 % CI = 0.79 to 0.86 , and HR = 0.63 , 95 % CI = 0.53 to 0.75 , respectively ) as well as for 11 specific cancer sites . For breast and colorectal cancers , greater reductions were observed for postdiagnosis  PA  ( HR = 0.58 - 0.63 ) compared with prediagnosis  PA  ( HR = 0.80 - 0.86 ) for  cancer-specific and all-cause mortality . Survival benefits  through  PA  were observed in most subgroups ( within sex , body mass index , menopausal status , colorectal subtypes , and PA domain ) examined . Inverse dose-response relationships  between  PA  and breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality  were observed , with steep reductions in hazards to 10 - 15 metabolic equivalent hours per week . Conclusion Higher prediagnosis and postdiagnosis levels of  PA  were associated with  improved survival outcomes  for at least 11 cancer types , providing support for global promotion of PA guidelines following cancer."

The quality of included studies was assessed and data were extracted in a systematic way . Results  A series of 5513 citations was obtained . Ninety-nine articles were retained and fully review ed  , yielding  four included studies .  No difference in the  Hidden Figure Test score  after one year was observed after residency training in General Surgery of at least nine months . A first-year dental curriculum was not found to elevate the  Novel Object Cross-Sections Test score  ( P = 0.07 ) . A two-semester learning period of  abdominal sonography  was found to increase the  Revised Minnesota Paper Form Board Test score  ( P < 0.05 ) . A h and s-on radiology course using interactive three-dimensional image post-processing software consisting of seven two-hour long seminars on a weekly basis was found to amplify the  Cube Perspective Test score  ( P < 0.001 ) . Conclusion  Spatial abilities  tests scores were enhanced by courses in abdominal sonography and h and s-on radiology , but were not improved by residency training in General Surgery and first-year dental curriculum."
"sLaryngeal cancer is the second most common cancer of the respiratory tract with a relative 5-year survival over all tumour sites in the USA ( 61.6 % ; SEER 2009 ) , which is much better than other head and neck cancers . The aim of this paper is to review and summarise data on the survival of  laryngeal cancer patients .  Literature search was conducted to identify articles in PubMed up to June 2009 .  Thirty studies with different study aims including sufficient information on survival of laryngeal cancer patients were identified .  The  5-year overall survival  ranged from 0 to 100 % , depending on the T- and N-category , therapeutic approach and tumour location . The involvement of other factors such as genetics , nutrition and lifestyle habits remains uncertain . Our meta- analysis on a subgroup of published studies yielded an  overall 5-year relative survival rate  of 64.2 % ( 95 % confidence interval 63.7–64.7 % ) . Different study aims and patient selection criteria prohibit general conclusions . However , this review may provide an actual picture of the complexity of factors influencing the  survival  of laryngeal cancer patients."
" Considering the treatments investigated , the most favorable evidence indicates the use of  lanolin  alone or in association with breast protection shells and breast milk expressed and rubbed into the nipple and areola after each feeding session . However , the results obtained in this review are inconclusive , indicating the need for further studies in order to clarify the action of breast milk and  lanolin  on the damaged tissues , as well as studies involving sample s representative of the number needed to treat . CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study provides evidence for nursing practice , thus contributing to the improvement of  lactating mothers with nipple trauma care  and , consequently , improving the rates of  successful breastfeeding  as well as the  quality of life  of breastfeeding mothers."
"  Community-based peer  support  for mothers  is  effective  in increasing  the duration of exclusive breastfeeding  , particularly for  infants aged 3 - 6 months in low- and middle-income countries .  Such support also encourages mothers to initiate breastfeeding early and prevents newborn prelacteal feeding."
" Clinicians must consider the type and severity of impairments in cognitive domains to tailor management . Awareness of depression , self-confidence and support access may modulate self-care ability."
" The effects of training on  death and dependence  after  stroke  are unclear . Cardiorespiratory training reduces  disability  after stroke and this may be mediated by  improved mobility and balance .  There is sufficient evidence to incorporate  cardiorespiratory and mixed training  , involving  walking  , within  post-stroke rehabilitation programs  to improve the  speed and tolerance of walking ;  improvement in  balance  may also occur . There is insufficient evidence to support the use of  resistance training .  Further well- design ed trials are needed to determine the optimal content of the exercise prescription and identify long-term benefits."
"oOBJECTIVE To determine the protective effect of  sodium fluoride  on the  deterioration of  hearing loss  in adult patients with otosclerosis .  DATA SOURCES PubMed , Embase , the Cochrane Library , and CINAHL . STUDY SELECTION A systematic literature search was conducted . Studies reporting original study data on the   deterioration of hearing loss  in otosclerosis patients treated with  sodium fluoride   were included . DATA EXTRACTION  Directness of evidence ( DoE )  and  risk of bias ( RoB )  , using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool for assessing risk of bias , of the selected articles were assessed . Studies with low DoE , high RoB , or both were excluded .  Absolute risks , mean deterioration of hearing in decibels , risk differences , and their 95 % confidence intervals  were extracted from the included studies . DATA SYNTHESIS Our search  yielded 168 original titles , of which  ,  2   placebo-controlled  studies were eligible for data extraction . The results of these 2 studies were conflicting . One of the included studies , with high DoE and moderate RoB , reported an  absolute risk reduction for deterioration of hearing loss  of 18 % [ 95 % CI 17 ; 19 ] when treating with  sodium fluoride .  The other included study , with high DoE and moderate RoB , reported no clinical ly significant difference in  mean deterioration of bone-conduction , air-conduction , or air-bone gap  between the  sodium fluoride  group and the  placebo  group .  There is weak evidence from one study with significant limitations that  deterioration of  hearing  loss  in  otosclerosis patients receiving  sodium fluoride  treatment  is less than in patients treated with a placebo."
 This meta- analysis showed  that CRT  showed no significant effect  on OS and PFS  when  compared to non-CRT . Neoadjuvant CRT  showed no significant effect over postoperative adjuvant CRT.
 : Results of this systematic review and meta‐ analysis show a discrepancy  in oncological outcomes  for  patients  undergoing SBRT  for suspected early‐stage NSCLC in whom there  is  pathologic conformation of malignancy  and  those who there  is only a clinical  diagnose of NSCLC .  These results emphasize the importance of obtaining pathologic proof of malignancy.
"sCONTEXT  Cancer caregivers  have information and support needs , especially about cancer pain management . With high Internet use reported among  caregivers  , YouTube may be an accessible option when looking for information on cancer pain management . OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to explore the availability and characteristics of  instructional cancer pain management videos on YouTube  and determine to what extent these videos addressed the role of  informal caregivers  in cancer pain management . METHODS A systematic review of  videos on YouTube  result ing from search terms "" pain and cancer , "" "" pain and hospice , "" and "" pain and palliative care "" was conducted in  May 2013 .  If the video addressed pain management , was in English , and was instructional , it was coded for the scope and design of instructional content that included caregivers . RESULTS The search terms yielded  1118 unique videos  , and  43 videos met  the inclusion criteria . Overall , 63 % of videos were viewed 500 times or less , and half of the videos received  "" like "" ratings  by viewers . Video instruction was primarily talk without any onscreen action ( 65 % ) , user-generated amateur video ( 79 % ) , and had poor quality sources of information . Videos were mainly clinician centered ( 77 % ) . Although most videos addressed the need for  caregiver pain assessment  ( 35 % ) and  caregiver education  ( 23 % ) , few actually addressed specific  caregiver pain management barriers .   Most videos were primarily directed toward a clinical audience . Future research is necessary to determine if the platform is feasible and beneficial as a support tool for oncology caregivers."
" Since the last version of this review , one new study has been identified for inclusion . The best evidence to date comes from this CCT , which provides low quality evidence that  higher intensity ambulatory ( outpatient ) multidisciplinary rehabilitation  reduces  short- and long-term disability  in  people with brain tumour  compared with  st and ard outpatient care .  Our conclusions are tentative at best , given gaps in current research in this area . Although the strength of evidence has increased with the identification of a new controlled clinical trial in this up date d review , further research is needed into appropriate and robust study design  s ; outcome measurement ; caregiver needs ; evaluation of optimal setting s ; type , intensity , duration of therapy ; and cost-effectiveness  of  multidisciplinary  rehabilitation in the  brain tumour  population."
"yBackground A  tracheostomy  is a surgically created opening through the anterior neck tissues and the trachea , into which a tube is inserted . Despite its influence on basic human needs such as respiration , communication and nutrition , little is known about the impact of  tracheostomy  on  patients and their caregivers  or what could be done to enable better care and quality of life ( QoL ) for these individuals . Objective The aim of this review was to better underst and the current knowledge related to the experience and QoL of  adults living with a tracheostomy and their caregivers  so as to be able to improve these experiences . Method A systematic review of the English- language , peer- review ed literature was conducted in PubMed , Scopus , PsychINFO , Google Scholar , and CINAHL data bases . Articles were eligible if they included  adult patient or lay caregiver-reported experiences of tracheostomy  .   Results Overall ,  1080 articles were identified and 17 eligible for inclusion .  Fourteen articles reported on experiences of  tracheostomy  patients , while three focused on those of their caregivers . Studies were conducted in the home setting ( n = 5 ) , on a hospital ward ( n = 4 ) , in an intensive care unit ( n = 3 ) , in an outpatient clinic ( n = 3 ) , in a rehab facility ( n = 1 ) , and online ( n = 1 ) .  Patients and their caregivers  reported a range of mostly negative experiences related to the  care , support , and management of a  tracheostomy  , speech and communication , wellbeing and QoL , disfigurement and body image , and stigma and social withdrawal .  Conclusion Few studies have published data on the patient and  caregiver  experiences with  tracheostomy  , especially in the community setting . There is a need to better underst and these experiences in order to be able to formulate strategies and provide re sources to improve the quality of care and overall QoL of  patients with a tracheostomy and their caregivers  in-hospital and in the community."
"rINTRODUCTION  Vitamin D  is essential for bone mineralization and for the subsequent maintenance of bone quality . Mineralization is part of hard callus formation and bone remodelling , processes , which are part of fracture healing . We provide a comprehensive review of the literature to summarize and clarify if possible , the cellular effects of  vitamin D  and its clinical involvement in the process of  fracture healing in human .  MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a literature search in PubMed , Embase ( OVID version ) , and Web of Science . RESULTS A total of  75  in vitro  and 30  in vivo studies were found with inconsistent results about the  cellular effect  of  vitamin D  on fracture involved  inflammatory cells , cytokines , growth factors , osteoblasts , osteoclasts  and on the process of mineralization . With only five in vitro studies performed on material derived from a fracture site and one in vivo study in fracture patients , the exact cellular role remains unclear . Seven studies investigated the circulating vitamin  D  metabolites in fracture healing . Although it appears that 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)2D3 are not affected by the occurrence of a fracture , this might not be the case with serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 . The potential clinical effect of  vitamin D  deficiency is only described in one case series and three case controlled studies , where the results tend to show no effect of a  vitamin D  deficiency . No clinical studies were found investigating solely  vitamin D supplementation .  Two clinical studies found a positive effect of   vitamin D supplementation   and   calcium   , of  increased bone mineral density or respectively increased fracture callus area at the fracture site .  One study found indirect evidence that  vitamin D  and  calcium promoted fracture healing .   Despite these results , and the presumed beneficial effect of  vitamin D  supplementation in  deficient patients  , clinical studies that address the effects of  vitamin D  deficiency or supplementation on fracture healing are scarce and remain inconclusive . We conclude that  vitamin D  has a role in fracture healing , but the available data are too inconsistent to eluci date how and in what manner."
" In  children over the age of two years with acute asthma exacerbations  ,  inhaled anticholinergics as single agent bronchodilators  were less  efficacious  than  beta(2)-agonists . Inhaled anticholinergics  were also less  efficacious  than  inhaled anticholinergics combined with beta(2)-agonists .  Inhaled  anticholinergic drugs  alone are not appropriate for use as a single agent in children with acute  asthma  exacerbations."
" On the basis of a meta- analysis , continued use of  immunomodulator therapy  after starting  anti-TNF therapy  is no more effective than  anti-TNF monotherapy  in inducing or maintaining  response or remission  . RCTs are needed to adequately assess the  efficacy  of continued immunomodulator  therapy  after anti-TNF therapy is initiated."
" This systematic review found a superior  3-year OS  after  surgery  compared with  SBRT  , which supports the need to compare both treatments in large prospect i ve , r and omized , controlled clinical trials."
"sTemporom and ibular joint ( TMJ ) osteoarthritis ( OA ) is defined as chronic joint pain caused by the progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage through an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic conditions in the TMJ1 . Although the pathophysiological etiologies of TMJ-OA are largely unknown , the excessive mechanical stress , aging processes involved with hormonal alterations , and individual heredity have been verified as risk factors for TMJ-OA . On the other h and , the increased risk factors induce a homeostatic imbalance between the anabolic ( synthesis ) and catabolic ( degeneration ) conditions in the articular cartilage of the TMJ . Subsequently , a homeostatic imbalance induces an upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines , such as interleukin (IL)-1β , tumor necrosis factor-α , and IL-6 and catabolic growth factors in the synovial fluids of the TMJ2 . Finally , upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and catabolic growth factors not only induce an increase in the  cartilage  degrading  enzymes  , such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 , MMP-3 , MMP-1 , a disintegrin , and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-4 , and ADAMTS-5 to progressively breakdown of extracellular matrix3 , but also induce the  abnormal remodeling of the subchondral bone  and the  apoptosis of chondrocytes  in the articular cartilage of TMJ . In addition , the biological linkage between the progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage of the TMJ and the occurrence of  orofacial pain  is still largely unknown . For these reasons , clinical treatments for patients with  TMJ-OA  focused only on the  relief from orofacial pain  caused by progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage . Therefore , as a strategy for maintaining the homeostasis of the synovial joints , recent studies on preventive medicine for OA attempted to shift the metabolic status of the joints from the catabolic to the anabolic state using anabolic material s.  Platelet-rich plasma ( PRP )  is blood plasma that has been enriched with platelets and contains several different growth factors and cytokines that can stimulate the healing of various tissues . Therefore ,  autologous PRP  has been considered a clinical anabolic material for  patients with chronic joint pain caused by progressive cartilage degeneration of the synovial joints .  A systematic review and meta- analysis related to the  clinical efficacy  of intra-articular  PRP  injection into the synovial joints with OA have shown significant clinical improvements4 . More recently , Kutuk et al.5 and Hegab et al.6 reported that an intra-articular  PRP  injection is an effective treatment for  TMJ-OA  through the regeneration  of fibrocartilage and cartilage , bone repair  in the TMJ . On the other h and , Bottegoni et al.7 recently reported that the intra-articular  PRP  injection into the knee joint with moderate OA showed a decreased potential in  elderly patients aged 80 years or over .  This report indicates that the intra-articular  PRP injection  for  patients with TMJ-OA  can be performed in accordance with the physiological conditions and clinical diseases of patients . Because autologous  PRP  is prepared from the patient 's own blood , the concentrated components of PRP differ according to the physiological conditions and clinical diseases of patients . For example , if  PRP  is prepared from a patient with autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis , it may have highly concentrated pro-inflammatory cytokines to accelerate the  progressive cartilage degeneration  of the TMJ . Therefore , it is important to st and ardize the clinical  PRP  preparation protocol for  patients with TMJ-OA .  Furthermore , st and ardized methods may include the  number of platelets , timing and volume of  PRP   for injection according to the physiological conditions and clinical diseases of patients."
" Current studies continue to support the use of biologic  agents  in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis , with better  efficacy and safety profiles  than traditional systemic agents . Newer  anti-IL-17 agents  and several new oral agents are in development and have shown promise in clinical trials."
"sA large body of evidence supports the cardioprotective effects of the  long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) .  There is increasing interest in the independent effects of  EPA  and  DHA  in the modulation of cardiometabolic risk factors . This systematic review aims to appraise the latest available evidence of the differential effects of  EPA and DHA  on such risk factors . A systematic literature review was conducted up to May 2017 . R and omised controlled trials were included if they met strict eligibility criteria ,  including  EPA or DHA  > 2 g/day and purity ≥  90  % . Eighteen identified articles were included , corresponding to six unique studies involving 527 participants .  Both  EPA  and  DHA   lowered triglyceride concentration  ,  with DHA  having a greater triglyceride-lowering effect .  Whilst total cholesterol levels  were largely unchanged  by EPA and DHA , DHA   increased high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol concentration  , particularly HDL₂ , and  increased low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration and LDL particle size  .  Both EPA and DHA   inhibited platelet activity  ,  whilst DHA   improved vascular function and lowered heart rate and blood pressure  to a greater extent  than EPA .  The effects  of EPA and DHA   on inflammatory markers and glycaemic control  were inconclusive ; however both  lowered oxidative stress  .  Thus , EPA and DHA  appear to have differential effects on cardiometabolic risk factors , but these need to be confirmed by larger clinical studies."
"sObjective : Polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) is a common condition amongst  women  of reproductive age that can result in increased mortality and morbidity in women due to increased risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases . The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of common treatments of PCOS on the  predictors of diabetes  in  non-diabetic PCOS women .  Material s and methods : An extensive search was performed on the publications in three medical data bases including pubmed , scopus and google scholar from 1995 till 2017 . The articles were screened based on their quality and included in this systematic review . A total of  25 articles  including cohort , r and omised controlled trial , review and meta- analysis were included in the review . Results : This systematic review revealed that the effect of   lifestyle modification   might be low in  PCOS subjects  due to high drop-out rate while the benefits of this intervention including  weight and fat reduction  may not be achieved by medical interventions .  Metformin  treatment may result in improvements in  insulin sensitivity  while its  weight reduction effect  is still not documented in  PCOS subjects .   Thiazolidendiones  might be  tolerated  by the  PCOS  subjects and may result in similar  effects  as  metformin  but this effect should be documented by further studies . Conclusion : Combination of  lifestyle modification with metformin or thiazolidinedions  might improve the outcome of the prevention strategies . On the other h and this study revealed a different response to treatments in non-obese compared with obese PCOS subjects."
"sBackground Previous systematic review s concluded that  pneumococcal vaccination   in the elderly  was  cost  effective  .  However , recently published economic evaluations state that it may not be cost effective when children are vaccinated with  higher-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines .  The literature suggests that the outcomes of vaccination in the elderly are strongly influenced by the  vaccine effectiveness (  VE  )  against the vaccine-type pneumococcal diseases ( PD ) and the impact of childhood vaccination on the vaccine-type PD incidence  in the elderly  , but the extent remains unclear . Methods We conducted a systematic literature search of cost-effectiveness studies on  vaccination in the elderly in the PubMed data base starting from 2006 .  We included studies that consider the presence of a  childhood vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) 10 and PCV13 .  We focus on methods and assumptions used in modeling VE and epidemiology of PD over time . Results  Twenty-eight economic evaluations  underwent full-text review and data extraction .  Thirteen were selected for quality assessment .  The studies with a higher quality score provide evidence that vaccinating the elderly with  PCV13  is not  cost effective  , when an ongoing rapid decline in the incidence of PCV13-type PD is modeled . A moderate persistence of PCV13 serotypes , in particular due to PCV10 childhood vaccination , makes vaccination of the  elderly  with  PCV13  more attractive . There is no agreement that combining  PCV13  with  polysaccharide vaccine PPSV23  is  cost effective .   PPSV23  is attractive when it is effective against non-invasive PD . Conclusion Method ological approaches and assumptions in modeling  VE  and the indirect effects of childhood vaccination have a major impact on outcomes of decision-analytic models and cost-effectiveness estimates . Considering recently observed trends in the epidemiology of pneumococcal serotypes , there is currently inconclusive evidence regarding the  cost effectiveness  of pneumococcal vaccination of the  elderly  due to lack of studies that model key serotypes such as serotype 3 separately from other groups of serotypes."
" Glucose infusion rate : There is insufficient evidence from trials comparing lower with higher glucose infusion rates to inform clinical practice . Large r and omized trials are needed , powered on clinical outcomes including  death , major morbidities and adverse neurodevelopment .   Insulin infusion :  The evidence review ed does not support the routine use of  insulin infusions  to prevent hyperglycemia in VLBW neonates . Further r and omized trials of insulin infusion may be justified . They should enrol  extremely low birth weight neonates  at very high risk for  hyperglycemia  and neonatal death  .  They might use real time glucose monitors if these are vali date d for clinical use . Refinement of algorithms to guide insulin infusion is needed to enable tight control of glucose concentrations within the target range."
"sBACKGROUND Early recognition and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is important to prevent  irreversible joint damage .  Anti-citrullinated  peptide  antibodies ( ACPA ) have been suggested for early diagnosis . PURPOSE To compare the  accuracy  of  ACPA  and  rheumatoid factor  in diagnosing  rheumatoid arthritis in patients with early symptoms of the disease . DATA  SOURCES  10 medical data bases from inception to September 2009 , with no language or publication restrictions , and references of included studies .  STUDY SELECTION Two independent review ers screened search es . Full articles were assessed by one review er and checked by a second review er to identify studies that reported 2 x 2 data on ACPA for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis ( by 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria ) . DATA EXTRACTION One review er abstract ed data on patient characteristics , ACPA details , and 2 x 2 data and assessed study quality by using the QUADAS tool . A second review er checked extraction s. DATA SYNTHESIS  151 studies were included  , with considerable heterogeneity in  sensitivity  ( range , 12 % to 93 % ) and  specificity  ( range , 63 % to 100 % ) . In cohort studies that investigated second-generation anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies ( anti-CCP2 ) in  patients with early rheumatoid arthritis ( < 2  years  )  , summary  sensitivity and specificity  were 57 % ( 95 % CI , 51 % to 63 % ) and 96 % ( CI , 93 % to 97 % ) , respectively . Case-control and cross-sectional studies and studies of patients with established rheumatoid arthritis all overestimated  sensitivity .  Anti-CCP2 had  greater specificity  than rheumatoid factor ( 96 % vs. 86 % ) , with similar  sensitivity .  Evidence was insufficient to ascertain whether the combination of anti-CCP2 and rheumatoid factor provides additional benefit over anti-CCP2 alone . LIMITATIONS Most studies used a diagnostic case-control design , which overestimated  sensitivity .  Items relating to study quality were rarely reported . Publication bias could not be assessed .  Anti-CCP2 should be included in the work-up of patients with early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis."
"rContext Many  people with back pain  seek treatment with  acupuncture  , but the effectiveness of  acupuncture  for low back pain is controversial . Contribution This meta- analysis of 33  r and omized  , controlled trials that compared  acupuncture with sham , other active , or no treatment  found evidence that  acupuncture  is more effective than  sham  or  no treatment  for  patients with chronic low back pain .  Evidence about  acupuncture  's effectiveness compared with other active treatments or for  patients with acute back pain  is inconclusive . Caution s Quality of included trials varied . The Editors Low back pain is the most common cause of activity limitation in  people younger than 45 years of age in the United States  and is the second most frequent reason for visits to the physician ( 1 ) . A 1997 U.S. survey showed that 54 % of  patients reporting back or neck pain  had used a  complementary therapy  within the past year ( 2 ) , while a 2002 study showed back pain to be the most common reason for visits to acupuncturists in the United States ( 3 ) . Given this high degree of public interest , the question of whether  acupuncture  alleviates low  back pain  is relevant . Before our study , at least 3 publications systematic ally review ed the primary research up to 1996 ( 4 - 6 ) . Their conclusions , limited by the paucity , heterogeneity , and poor quality of the studies , were somewhat discordant . Several new studies have since been published . Some of these studies have been review ed ( 7 ) , but the review did not take full account of study quality and did not attempt a meta- analysis of the data . We decided to undertake a new systematic review and meta- analysis to test the hypotheses that , for treating low  back pain  ,  acupuncture  is  more effective  than  penetrating and nonpenetrating sham acupuncture , other sham treatments , active treatments  ,  and no treatment .  In addition , we address the hypothesis that treatment effect size is correlated with study quality , treatment factors , and patient factors . Methods Search We search ed the following computerized data bases from their inception until August 2004 : MEDLINE ; Cochrane Central ; EMBASE ; AMED ; CINAHL ; and 2 specialized European data bases ( CISCOM in London , United Kingdom [ to February 2003 ] , and GERA in La Garde , France ) that include gray literature , such as unpublished studies and conference reports . We performed text word search es of titles and abstract s for   acupuncture  ,  electroacupuncture , percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation  , and backache , back pain , low back pain , dorsalgia  ,  and lumbago .  We contacted experts in Japan who up date d their earlier search of Igaku Chuo Zasshi ( 19872003 ) ( 8) and also h and - search ed the Journal of the Japan Society of Acupuncture and Moxibustion ( 20002004 ) . We reconsidered all studies that were included in previous review s ( 4 - 7 ) for inclusion in our review . In addition , we screened our own files , and we contacted experts in the United Kingdom , United States , Germany , Italy , Sweden , and Norway and asked them to contribute any studies of which they were aware ( see Acknowledgments ) . We obtained copies of all papers that could be reports of r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) or review s of RCTs ( 9 ) . We scanned the bibliographies of all papers retrieved for further references . We excluded unpublished reports . Study Selection  Two authors independently considered articles reporting r and om assignment of human participants to  acupuncture  or a control group for the treatment of any type of low back pain for inclusion  . We excluded  studies that included both patients with neck and low back pain  , unless the data for  patients with low back pain  were available separately . We defined  acupuncture  in an inclusive manner to reflect its use in various traditions and theoretical approaches : The intervention had to involve the insertion of needles into the skin , but not for the purpose of injection . This definition includes any intervention that the study author or authors described as  acupuncture  or that the review ers clearly identified as  acupuncture .  We excluded therapies that are similar to  acupuncture  but do not involve  needle insertion  ( for example ,  laser acupuncture and electroacupuncture without needles )  because most authorities believe acupuncture entails needle insertion ( 10 ) . We excluded trials that compared 1 form of  acupuncture  only with another form . We included studies that provided usable data for any of the following outcome measures :  pain , measures of functional status ( for example , Oswestry and Rol and Disability Question naire ) , overall improvement , return to work , and analgesic consumption .  We excluded studies that reported only  relief of pain  immediately after a single treatment with  acupuncture .  We included reports written in English , Japanese , Korean , and Chinese , as well as in Germanic ( including Sc and inavian ) and Romance language s. Where necessary , we obtained translations of essential details . When more than 1 publication described a single trial , we included only 1 report . Data Abstract ion Two authors abstract ed data independently onto a piloted spreadsheet , except in the case of nonEnglish- language articles , from which an expert extracted data and checked them in-house ( see Acknowledgments ) . Differences were settled by discussion with reference to the original article . In the few instances where disagreements persisted , we consulted an additional independent research er who is an expert in review methods . For our purpose s , we defined 3 styles of  acupuncture  and 3 methods ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 .  Acupuncture-Related  Terms and Their Relevance We extracted data for 5 outcome categories  ( pain , functional status , overall improvement , return to full work , and analgesic consumption )  where available . We extracted outcomes for all time intervals reported . We considered outcomes less than 6 weeks to be short-term , and we used the measurement closest to 3 weeks for the meta- analysis . We considered outcomes more than 6 weeks to be long-term , and we included the measurement closest to 6 months in the meta- analysis . For crossover studies , we considered the risk for carryover effects to be prohibitive , so we considered only the first group of the study . Quality Assessment We assessed the quality of the studies in 2 ways . First , by using a modification of a vali date d method ( 11 ) , we awarded a maximum of 5 points in 3 categories : r and omization ( 2 points for an appropriate method , 1 point if method not described , or 0 points for an inappropriate method ) ; blinding ( 1 point for patient blinding and 1 point if blinding was tested after treatment ) ; and  withdrawals and dropouts  ( 1 point if a statement gave full details of withdrawals and dropouts or confirmed that no patient withdrew or dropped out ) . As recommended ( 11 ) , a score of 2 points or less indicates poor quality . Second , we assessed quality by using 10 criteria taken from the Cochrane Back Review Group ( Table 2 ) ( 12 ) , used in a recent review ( 13 ) , extracted by 1 author with r and om confirmation by another author . A score of 4 points or less indicates poor quality . Table 2 . Cochrane Back Review Group Criteria List for Method ologic Quality Assessment of R and omized , Controlled Trials Quantitative Data Synthesis We placed the studies into predefined subgroups defined according to the following criteria : 1  ) acute ( 3 months ) or chronic ( > 3 months ) low back pain  ( where not described , a decision was made from the trial setting and recruitment information [ for example , we considered primary care to include acute pain and  secondary  care to cover chronic pain ] ) ; 2  )   style  of  acupuncture  ( Table 1 )  ;  and 3 )  control group ( sham acupuncture involving needle penetration , nonpenetrating sham acupuncture , sham transcutaneous electrical  nerve  stimulation [ TENS ]  [ Table 1 ] ,  no additional treatment  , and  other active treatments )  . The no-additional-treatment control grouping includes studies that administered  adjunctive treatment  , such as  physical therapy  , to both the  acupuncture  and the  control  group and also includes those studies in which the control intervention consisted of providing  patients with educational material s  on  low back pain .  The primary outcome of the review was  quantitative synthesis of the short-term effectiveness of  acupuncture  on pain  in each category . To test whether  sham acupuncture  and controlled trials of  sham TENS  were sufficiently homogeneous to combine for the secondary analyses , we used the I2 method ( 14 ) . We used Comprehensive Meta- Analysis software ( Biostat , Inc. , Englewood , New Jersey ) for data analysis . We used the inverse-variance computational model , and we used the more conservative r and om-effects model to account for the expected heterogeneity . We performed separate analyses for each main outcome measure by using st and ardized mean difference ( the Hedge g effect size ) or odds ratio , depending on the nature of the measure . For the st and ardized mean difference , 1 unit of effect size for  pain and functioning  corresponds with a 25-point difference on the  visual analogue scale ( VAS )  and a 6-point difference on the  Rol and Disability score .  Using st and ards established by the Cochrane Back Group Editorial Board , we considered a minimum 10-mm difference on the  VAS  and a 2-point difference on the  Rol and Disability score  to be clinical ly important ( 13 ) . We analyzed short-term end points and long-term end points , as defined earlier . When the studies in any predefined subgroup were clinical ly very heterogeneous or insufficient data were reported for pooling , we planned to use a narrative synthesis rather than a meta- analysis . We assessed for the likelihood of small study bias by using a funnel plot . In reports that did not provide these values , we used the method previously described ( 13 ) , in which the median is the mean and the SD is 25 % of the measure 's range . To test the effect of these assumptions , we performed a sensitivity analysis on the  short-term pain primary  outcome measure , substituting imputed mean values both 1 SD higher and 1 SD lower."
 There is some evidence that treatment of cancer-related fatigue with  methylpheni date  appears to be effective . More robust evidence indicates that treatment with hematopoietic agents appears to relieve cancer-related fatigue caused by  chemotherapy-induced  anemia . Further confirmatory trials are required for both observations.
"nZoledronic  acid  is used to treat  patients with bone metastasis  , but the optimal dosing interval remains controversial . We therefore performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to compare the  efficacy and safety  of a 12-week interval of  zoledronic acid  with the st and ard 4-week interval .  Three r and omized controlled trials comprising 2650 patients were analyzed .  Using a r and om-effects model ,  pooled risk ratios ( RRs  ) and  95 % confidence intervals  ( CIs ) were calculated . No differences in the  occurrence of skeletal-related events ( SREs :  RR = 0.98 ; 95 % CI = 0.86 - 1.12 ; P = 0.80 ) or  grade 3/4 adverse events  ( RR = 0.91 ; 95 % CI = 0.69 - 1.20 ; P = 0.52 ) were observed between the 12-week and 4-week groups . The 12-week group tended to have lower  incidences of osteonecrosis of the jaw  [ 13 ( 0.98 % ) vs. 23 ( 1.73 % ) ] and  kidney dysfunction  [ 21 ( 1.68 % ) vs. 31 ( 2.45 % ) ] than the 4-week group , though the difference did not reach statistical significance ( RR = 0.58 , 95 % CI : 0.30 - 1.12 ; P = 0.11 ) ; ( RR = 0.67 , 95 % CI : 0.39 - 1.15 , P = 0.15 ) . These data show that  zoledronic acid  administered at 12-week intervals instead of 4-week intervals does not  increase the risk of SREs  , and may reduce  the incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw and kidney dysfunction .  This suggests the 12-week interval with  zoledronic acid  may be an acceptable treatment option."
"  Chemotherapy  , in addition to  radiotherapy  and  surgery  , is associated with improved  overall survival  in  patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers .   Induction chemotherapy  may prolong  survival  by 8 to 20 % and  adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy  may prolong  survival  by up to 16 % . In  patients with unresectable tumours  ,  concomitant or alternating chemoradiotherapy  may prolong  survival  by 10 to 22 % . There is insufficient evidence as to which agent or regimen is most effective and the  additional toxicity  associated with  chemotherapy  given in addition to  radiotherapy  and /or surgery can not be quantified."
"dBackground : Recent studies indicate an increased incidence of pertussis disease in recent years . The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the  acellular vaccine   for children  ( as a replacement of current  whole cell vaccine  in the Exp and ed Program on Immunization )  and for high-risk adults in Iran  through updating current best available evidence . Methods : We performed a systematic literature review in relevant data bases we focused on previously published systematic review s to select those that address our questions . The AMSTAR ( assessing the method ological quality of systematic review s ) tool was used for screening available review s. Then search in data bases was done until Feb 2014 to up date the evidence . We pooled results using meta- analysis methods by Stata statistical package . Results :  Eleven systematic review articles  were included in the initial evaluation . In the end , two systematic review s on  acellular vaccine booster doses  and the  acellular vaccine  in children were selected as the baseline evidence . In the up date phase , new clinical trials were screened , and the results were up date d. Overall pooled  estimate of relative efficacy  of  acellular  to whole cell was 0.68 ( 95 % CI , 0.55 - 0.81 ) for children immunization Pooled estimates for the efficacy of  acellular  versus  placebo  were 0.70 ( 95 % CI , 0.60 - 0.80 ) . Overall pooled  estimate of efficacy  of booster dose of  acellular  was 0.87(95 % CI , 0.85 - 0.88 ) compared to  placebo .  In addition pooled estimate of   acellular vaccine  efficacy  based on response to antigen was 0.78(95 % CI , 0.64 - 0.93 ) in highrisk group . Conclusion : The results show higher  performance and safety  of the  acellular vaccine  in the prevention of pertussis in  children  versus the  whole cell vaccine .  Moreover , the efficacy of the  acellular vaccine  in  high-risk adult groups  is acceptable . This study provides evidence in favor of the introduction of an  acellular vaccine  to the national program of immunization . Studies on cost effectiveness and aspects of policy analysis are recommended."
"tObjectives The objective of this review was to assess the  effectiveness  of interventions that assist  caregivers to provide support for people living with dementia in the community .  Inclusion criteria Types of participants  Adult caregivers who provide support for people with dementia living in the community ( non-institutional care ) .  Types of interventions Interventions design ed to support  caregivers  in their role such as  skills training  ,  education  to assist in caring for a  person living with dementia  and  support  groups/programs .  Interventions of formal approaches to care design  ed to support caregivers in their role , care planning , case management and specially design ated members of the healthcare team - for example dementia nurse specialist or volunteers trained in caring for someone with dementia . Types of studies This review considered any meta-analyses , systematic review s , r and omised control trials , quasi-experimental studies , cohort studies , case control studies and observational studies without control groups that addressed the effectiveness of interventions that assist  caregivers to provide support for people living with dementia in the community .  Search strategy The search sought to identify published  studies from 2000 to 2005 through the use of electronic data bases . Only studies in English were considered for inclusion .  The initial search was conducted of the data bases , CINAHL , MEDLINE and PsychINFO using search strategies adapted from the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group . A second more extensive search was then conducted using the appropriate Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) and keywords for other available data bases . Finally , h and search ing of reference lists of articles retrieved and of core dementia , geriatric and psycho geriatric journals was undertaken . Assessment of  quality Method ological quality  of each of the articles was assessed by two independent review ers using appraisal checklist developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and based on the work of the Cochrane Collaboration and Centre for Review s and Dissemination . Data collection and analysis  St and ardised mean differences or weighted mean differences  and their 95 %  confidence intervals  were calculated for each included study reported in the meta- analysis . Results from comparable groups of studies were pooled in statistical meta- analysis using Review Manager Software from the Cochrane Collaboration . Heterogeneity between combined studies was tested using st and ard chi-square test . Where statistical pooling was not appropriate or possible , the findings are summarised in narrative form . Results A comprehensive search of relevant data bases , h and search ing and cross referencing found  685 articles that were assessed  for relevance to the review .  Eighty-five papers appeared to meet  the inclusion criteria based on title and abstract , and the full paper was retrieved . Of the  85 full papers review ed , 40 were accepted for inclusion  ,  three were  systematic review s , three were meta- analysis , and the remaining  34  were r  and  omised  controlled  trials . For the r and omised controlled trials that were able to be included in a meta- analysis , st and ardised mean differences or weighted mean differences and their 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for each . Results from comparable groups of studies were pooled in statistical meta- analysis using Review Manager Software and heterogeneity between combined studies was assessed by using the chi-square test . Where statistical pooling was not appropriate or possible , the findings are summarised in narrative form . The results are discussed in two main sections . Firstly it was possible to assess the effectiveness of different types of  caregiver interventions  on the outcome categories of  depression , health , subjective well-being , self-efficacy and burden .  Secondly , results are reported by main outcome category . For each of these sections , meta- analysis was conducted where it was possible ; otherwise , a narrative summary describes the findings . Effectiveness of intervention type Four categories of intervention were included in the review -  psycho-educational , support , multi-component and other . Psycho-educational  Thirteen  studies  used   psycho-educational interventions   , and all but one showed positive results across a range of outcomes .  Eight studies were entered in a meta- analysis .  No significant impact of  psycho-educational interventions  was found for the outcome categories of  subjective well-being , self-efficacy or health .  However , small but significant results were found for the categories of  depression and burden .  Support Seven studies discussed support only interventions and two of these showed significant results . These two studies were suitable for meta- analysis and demonstrated a small but significant improvement on  caregiver burden .  Multi-component Twelve of the studies report multi-component interventions and 10 of these report significant outcomes across a broad range of outcome measures including  self-efficacy , depression , subjective well-being and burden .  Unfortunately because of the heterogeneity of study design s and outcome measures , no meta- analysis was possible . Other interventions Other interventions included the use of exercise or nutrition which result ed in improvements in  psychological distress and health benefits .  Case management and a  computer aided support intervention  provided mixed results . One cognitive  behavioural therapy  study reported a reduction in  anxiety  and positive impacts  on patient behaviour .  Effectiveness of interventions using specific outcome categories In addition to analysis by type of intervention it was possible to analyse results based on some outcome categories that were used across the studies . In particular the impact of interventions on caregiver  depression  was available for meta- analysis from eight studies . This indicated that  multi-component and psycho-educational interventions  showed a small but significant positive effect on caregiver depression .  Five studies using the outcome category of  caregiver burden   were entered into a meta- analysis and findings indicated that there were no significant effects of any of interventions . No meta- analysis was possible for the outcome categories of  health , self-efficacy or subjective well-being .  Implication s for practice From this review there is evidence to support the use of well- design  ed psycho-educational or multi-component interventions  for  caregivers of people with dementia who live in the community .  Factors that appear to positively contribute to effective interventions are those which : • Provide opportunities within the intervention for the person with dementia as well as the caregiver to be involved • Encourage active participation in  educational interventions  for caregivers • Offer  individualised programs  rather than  group sessions  • Provide information on an ongoing basis , with specific information about services and coaching regarding their new role • Target the care recipient particularly by reduction in  behaviours  Factors which do not appear to have benefit in interventions are those which : • Simply refer caregivers to support groups • Only provide self help material s • Only offer peer support."
"gMore and more clinical trials have tried to assess the clinical benefit of  anti-interleukin (IL)-13 monoclonal antibodies  for  uncontrolled asthma .  The aim of this study is to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of  anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies  for  uncontrolled asthma .  Major data bases were search ed for r and omized controlled trials comparing the  anti-IL-13 treatment and a placebo  in  uncontrolled asthma .  Outcomes , including  asthma exacerbation rate , forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) , Asthma Quality of Life Question naire ( AQLQ ) scores , rescue medication use , and adverse events  were extracted from included studies for systematic review and meta- analysis .  Five studies involving 3476 patients and two  anti-IL-13 antibodies ( lebrikizumab and tralokinumab )   were included in this meta- analysis . Compared to the  placebo , anti-IL-13  treatments were associated with significant  improvement in asthma exacerbation , FEV1 and AQLQ scores , and reduction in rescue medication use . Adverse events and serious adverse events  were similar between two groups . Subgroup analysis showed  patients with high periostin level  had a lower  risk of asthma exacerbation  after receiving  anti-IL-13  treatment . Our study suggests that  anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies  could improve the  management of uncontrolled asthma .  Periostin may be a good biomarker to detect the specific subgroup who could get better response to  anti-IL-13  treatments . In view of blocking IL-13 alone is possibly not enough to achieve asthma control because of the overlapping pathophysiological roles of IL-13/IL-4 in inflammatory pathways , combined blocking of IL-13 and IL-4 with monoclonal antibodies may be more encouraging."
" There is limited evidence ( from one small trial at a high risk of bias ) on the effectiveness on Hib during pregnancy for improving maternal , neonatal and infant health outcomes . Evidence from one large high quality trial on the effectiveness of  viral influenza vaccine  during pregnancy suggests reduced RT-PCR confirmed influenza among women and their babies , suggesting the potential of this strategy for scale up but further evidence from varying context s is required . Further trials for both  Hib  and  viral influenza vaccines  with appropriate study design s and suitable comparison groups are required . There are currently two ' ongoing ' studies - these will be incorporated into the review in future up date."
"sHot  flashes ( HFs )  are a common side effect of cancer treatment . The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence related to the use of  acupuncture  for  HFs in cancer patients .  EMBASE , MEDLINE , Cochrane ( all data bases ) , PubMed , the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , and Scopus were search ed from their inception through December 2014 . Included  studies had to be r and omized controlled trials with a  usual-care  and  /or   placebo  comparison group that  investigated   acupuncture  to treat HFs in cancer patients .  No language limits were applied . The  risk of bias ( ROB )  was rated as low , high , or unclear according to Cochrane criteria . Both within-group and between-group changes were evaluated .  Four hundred two items  were identified , and  192 duplicates  were omitted ; this left  210 publications  to  be screened . Eight studies met the inclusion criteria , and all involved women with breast cancer .  All studies showed  significant within-group improvement  from the baseline for  true acupuncture ( TA )  . One study showed  significant improvement in favor of  TA  over  sham  acupuncture ( SA  ; P < .001 ) , 1 study found  in favor  of   TA   over   SA  for nighttime HFs only  ( P = .03 ) , and 1 study found in favor of  TA  over  SA  or untreated controls ( P < .01 and P < .001 , respectively ) . Between-group ( TA vs SA )  effect size ( ES ) estimates for daytime and nighttime HFs  were calculated ( ES range , 0.04 - 0.9 ) whenever possible . No studies were rated with a  low ROB  . In conclusion , the current level of evidence is insufficient to either support or refute the benefits of  acupuncture  for the management of  HFs   in cancer patients .  Future studies should provide within-group and between-group ES estimates in addition to P values."
"sPURPOSE This study aim ed to evaluate the effects of  psycho-oncologic interventions  on  emotional distress and quality of life  in  adult patients with cancer .  METHODS Literature data bases were search ed to identify r and omized controlled trials that compared a  psycho-oncologic intervention delivered face-to face with a control condition .  The main outcome measures were  emotional distress , anxiety , depression , and quality of life .  Outcomes were evaluated for three time periods : post-treatment , ≤ 6 months , and more than 6 months . We applied st and ard meta-analytic techniques to analyze both published and unpublished data from the retrieved studies . Sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were used to explore reasons for heterogeneity . RESULTS  We retrieved 198 studies ( covering 22,238 patients ) that report 218 treatment-control comparisons .  Significant  small-to-medium effects  were observed  for individual and group psychotherapy and psychoeducation .  These effects were sustained , in part , in the medium term ( ≤ 6 months ) and long term ( > 6 months ) .  Short-term effects  were evident for  relaxation training  . Studies that preselected participants according to  increased  distress produced large effects at post-treatment . A moderator effect was found for the moderator variable  "" duration of the intervention  , "" with longer interventions producing more sustained effects . Indicators of study quality were often not reported . Small- sample bias indicative of possible publication bias was found for some effects , particularly  with individual psychotherapy and relaxation training .   Various types  of psycho-oncologic interventions  are associated with significant ,  small-to-medium effects on emotional distress and quality of life  . These results should be interpreted with caution , however , because of the low quality of reporting in many of the trials."
"sWe conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to assess the effects of increasing  dietary omega-3 , omega-6 and mixed polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA )  on   musculoskeletal health , functional status , sarcopenia  and  risk of fractures  .  We search ed Medline , Embase , The Cochrane library , Clinical Trials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) data bases for R and omised Controlled Trials ( RCTs  )  of  adults evaluating the effects of higher versus  lower oral omega-3 , omega-6 or mixed PUFA  for ≥ 6 months on  musculoskeletal and functional outcomes  .  We included  28 RCTs ( 7288 participants , 31 comparisons ) ,  23 reported effects   of omega-3  , one  of omega-6   and  four  of  mixed total PUFA .  Participants and doses were heterogeneous . Six omega-3 trials were judged at low summary risk of bias . We found low- quality evidence that increasing omega-3  increased lumbar spine BMD  by 2.6 % ( 0.03 g/cm2 , 95 % CI − 0.02 to 0.07 , 463 participants ) . There was also the suggestion of an increase  in femoral neck BMD  ( of 4.1 % ) , but the evidence was of very low quality . There may be little or no effect of omega-3  on functional outcomes and bone mass ;  effects on other outcomes were unclear . Only one study reported on effects of omega-6 with very limited data . Increasing total PUFA had little or no effect  on BMD or indices of fat-free ( skeletal ) muscle mass  ( low- quality evidence ) ; no data were available  on fractures , BMD or functional status and data on bone turnover markers  were limited . Trials assessing effects of increasing omega-3 , omega-6 and total PUFA  on functional status , bone and skeletal muscle strength  are limited with data lacking or of low quality . Whilst there is an indication  that  omega-3 may  improve BMD  , high- quality RCTs are needed to confirm this and effects on  other  musculoskeletal outcomes."
"sPrevious studies have shown that , overall ,  quality of life ( QoL )  decreases within the first 3–6 months after   cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( CRS + HIPEC )   , returning to baseline levels by 6–12 months . This systematic review aims to evaluate the factors affecting QoL after  CRS + HIPEC  within 12 months of surgery . Electronic data bases were investigated search ing for articles reporting QoL with vali date d question naires up to September 2019 . Risk of bias was assessed with the method ological index for non-r and omized studies tool . The primary outcomes were short-term ( < 6 months after surgery ) and medium-term ( 6–12 months after surgery ) determinants of QoL  after CRS + HIPEC .  Secondary outcomes were  QoL and reported symptoms over time .  We included  14 studies  that used 12 different question naires . The  reported data were collected prospect ively or retrospectively for 1556 patients ( dropout < 50 % in four studies ) .  Overall , studies showed diminished  QoL  within 3 months after surgery and a recovery to baseline or greater by 12  months . QoL  was negatively influenced by higher age , female sex ,  prolonged operation time , extensive disease , residual disease , adjuvant chemotherapy , complications , stoma placement , and recurrent disease . QoL  results were comparable between studies , with dropout rates above and below 50 %  . QoL  returns to baseline levels within 12 months  after CRS + HIPEC  provided the disease does not recur , and this recovery process is influenced by several factors."
 We found no studies examining the effects of either increased or  decreased omega 6  on our primary outcome CVD  clinical endpoints  and insufficient evidence to show an effect of increased or decreased  omega 6  intake on  CVD risk factors  such as  blood lipids and blood pressure .  Very few trials were identified with a  relatively small number of participants r and omised .  There is a need for larger well conducted RCTs assessing  cardiovascular events  as well as  cardiovascular risk  factors.
"dObjective . To systematic ally review the international literature for mathematical equations used to predict  effective pressures  for  positive airway pressure ( PAP ) devices .  Methods . Google Scholar , PubMed , Scopus , Embase , Web of Science , CINAHL , and The Cochrane Library were search ed through June 27 , 2015 . The PRISMA statement was followed . There was no language limitation . Results .  709 articles were screened , fifty were downloaded  , and  twenty-six studies  presented equations that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria . In total , there were  4,436 patients in the  development  phases  and  3,489 patients  in the validation phases . Studies performed  multiple linear  regressions  analyses  as part of the equation(s ) development and included the following variables :  physical characteristics , polysomnography data , behavioral characteristics , and miscellaneous characteristics  , which were all predictive to a variable extent . Of the published variables ,  body mass index ( BMI ) and mean oxygen saturation  are the most heavily weighted , while  BMI  ( eighteen studies ) ,  apnea-hypopnea index  ( seventeen studies ) , and  neck circumference  ( eleven studies ) were the variables most frequently used in the mathematical equations .  Ten studies were from Asian countries and sixteen were from non-Asian countries .  Conclusion . This systematic review identified twenty-six unique studies reporting mathematical equations which are summarized .  Overall , BMI and mean oxygen saturation  are the most heavily weighted."
" Interventions in pregnancy to manage weight result in a significant  reduction in weight gain  in pregnancy ( evidence quality was moderate ) .  Dietary interventions  are the most effective type of intervention in pregnancy in reducing  gestational weight gain  and the  risks of pre-eclampsia , gestational hypertension and shoulder dystocia .  There is no evidence of harm as a result of the  dietary and physical activity-based interventions  in pregnancy . Individual patient data meta- analysis is needed to provide robust evidence on the differential effect of intervention in various groups based on BMI , age , parity , socioeconomic status and medical conditions in pregnancy."
" There has been a dramatic decrease in the incidence of  invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b infections  observed in the post-vaccination era in  people with sickle cell disease living in high-income countries  . Therefore , despite the absence of evidence from r and omised controlled trials , it is expected that  Haemophilus  influenzae type b conjugate vaccines may be useful in  children affected with sickle cell disease  , especially in  African countries  where there is a high prevalence of the disease . The implementation of childhood immunisation schedules , including  universal Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccination  , may substantially improve the survival of  children with sickle cell disease living in low-income countries  . We currently lack data to evaluate the potential effect of  Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination  among  unvaccinated adults with sickle cell disease .  Further research should assess the optimal Hib immunisation schedule in children and adults with sickle cell disease."
"rAbstract  Hyaluronate acid ( HA ) injections  are gaining attention as a treatment option to manage symptoms of temporom and ibular joint (  TMJ ) disorders  , but up date d evidence -based data on their effectiveness are actually lacking . The present paper aims to summarize and review systematic ally the clinical studies on the use of  hyaluronic acid injections  to treat  TMJ disorders  performed over the last decade . On November 9 , 2009 , a systematic search in the National Library of Medicine ’s PubMed ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed ) data base was performed by means of a combined MeSH and word terms to identify  all peer- review ed papers published in the English literature dealing with the  hyaluronic acid  infiltration in patients affected by TMJ disorders .  The selected papers were assessed according to a structured reading of articles format , which provided that the study design was method ologically evaluated in relation to four main issues , viz . , population , intervention , comparison , and outcome .  Nineteen ( N=19 ) papers were selected for inclusion in the review  ,  twelve ( N=12 )  dealt with the use of   hylauronic  acid  in  TMJ disk  displacements and seven  ( N=7 )  dealt with  inflammatory-degenerative disorders .  Only nine groups of research ers were involved in the studies , and less than half of the studies ( 8/19 ) were r and omized and controlled trials ( RCTs ) . All studies reported a  decrease in pain levels  independently by the patients ’ disorder and by the adopted injection protocol . Positive outcomes were maintained over the follow-up period , which was varied among studies , ranging between 15 days and 24 months . The  superiority of  HA injections   was shown only against  placebo saline injections  , but outcomes are comparable with those achieved with   corticosteroid  injections  or  oral appliances .  The available literature seems to be inconclusive as to the  effectiveness of  HA injections   with respect to other therapeutic modalities in treating TMJ disorders . Studies with a better method ological design are needed to gain better insight into this issue and to draw clinical ly useful information on the most suitable protocol s for each different TMJ disorder."
"aAn influential review in 2010 concluded that  non-pharmacological multi-component interventions  have positive effects on  cognitive functioning , activities of daily living , behaviour and mood  of  people with dementia .  Our aim here is to provide an up-to- date overview of research into psychosocial interventions and their impact on  psychosocial outcomes .  We focused on r and omised controlled trials , controlled studies and review s published  between October 2008 and August 2015  , since the earlier review . The search of PsychInfo , Medline and the Cochrane data base of systematic review s yielded  61 relevant articles  , organised into four themes echoing key phases of the care pathway : Living at home with dementia ( five review s , eight studies ) , carer interventions ( three review s , four studies ) , interventions in residential care ( 16 review s , 12 studies ) and end-of-life care ( three review s , two studies ) , along with an additional group spanning community and institutional setting s ( six review s , two studies ) . Community findings suggested that appointment of dementia specialists and attention to case management can produce positive  outcomes ;   physical therapies , cognitive training  and  modified cognitive behaviour therapy  also had a range of benefits . There was more limited evidence of positive benefits for people with dementia through interventions with family carers . Thirty-two articles focused on the management of ‘  behavioural symptoms  ’ through a range of interventions all of which had some evidence of benefit . Also a range of multi-component and specific interventions had benefits for  cognitive , emotional and behavioural well-being  of  people with dementia in residential setting  s , as well as for  quality of life .  Overall , interventions tended to be short term with impact only measured in the short term . We recommend further research on interventions to promote living well in the community post-diagnosis and to address end-of-life care . Development of psychosocial interventions would benefit from moving beyond the focus on control of behaviours to focus on wider aspects of life for people with dementia."
">Abstract Purpose  Glucagon-like peptides receptor agonists  are currently approved as anti-obesity agents , yet the experience with their use in  polycystic ovarian syndromes (PCOS)-related  obesity and insulin resistance is still limited . Methods We examined the effects of  liraglutide  on  obesity , insulin resistance , and and rogen levels  in PCOS through a meta- analysis . Results  Seven RCTs where women with PCOS were treated with   liraglutide  were identified . The variables that were examined before and after a 90-day treatment  included waist circumference , body mass index ( BMI ) , fasting insulin concentrations , insulin resistance using homeostatic model ( HOMA-IR ) , serum testosterone , and sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG )  .  The analysis included 178 women . Only 172 patients had post-treatment measurements .   While BMI  significantly dropped by −1.65 ( 0.72–2.58 ) Kg/m2 after 3 months treatment  with  liraglutide , waist circumference did not change significantly .  Similarly , fasting insulin levels , insulin sensitivity , and SHBG  did not change significantly .  However , serum testosterone  decreased by 0.29 nmol/L in 88 women ( P = 0.0003 ) . Conclusion In a limited number of the  women with PCOS   , BMI and serum testosterone  are only variables that significantly decrease after 3 months of treatment with  GLP-1 receptor agonists  . Larger sample size studies with longer duration s of treatment may be required to examine potential benefits of these medications in  improving insulin sensitivity ."

"sBackground A number of studies have reported on the effects of  iron supplementation  in  low birth weight infants ;  however , no systematic review of the available evidence has been conducted to date . Hence , we performed a systematic review of the literature to examine the effects of  iron supplementation  on  hematologic iron status , growth , neurodevelopment ,  and  adverse effects  in  low birth  weight/premature  infants .  Methods We search ed the Cochrane Library , Medline , and PubMed for articles reporting on the  effects of  iron supplementation  in low weight infants .  The following search terms were used : “  preterm born infant(s)/children ” ; “ preterm infants ” ; “ prematurely born children ” “ weight less than 1500 g at birth ” ; “ born prematurely ” ; “ low birth weight infant(s ) ”  ;  “ infants born preterm ” ; “ prematurity ”  ; “  small-for-gestational age  ” ; “  very small gestational age infants  ” ; “  iron supplementation ” ; “ iron intake ” ; “ iron supplements ” ; “ ferric and /or ferrous compounds ” ;  and  “ ferrous sulphate/fumarate/sulfate ” .  Results A  total of 15 studies were identified and included in the  systematic review .  Supplemental iron  was given orally or as an  iron-fortified formula  in 14/15 studies . The duration of treatment ranged from 1 week to 18 months .  Iron supplementation  significantly increased  hematologic measures of iron status ( including hemoglobin , hematocrit , serum ferritin )  relative to placebo or over time in most studies . All controlled studies that examined iron-deficiency anemia (IDA)/ID reported a decreased prevalence of  IDA/ID  with iron supplementation . Dose dependent decreases in the prevalence of  IDA/ID  were reported in several studies . Of the 5 studies reporting on growth , none found any significant effect on  growth-related parameters ( length , height , weight , and head circumference )  . Only 2 studies reported on  neurodevelopment ;  no marked effects were reported . There were no consistently reported  adverse  effects , including  oxidative stress , inhibited nutrient absorption , morbidity , or the requirement for blood transfusion .  Conclusion The available data suggest that  iron  supplementation increases the levels of  hematologic indicators of iron status  and reduces the prevalence of IDA/ID in  low birth weight/premature infants  . There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive statement regarding the effects of  iron supplementation  on  growth , neurodevelopment  , or the  occurrence of adverse effects  in low birth weight/premature infants."
"  Aclidinium  is associated with improved  quality of life  and reduced  hospitalisations due to severe exacerbations  in  patients with moderate to severe stable COPD  compared to  placebo .  Overall ,  aclidinium  did not significantly reduce  mortality , serious adverse events  or exacerbations requiring oral steroids or antibiotics , or both . Currently , the available data are insufficient and of very low quality in comparisons of the efficacy of  aclidinium  versus  tiotropium .  The  efficacy  of  aclidinium  versus  LABAs  can not be assessed due to inaccurate data . Thus additional trials are recommended to assess the  efficacy and safety  of  aclidinium  compared to other LAMAs or LABAs."
" The evidence for a 14 % relative reduction in preterm birth for  zinc  compared with  placebo  was primarily represented by trials involving  women of low income  and this has some relevance in areas of high perinatal mortality . There was no convincing evidence that  zinc  supplementation during pregnancy results in other useful and important benefits . Since the preterm association could well reflect poor nutrition , studies to address ways of improving the overall nutritional status of population s in impoverished areas , rather than focusing on  micronutrient  and or zinc supplementation in isolation , should be an urgent priority."
" based on systematic review s and meta-analyses of published trials to date vary . Research into the effects of n-3  PUFAs  on  depressed mood  is limited . Furthermore , results from such have led to conflicting conclusions regarding the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs in affecting reduction in  symptoms of depression .   PUFAs  are generally  well tolerated  by  adults and children  although  mild gastrointestinal effects  are reported . There is mounting evidence to suggest that n-3  PUFAs  play a role in depression and deserve greater research efforts."
 The implementation of SC in clinical trials in this systematic review is highly variable . The vast majority of the studies did not meet the WHO guidelines on SC because  palliative care therapies  were not recommended or integrated into care . Future clinical trials utilizing a SC intervention arm should define these interventions in a st and ardized approach that meets current guidelines such as the WHO recommendations.
"sMajor  depressive disorder ( MDD )  is a prevalent condition associated with significant burden in terms of reduced quality  of life  , lower productivity , increased prevalence of other conditions and increased health care costs . We conducted a systematic review and qualitative summary of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that assessed the effectiveness and safety of  acupuncture  for the treatment of  MDD .  We search ed the data bases PubMed , CINAHL , PsycINFO , Web of Science , Embase , CDSR , CENTRAL , clinical trials.gov , DARE , and PILOTS for  English- language RCTs  published through January 2015 . Two independent review ers screened the identified literature against inclusion and exclusion criteria , abstract ed study level data , and assessed the risk of bias and method ological quality of included studies . The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE .  Eighteen studies met  inclusion criteria .  Eleven  assessed  acupuncture  as monotherapy , seven as  adjunct depression treatment .  Intervention approaches and comparators varied . Evidence on the  effectiveness  and  comparative effectiveness  of  acupuncture  to treat MDD for the  outcomes depression improvement , measured as scale score differences and the number of responders  , is very weak .  Acupuncture  may be  superior to waitlist  ( low quality of evidence ) but findings for effect estimates compared to other comparators are inconclusive . Few studies reported on patients  achieving remission .  The effect of  acupuncture  on  relapse rates  could not be determined . Too few studies assessed  quality of life  to estimate treatment effects . Reported  adverse  events were typically mild in nature , but the assessment lacked rigor and studies were not design ed to detect rare events."
" This meta- analysis showed that the positive effects of the design ated techniques are probably short-lived with a question able impact on the long-term clinical outcome of the treated patients . Based on the available data , it might be impossible to advise an optimal or best- evidence strategy of lung preservation during CPB."
" and Relevance In this systematic review and meta- analysis , the use  of LAMA  compared with  placebo  as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids was associated with a lower  risk of asthma exacerbations ;  however , the association of LAMA with benefit may not be greater than that with LABA . Triple therapy was not associated with a lower risk of exacerbations."
"yObjective : To systematic ally examine the research literature on the effectiveness of  constraint-induced movement therapy  on improving  arm function  in  children with cerebral palsy  , and to assess the association between the study effect size and the characteristics of the patients and intervention protocol . Data sources : A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed , PsycINFO , Cochrane , CINAHL , Web of Science , and TRIP Data base up to May 2014 . Review methods : Studies employing r and omized controlled trial  design , children with cerebral palsy  , comparing  constraint-induced movement therapy  with another intervention with a focus on arm function , and upper-extremity measures were included in this review . Method ological quality was evaluated using the Physiotherapy Evidence -based Data base ( PEDro ) scale . Results : The literature search result ed in 27 r and omized controlled trial studies with good method ological quality that compared  constraint-induced movement therapy  with other  intervention  therapy . Overall ,  constraint-induced movement therapy  provided a  medium beneficial effect  ( d = 0.546 ; p < 0.001 ) when compared with  conventional therapy .  For the subgroup analyses , presence of a dose-equivalent comparison group ,  intervention location  ,  and time of follow-up  were significant factors . Studies examining  constraint-induced movement therapy  effect without a dose-equivalent comparison group showed a  large effect  in  children with cerebral palsy  , but studies with a dose-equivalent group only showed a  small effect  .  Children  who received  home-based constraint-induced movement therapy  had a  better improvement in arm function  than those who  received constraint-induced movement therapy  elsewhere . Conclusion : The research literature supports  constraint-induced movement therapy  as an  effective  intervention to  improve arm function  in children with cerebral palsy."
"aBACKGROUND  Chronic pain  is one of the most frequent disease symptoms and represents a global health problem with a considerable economic burden . The role of  polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA )  in chronic pain conditions was debated during the last decade with conflicting results . OBJECTIVE To assess whether  polyunsaturated fatty acids intake  is useful as a preventive or curative tool in chronic pain . STUDY DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis . SETTING This study examined all published studies , either preventive or curative , on  PUFA supplementation  and chronic pain . METHODS We retrieved  studies published in any language by search ing systematic ally Medline , Embase , Conference Proceedings Citation Index , dissertations data bases , and the 5 regional bibliographic data bases of the World Health Organization until May 2015 .  We included both observational and intervention studies reporting effect measures and their confidence intervals of  polyunsaturated fatty acids intake  in the regular diet or supplementation and pain . Two investigators selected studies ; extracted data independently on baseline characteristics , exposure , and outcomes ; and rated the quality of interventional studies using Jadad score . We calculated  pooled st and ardized mean differences ( SMDs ) of pain indexes such as the Visual Analogue Score .  We further carried out subgroup analyses by disease , type of  PUFA  , outcome scale , quality index , dose , and time of supplementation . RESULTS We retrieved  5 observational and 46 intervention studies .  Only one observational study showed a protective effect of  PUFA .  On the contrary , the interventional studies yielded a  pooled r and om effects SMD  of -0.40 ( 95 % CI -0.58 , -0.22 ) , which indicates improvement , as 0 is the value that indicates absence of effect . The largest effect was found for dysmenorrhea ( SMD -0.82 , 95 % CI -1.21 , -0.43 ) , Ω-3  supplementation  ( -0.47 , 95 % CI -0.68 , -0.26 ) and composite scores ( -0.58 , 95 % CI -1.07 ,  -0.09 ) . Mitigation of  pain was stronger for low doses ( -0.55 , 95 % CI -0.79 , -0.30 ) and short supplementation periods ( -0.56 , 95 % CI -0.86 , -0.25 ) . LIMITATIONS While the number of curative studies was large , that of preventive studies available was limited .  Our results suggest that  Ω-3 PUFA supplementation  moderately  improves chronic pain  , mainly that due to dysmenorrhea . Further investigation on the preventive potential of  PUFA supplementation  is needed , as the amount of evidence is scarce . Key words : Meta- analysis , systematic review , chronic pain ,  PUFA , supplementation , Ω-3  , dysmenorrhea."
"nBACKGROUND Identifying an immunological correlate of protection for  rotavirus vaccines ( Rotarix [ RV1 ]  and  RotaTeq [ RV5 ] )  would substantially facilitate testing of interventions for improving efficacy in developing countries and evaluating additional c and i date rotavirus vaccines . METHODS We accessed PubMed and Clinical Trials.gov to identify immunogenicity and efficacy trials for  RV1 and RV5  to correlate anti-rotavirus serum immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) antibody titers vs efficacy in  regions stratified by all-cause under-5 mortality rates ( u5MR )  . We established a cutoff point for IgA geometric mean concentration or titer ( GMC ) that predicted lower  efficacy  and calculated pooled  vaccine efficacy  among countries with high vs low IgA titers . FINDINGS We observed an inverse correlation between  u5MR  and  IgA titers  for RV1 ( r(2 ) = 0.72 ; P < .001 and RV5 ( r(2 ) = 0.66 ; P < .001 ) and between  efficacy and IgA titers  for both vaccines ( r(2 ) = 0.56 ; P = .005 ) .  Postimmunization anti-rotavirus IgA GMC  < 90 were associated with decline in  vaccine efficacy . Efficacy during first 2 years of life  was significantly lower among countries with IgA GMC < 90 ( 44 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 30 - 55 ) compared to countries with GMC > 90 ( 85 % ; 95 % CI , 82 - 88 ) . INTERPRETATION We observed a significant correlation between IgA  titers  and  rotavirus vaccine efficacy  and hypothesize that a critical level of  IgA antibody titer  is associated with a sufficient level of sustained protection after rotavirus vaccination."

 Individual r and omized trials suggest that music intervention is accepted by patients and associated with improved  psychological outcomes .  The effects of music on vital signs especially  blood pressure  are small . High- quality trials are needed to further determine the effects of music intervention.
" 19 RCTs and eight observational studies evaluated issues related to the current objectives . CHC represent an  effective and safe  treatment in women with any PCOS phenotype . In HA/PCOS patients , any CHC analyzed in this review can be used for  symptom relief .  For  patients with metabolic risk , overweight or moderate IR  that does  not require metformin  , a vaginal contraceptive ring appears to be preferred to oral  EE/DRP .  In these patients , the  combination of CHC and myo-inositol  may be  more effective in controlling endocrine and metabolic profiles .  However , further research is needed to define the optimal duration and to clarify the effects of treatment on  long-term metabolic outcomes .  Future research should also focus on new CHC."

"ePURPOSE OF REVIEW This article review s findings from recently published r and omized controlled trials and systematic review s to provide an up-to- date assessment of the  efficacy and safety  of  tiotropium  , the only currently available long-acting muscarinic antagonist , when used alone or in conjunction with other respiratory medications in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . RECENT FINDINGS Results of recent clinical trials support findings from earlier trials in  patients with moderate to very severe COPD  demonstrating significant benefits of  tiotropium  compared to  placebo  , including sustained  increases in lung function , reductions in exacerbations and risk of exacerbation-related hospitalizations , and improvement in health status .  These benefits were particularly noted in the 4-year UPLIFT  study that included 5993 COPD patients , including a large percentage with moderate severity .  Whereas the  cardiovascular safety  of  tiotropium  has been question ed , results of the UPLIFT trial and a recent pooled analysis of data from 30 trials of  tiotropium  demonstrated that  tiotropium  is associated with reductions in  the risk of all-cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events .  SUMMARY Recent findings confirm the benefits of  tiotropium  in COPD management and provide reassurance regarding its  safety .  Moreover , the recent UPLIFT trial provides supportive evidence for the  efficacy  of  tiotropium  in  COPD patients already receiving treatment with long-acting inhaled beta-agonists and inhaled  corticosteroids , suggesting advantages of ' triple ' therapy in advanced disease . Further , well design ed , adequately powered studies should explore the potential advantages and disadvantages of various combinations of currently available long-acting respiratory medications in COPD , particularly in different clinical phenotypes of this heterogeneous disease."

"yBackground Overweight and obesity pose a big challenge to pregnancy as they are associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcome . Evidence of lifestyle intervention result ing in improved pregnancy outcome is conflicting . Hence the objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of  antenatal dietary , activity , behaviour or lifestyle interventions  in  overweight and obese pregnant women  to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes . Methods A systematic review and meta-analyses of r and omised and non-r and omised clinical trials following prior registration ( CRD420111122 http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ PROSPERO ) and PRISMA guidelines was employed . A search of the Cochrane Library , EMBASE , MEDLINE , CINAHL , Maternity  and  Infant care and  eight other data bases for studies published prior to January  2012 was undertaken . Electronic literature search es , study selection , methodology and quality appraisal were performed independently by two authors . Method ological quality of the studies was assessed according to Cochrane risk of bias tool . All appropriate r and omised and non-r and omised clinical trials were included while exclusions consisted of  interventions in pregnant women who were not overweight or obese , had pre-existing diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome ,  and  systematic review  s. Maternal outcome measures , including  maternal gestational weight gain , gestational diabetes and Caesarean section  , were documented . Fetal outcomes , including  large for gestational age and macrosomia ( birth weight > 4 kg  ) , were also documented . Results  Thirteen r and omised and six non-r and omised clinical trials  were identified and included in the meta- analysis . The evidence suggests  antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention  in  obese pregnant women  reduces  maternal pregnancy weight gain  ( 10 r and omised clinical trials ; n = 1228 ; -2.21 kg ( 95 % confidence interval -2.86 kg to -1.59 kg ) ) and a trend towards a reduction in the prevalence of  gestational diabetes  ( six r and omised clinical trials ; n = 1,011 ; odds ratio 0.80 ( 95 % confidence interval 0.58 to 1.10 ) ) . There were no clear differences reported for other outcomes such as  Caesarean delivery , large for gestational age , birth weight or macrosomia .  All available studies were assessed to be of low to medium quality . Conclusion  Antenatal lifestyle intervention  is associated with  restricted gestational weight gain  and a trend towards a reduced prevalence of  gestational diabetes  in  the overweight and obese population .  These findings need to be interpreted with caution as the available studies were of poor to medium quality."
" In  children with persistent asthma  , the addition of LABA to ICS was not associated with a significant  reduction  in  the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids  , but it was superior for  improving lung function  compared with the same or higher doses of ICS . No differences in  adverse effects  were apparent , with the exception of greater  growth  with the use of ICS and LABA compared with a higher ICS dose . The trend towards increased  risk of hospital admission  with LABA , irrespective of the dose of ICS , is a matter of concern and requires further monitoring."
" In the field of physical activity interventions ,  fidelity measurement  is highly heterogeneous both conceptually and method ologically .

Recommendations are provided on how this situation can be improved."
"nUndernutrition is commonly associated with  chronic disease in children and the elderly .  Overnutrition is also , but less commonly , associated with chronic illness . In most diseases malnutrition arises because energy intake does not match energy output . Traditionally , the focus of research has been on abnormalities in energy expenditure , in the belief that these factors were the main determinants of energy imbalance . Recent studies using the  doubly-labelled-water method  to measure  total energy expenditure  , combined with more complex study design , have suggested an alternative conclusion . In many chronic diseases patient behaviour , and particularly energy intake , is responsible for energy imbalance and malnutrition . Energy balance studies have therefore provided a useful foundation for the design of strategies aim ed at preventing or managing chronic malnutrition . However , modifying patient behaviour is an ambitious undertaking which may not be within the scope of existing clinical nutrition services . A number of non-traditional models of managing  chronic malnutrition in children and the elderly  are promising . Increasing recognition of the value of systematic review will also provide improved strategies for prevention and management of chronic malnutrition."
" This review found a significant decrease in  length of stay  in  preterm infants receiving a  NNS  intervention .  The review did not reveal a consistent benefit of NNS with respect to other major clinical variables  ( weight gain , energy intake , heart rate , oxygen saturation , intestinal transit time , and age at full oral feeds )  . The review identified other positive clinical outcomes of NNS : transition from tube to bottle feeds and behavior . No negative outcomes were reported in any of the studies . There were also a number of limitations of the presently available evidence related to the design of the studies , outcome variability , and lack of long-term data . Based on the available evidence , NNS in  preterm  infants would appear to have some clinical benefit . It does not appear to have any short-term negative effects . In view of the fact that there are no long-term data , further investigations are recommended . In order to facilitate meta- analysis of these data , future research in this area should involve outcome."

"sIL-17 has a role in inflammation in RA , and its levels in joints correlate with disease severity . Multiple RCTs have been performed to study effects of  anti-IL-17 agents .  The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta- analysis to analyze the  efficacy and safety  of   anti-IL-17  agents  in the management of RA . This work is based on a systematic review of studies retrieved by a sensitive search strategy in PubMed , EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 9/7/15 . Study selection criteria were the following :  adult patients ( age ≥ 18 years ) with RAs , r and om selection of patients  for anti-IL-17 therapy  and  treatment response compared  to placebo .  We performed systematic literature review per PRISMA guideline and two investigators independently selected  seven r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs )  for meta- analysis . We used r and om effect model calculating  odds ratio  (  OR  ) and 95 %  confidence interval  ( CI ) to measure the  efficacy  with  ACR20/50/70  responses and the safety with  adverse  events .  Seven studies with total of 1226 patients including 905 in  anti-IL-17  group and 321 in  placebo  were included  in the meta- analysis .  Anti-IL-17  was  effective  in  achieving ACR20 and ACR50  compared to placebo ( OR 2.47 , 95 % CI 1.29–4.72 , P = 0.006 , I2 77 % and OR 2.94 , 95 % CI 1.37–6.28 , P = 0.005 , I2 64 % , respectively ) . Data analysis for ACR70 showed a favorable trend   toward  anti-IL-17  ( OR 2.62 , 95 % CI 1–6.89 , P = 0.05 , I2 15 % ) . Subgroup analysis of ACR20 for individual anti-IL-17 agents showed that ixekizumab was more effective than placebo , while secukinumab showed a trend toward achieving  the ACR20 response  . However , brodalumab was  not effective  compared to  placebo  . Safety analysis did not  show increased risk of any or serious adverse effects   by anti-IL-17  compared to placebo ( OR 1.23 , 95 % CI 0.94–1.61 , P = 0.13 , I2 = 0 % and OR 1.28 , 95 % CI 0.57–2.88 , P = 0.55 , I2 = 0 % , respectively ) . This meta- analysis concludes that anti-IL-17 is effective in the treatment of RA  without increased risk of any or serious adverse effects ;  however , the results are limited by significant heterogeneity and small duration of studies."
"yObjective : An important aspect of malnutrition is deficiency of different micronutrients during pregnancy or early childhood . We systematic ally review ed the role of nutrition in  child growth  ( weight or height gain ) and  development  . Methods : A comprehensive literature search was done on PubMed /Cochrane Library browsing through  38,795 abstract s until December 31 , 2016  to select systematic review s/meta-analyses and individual r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of  micronutrient supplementation .  Results : Micronutrients studied included  iron , iodine , folate , zinc , calcium , magnesium , selenium , vitamin D , vitamin A , vitamin B complex , and multiple micronutrients .  We summarize evidence with details and results of RCTs , highlight strengths/weaknesses , and critically interpret findings .  Effects of breastfeeding-promotion , food-supplementation ( complementary and school feeding ) , conditional-cash-transfers , and integrated nutrition/psychosocial interventions  are discussed . Conclusion : Based on this evidence we make policy and programmatic recommendations for supplementation to mothers and children at high-risk of deficiency."
"sBackground Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is the most popular endocrine disorder in reproductive age with unknown etiology and many comorbidities . This systematic review focused on the effectiveness of  calcium and vitamin D ( Ca/ Vit . D ) supplementation  on  metabolic factors  ,  menstrual cycles  , and follicular  responses  in  PCOS patients .  Methods Relevant studies were identified from the following electronic data bases including Pub Med , Web of Science , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , The Cochrane Library , issue Oct. 2018 , Evidence Based Medicine Review s ( EBMR ) , Google Scholar , EMBASE , as well as Farsi data bases including Magiran and SID from 2000 to 2018 . Out of  449 articles , six clinical trials  met the inclusion criteria . Results Out of six studies included in the study , only three studies had sufficient data for meta- analysis . Overall , studies showed that  prescribing Ca/ Vit . D supplementation  with metformin  improved menstrual regularity and follicular maturation  and  significant decreases in serum insulin levels , homeostasis model of assessment -insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) and fasting blood sugar ( FBS ) and also significant rises on quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( QUICKI )  at two  studies  .  Hirsutism and level of testosterone  decreased significantly after  adding Ca/ Vit . D to  metformin in two different studies . Based on two different trials ,  co-supplementation of Ca/ Vit . D  had a significant impact to  decrease serum triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol levels as well as levels of cholesterol and LDL .  Conclusion It is possible  that calcium and vitamin D supplementation  improve  menstrual disturbances and metabolic factors  in  PCOS  in a long-term period , but further trials are still needed to confirm these findings."

" This systematic review , reporting meta-analysed data from studies of  pregnant women with chronic hypertension  , shows that adverse outcomes of pregnancy are common and emphasises a need for heightened antenatal surveillance . A consistent strategy to study  women with chronic hypertension  is needed , as previous study design s have been diverse . These findings should inform counselling and contribute to optimisation of maternal health , drug treatment , and pre-pregnancy management in women affected by chronic hypertension."
"eFollowing the discovery of Mirror Neuron System ( MNS )  , Action Observation Training ( AOT )  has become an emerging rehabilitation tool to improve  motor functions  both in neurologic and orthopedic pathologies . The aim of this study is to present the state of the art on the use of  AOT  in experimental studies to improve  motor function recovery  in any disease . The research was performed in PubMed , PEDro , Embase , CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( last search July 2015 ) . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that analyse efficacy of  AOT  for recovery of motor functions , regardless of the kind of disease , were retrieved . The validity of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for evaluating risk of bias .  Twenty RCTs were eligible .  Four studies showed   AOT  efficacy  in improving  upper limb functional recovery  in  participants with chronic stroke  , two studies in sub-acute ones and one in acute ones . Six articles suggested its  effectiveness  on  walking performance  in  chronic stroke individuals  , and three of them also suggested an  efficacy  in improving  balance .  The use of  AOT  was also recommended in  individuals with Parkinson ’s disease  to improve  autonomy  in  activities of daily living  , to improve  spontaneous movement rate of self-paced finger movements  and to reduce  freezing of gait .  Other two studies also indicated that  AOT   improves upper limb motor function  in   children with cerebral palsy  .  The last two studies , showed the  efficacy of  AOT   in  improving motor recovery  in postsurgical orthopedic participants . Overall  method ological  quality of the considered studies was medium . The majority of analyzed studies suggest the  efficacy  of  AOT  , in addition to conventional physiotherapy , to improve  motor function recovery  in individuals with neurological and orthopedic diseases . However , the application of  AOT  is very heterogeneous in terms of diseases and outcome measures assessed , which makes it difficult to reach , to date , any conclusion that might influence clinical practice."
"dChildren are susceptible to a variety of respiratory infections . Wheezing is a common sign presented by  children with respiratory infections .  Asthma , bronchiolitis , and bronchitis are common causes of  childhood wheezing disease ( CWD )  and are regarded as overlapping disease spectra .  Macrolides  are common antimicrobial agents with anti-inflammatory effects . We conducted a comprehensive literature search and a systematic review of studies that investigated the influences of  macrolide treatment  on  CWD .  The primary outcomes were the  impact of  macrolides  on hospitalization courses of  patients with CWD .   Data pertaining to the  study population ,  macrolide  treatment , hospital courses  ,  and recurrences  were analyzed .  Twenty-three studies with a combined study population of 2210 patients were included in the systematic review .  Any kind of benefit from  macrolide  treatment was observed in approximately two-thirds of the studies ( 15/23 ) . Eight studies were included in the meta- analysis to investigate the influence of  macrolides  on the  length of stay ( LOS ) , duration of oxygen dem and ( DOD ) , symptoms and signs of respiratory distress , and re-admission rates .  Although the benefits of  macrolide  treatment were reported in several of the studies , no significant differences in  LOS , DOD , symptoms and signs of respiratory distress , or re-admission rates  were observed in patients undergoing  macrolide  treatment . In conclusion , any kind of benefit of   macrolide treatment   was observed in approximately two-thirds of the studies ; however , no obvious benefits of  macrolide  treatment were observed in the hospitalization courses of  children with CWD  . The routine use of  macrolides  to improve the hospitalization course of  children with CWD  is not suggested."
" Offering  personally tailored activities  to  people with dementia in long-term care  may slightly improve  challenging behaviour .  Evidence from one study suggested that it was probably associated with a slight reduction in the  quality of life  rated by proxies , but may have little or no effect on  self-rated quality of life .  We acknowledge concerns about the validity of proxy ratings of  quality of life  in severe dementia . Personally tailored activities may have little or no effect on  negative affect  and we are uncertain whether they improve  positive affect  or  mood .  There was no evidence that interventions were more likely to be effective if based on one specific theoretical model rather than another . Our findings leave us unable to make recommendations about specific activities or the frequency and duration of delivery . Further research should focus on methods for selecting appropriate and meaningful activities for people in different stages of  dementia ."
"eFamily  carers of people who have long term illness  often experience  physical and mental health  morbidities , and burden . While there is good evidence to suggest that carers benefit from  psychosocial interventions  , these have primarily been delivered via face-to-face individual or group-formats .  eHealth interventions  offer a novel , accessible and self-paced approach to care delivery . Whether these are effective for carers ' wellbeing has been little explored . This paper reports the first comprehensive systematic review in this area .  A total of 78 studies , describing 62 discrete interventions , were identified .  Interventions commonly aim ed to promote  carers ' knowledge , self-efficacy , caregiving appraisal  , and  reduce global health morbidities .  Interventions were offered to  carers of people with a wide range of long term illness ;  dementia has been the most research ed area , as reported in 40 % of studies . Clinical and method ological heterogeneity in interventions precluded meta-analyses , and so data were analysed narratively . The most popular approach has comprised  psychoeducational interventions  delivered via an enriched online environment with supplementary modes of communication , such as network support with professionals and peers . Overall ,  carers  appreciate the flexibility and self-paced nature of eHealth interventions , with high rates of  satisfaction and acceptability .  More studies using robust design s are needed to extend the evidence base."
"sOBJECTIVE This review examined the impact of   Therapeutic Patient Education ( TPE ) programs  in hemodialysis  and the assessment of these programs . REVIEW METHODS AND DATA SOURCES : A systematic review was performed . Bibliographical research was done with a data base in the social and human sciences ( PsychINFO , PsycARTICLES , SocINDEX with Full Text and the Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection ) . References were also search ed in several review s specialized in  nephrology-dialysis and in patient education .  Articles were classified according three different outcomes : ( 1 ) physiological outcomes , ( 2 ) psychosocial outcomes , ( 3 ) or combined criteria . RESULTS  35 articles were selected .  The majority dealt with purely physiological outcomes ( 18 ) and the minority concerned only psychosocial outcomes ( 4 ) . Fifteen articles discussed both  physiological  and  psychosocial  outcomes , i.e. combined criteria . Beneficial effects were shown such as improvements in  knowledge , adherence and quality of life .  Most educational interventions were performed by nurses .  This systematic review found that  educational programs  in  dialysis  have become more numerous and efficient , with a prevalence of assessment based on physiological outcomes .  TPE  is a global management method based on both the physiological and the psychological well-being of the patient . Studies that take into account both physiological and psychosocial variables are very useful for underst and ing the effects of  TPE  programs on  dialysis patients .  The review shows that nurses play an important role in  TPE  and that they require varied communicational , educational , animation and assessment skills . These positive effects are encouraging for nurses to stimulate the development of  TPE  programs for  dialysis patients  in their multidisciplinary teams . The nurse 's role is important for the commitment of each health caregiver ( nurse , physician , dietician , pharmacist , psychologist , etc . ) for the global management of patients in the  TPE  process."

DATA SOURCES Comprehensive search es were conducted using the following electronic data bases from inception to May 2010 : HUGEnet , SIGLE , British Library Direct , CINAHL , Medline , AMED and Web of Knowledge . Bibliographies of all studies and systematic review s were search ed by h and . STUDY SELECTION Studies were selected based on :  self-ventilating participants with neurodegenerative conditions  ; interventions aim ed at improving respiratory function ; and any valid and reliable measures of respiratory function as outcomes . STUDY APPRAISAL Studies were appraised by one review er using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme . Data were synthesis ed using a narrative approach . RESULTS  Thirty-five studies were included in the review .  The strongest evidence was for the use  of  non-invasive ventilation   for  people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  , although this was weak . The evidence for the use of  respiratory muscle training  and methods to increase  peak cough flow  showed a positive effect , but was also weak .  There is weak evidence for the positive effects of  physiotherapeutic interventions  for respiratory problems in  people with neurodegenerative conditions .  Further work is necessary in specific neurodegenerative conditions to identify why respiratory problems occur , and larger scale studies should be undertaken to investigate management of these problems."
 Absence of prior M. tuberculosis infection or sensitization with environmental mycobacteria is associated with higher  efficacy  of  BCG  against pulmonary tuberculosis and possibly against miliary and meningeal tuberculosis . Evaluations of new tuberculosis vaccines should account for the possibility that prior infection may mask or block their effects.
" In naïve girls bivalent vaccine shows  higher efficacy  , even if the number of events detected is low . In women already infected the benefit of the vaccination seems negligible."
 The manuscript aims to solve frequent questions and help in decision-making strategies when treating patients with parenteral MTX.
"dBACKGROUND  Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome  (  OSAS  ) is a condition of obstruction , apneas and arousals while sleeping . It has been suggested that OSAS independently influences  glucose metabolism  . The main treatment for OSAS is  continuous positive airways pressure ( CPAP ) .  OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of CPAP on  insulin resistance and glucose metabolism .  SEARCH STRATEGY We search ed Medline , Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register ( January 2010 ) . SELECTION CRITERIA We included  r and omised and non-r and omised trials comparing   CPAP with inactive control or placebo CPAP   in adults with OSAS .  DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data . Parallel and crossover group trials were analysed separately . A meta- analysis was carried out . RESULTS Three parallel group and two cross-over r and omised trials and  one controlled trial  were included  investigating 296 participants . Sample sizes ranged from n=13 to n=102 participants , age was 18 to 75 years , mean body mass index ( BMI ) 27.2 kg/m² to 37.1 kg/m² ,  mean apnoe hypopnoe index ( AHI  ) 29.7 to 39.7 events per hour , mean dips >  4 % in arterial oxygen saturation per hour of sleep  1 to 42.7 events  . The studies ' method ological quality varied . Follow-up ranged from 4 to 12 weeks . Various endpoints were investigated  . CPAP  did neither  influence plasma insulin levels nor HOMA-index , adiponectin levels or HbA1c value  . One study reported a significant positive effect on  the insulin sensitivity index  ( 1.68%/min , 95 % CI 0.3 to 3.06 ) .  This systematic review does not support the hypothesis that OSAS independently  influences glucose metabolism  . Sufficiently powered , long-term r and omised controlled trials defining changes  of insulin resistance  as primary endpoint are needed."
" Behavior change theory was more commonly used to design effective interventions . Few adherence interventions have been developed using theory , representing a gap between intervention design recommendations and research practice."
 Two-stage hepatectomy is safe and effective in  selected patients with initially unresectable CLM .  Further studies are required to better define patient selection criteria for  TSH  and the exact roles of PVE and preoperative and interval chemotherapy.
" At the moment , evidence of very low to moderate quality is available on the effectiveness of  tDCS ( anodal/cathodal/dual ) versus control ( sham/any other intervention )  for improving  ADL performance  after stroke . However , there are many ongoing r and omised trials that could change the quality of evidence in the future . Future studies should particularly engage those who may benefit most from  tDCS  after stroke and in the effects of  tDCS  on upper and lower limb function , muscle strength and  cognitive abilities  ( including spatial neglect ) .  Dropouts and adverse events  should be routinely monitored and presented as secondary outcomes . They should also address method ological issues by adhering to the Consoli date d St and ards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement."
" : Of the included studies here ,  CST  appears to be the most implementation ready , improving both  cognition and quality of life  with implementation readiness effectively explored in two LMIC countries : India and Tanzania."
 There is currently only one r and omised controlled trial evaluating the effects of high versus low dose of initial  thyroid hormone replacement  for CHT . There is inadequate evidence to suggest that a high dose is more beneficial compared to a low dose initial  thyroid hormone  replacement in the treatment of CHT.
" The evidence for employer and patient safety benefits of  influenza vaccination  is not straightforward and has been interpreted differently by different systematic review authors . Future uptake of  influenza vaccination  among  healthcare workers  may benefit from a fully transparent guideline process by a panel representing all relevant stakeholders , which clearly communicates the underlying rationale , evidence base and judgements made."
" The scarcity of available studies and their heterogeneity makes it difficult to reach any firm conclusions . The review findings suggest  supplementary feeding  has a negligible impact on  child growth ;  however , the pooled results should be interpreted with great caution because the studies included in the review are clinical ly diverse . Future studies should address issues of research design , including sample size calculation , to detect meaningful clinical effects and adequate intervention allocation concealment . In the meantime ,  families  and  children in need  should be provided appropriate feeding , health care and sanitation without waiting for new RCTs to establish a research basis for feeding children."
" The  interventions , costs  , and  outcomes  were very diverse . The results emphasize the need for guidelines to increase the comparability of  cost-effectiveness  evaluations relating to asthma . Only then will it be possible to conclude whether interventions for  asthmatics  , such as  self-management based on peak flow monitoring interventions  , are cost-effective."
"RBackground and Aims We sought to analyze whether response to a second-line biologic varies depending on the reason for discontinuation of the primary  anti-TNF agent  ( primary non-response [ PNR ] , secondary loss of response [ LOR ] after initial response , or intolerance ) , through a systematic review and meta- analysis . Methods Through a systematic search  through May 31 , 2017 , we identified eight r and omized controlled trials [ RCTs ] of biologics in patients with IBD with prior exposure to anti-TNF agents  , that stratified response to second-line therapy by reason for discontinuing primary anti-TNF therapy [ PNR vs. LOR vs. intolerance ] . We estimated  relative risk [ RR ]  ( and 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) of  achieving clinical remission  in  patients with PNR  as compared with  patients with LOR , and intolerance  , through r and om effects meta- analysis . Results As compared with patients who discontinued prior anti-TNF due to intolerance , patients with prior PNR were 24 % less likely to  achieve remission  with second-line biologics ( RR,0.76 [ 0.61 - 0.96 ] ) . As compared with patients who discontinued prior anti-TNF due to LOR , patients with prior PNR were 27 % less likely to  achieve remission  with induction  therapy  with second-line biologics ( RR,0.73 [ 0.56 - 0.97 ] ) , particularly to ustekinumab ( RR,0.64 [ 0.52 - 0.80 ] ) . There was no difference in  response to  vedolizumab   in patients with prior PNR or LOR to anti-TNF agents ( RR,1.16 [ 0.85 - 1.58 ] ) . Conclusion  Patients with PNR to anti-TNF  agents are less likely to respond to second-line non-TNF biologics , as compared with patients who discontinued therapy due to secondary LOR or intolerance . This may be attributed to underlying pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TNF agents in patients with PNR."
" PRP application   improves function  from basal evaluations in  patients with knee joint cartilage degenerative pathology  and tends to be more effective  than HA  administration . Discrepancy in the degenerative severity modifies the treatment responses , leading to participants with lower degrees of degeneration benefiting more  from PRP  injections."
 The review confirmed that education alone is less effective than a combination of education and the use of personal diaries to promote daily weighing . There is some evidence to suggest that motivational interviewing has potential for use in the heart  failure population  and may be more beneficial than st and ard education . Furthermore education should be tailored to individual learning needs . Clinicians should ideally work with patients to encourage the use of tools to reinforce the importance of self-care behaviours . Tailoring interventions to suit the individual is also beneficial . Interventions that  promote efficacy in self-care behaviours through empowerment  should be investigated in future studies . Further research needs to also consider the impact of an intervention/s over an extended timeframe ( e.g. more than 12 months ) as the majority of the research focuses on short time periods ( e.g. 3 months ).
"ePURPOSE  Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 ( rhBMP-2 )  is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a viable alternative to bone graft in spinal fusion and maxillary sinus lift . The research questions for meta- analysis were : Is  rhBMP-2  an effective bone graft substitute in  localized alveolar ridge augmentation and maxillary sinus floor augmentation  ? What are the potential adverse events ? MATERIAL S AND METHODS A search of  MEDLINE from January 1980 to January 2014 using PubMed , the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review  s  and Controlled  Trials , CINAHL , and EMBASE was performed . Search es were performed from Medical Subject Headings . The quality of each study included was grade d by Review Manager software . The primary outcome variable was  bone formation  measured as change in bone height on computed tomogram . A systematic review of adverse events also was performed . A r and om-effects model was chosen . Continuous variables were calculated using the st and ardized mean difference and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) comparing improvement from baseline of the experimental group with that of the control group .  Change in bone height  was calculated using logarithmic odds ratio . Test of significance used the Z statistic with a P value of .05 . RESULTS  Ten studies  met the criteria for systematic review ;  8 studies were included  in  the meta- analysis  . Five studies assessed localized alveolar ridge augmentation and result ed in an overall st and ardized mean difference of 0.56 ( CI , 0.20 - 0.92 ) in favor of BMP ; this result was statistically important . Three studies assessed maxillary sinus floor augmentation and result ed in an  overall st  and ardized mean difference of -0.50 ( CI , -0.93 to -0.09 ) , which was meaningfully different in favor of the control group .  Adverse  events were inconsistently reported , ranging from  no complications  to  widespread adverse events .   For localized alveolar ridge augmentation , this meta- analysis showed that  rhBMP-2  substantially increases  bone height .  However ,  rhBMP-2  does not perform as well as the  autograft  or allograft in maxillary sinus floor augmentation . Long-term clinical success and adverse events need to be reported with more consistency before definitive conclusions can be made."
"sStudies in pediatric oncology have shown a positive effect of  physical activity  on  disease- and treatment-related side effects .  Although several review s have approved the benefits of  therapeutic exercise  for  adult cancer patients  , no systematic review exists summarizing the evidence of  physical activity  in  pediatric oncology  . We identified a total of  17 studies using  the  PubMed data base and Cochrane library  . To evaluate the evidence , we used the evaluation system of the Oxford Center for Evidence -Based Medicine 2001 . The findings confirm that  clinical exercise interventions  are  feasible and safe  , especially with  acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) patients and during medical treatment .  No  adverse effects  have been reported . Positive effects were found on  fatigue , strength , and quality of life .  Single studies present positive effects on  the immune system , body composition , sleep , activity levels , and various aspects of physical functioning .  Child-specific aspects such as  cognitive abilities , growth , adolescence , and reintegration into peer-groups  ,  school  , and sports have barely been taken into consideration . The evidence for  exercise interventions  in pediatric oncology is rated level “ 3 . ” Although the results are very promising , future research of high method ological quality and focusing on child-specific aspects is needed to establish evidence -based  exercise recommendations  , particularly for childhood cancer patients."
"sPURPOSE To investigate the effect of interventions that promote  upper limb ( UL ) recovery  in  stroke survivors with severe paresis .  METHODS A systematic search of the scientific literature from  January 1970 to March 2009  was conducted using CINAHL , Cochrane , PEDro , Pubmed and Web of Science . keywords used included stroke , severe , hemiplegia , UL , task-oriented ,  robot , non-robot and electrical stimulation .  Method  ological quality  of the studies was assessed using  the PEDro rating scale .  Studies were grouped into one of three intervention categories :  robotic therapy , electrical stimulation or ' other ' therapy .  RESULTS  Seventeen r and omised controlled trials  met the inclusion criteria . A ' best evidence synthesis ' indicated strong evidence that  robotic therapy  provides a  large beneficial effect  and limited evidence that electrical stimulation and ' other ' interventions provide a  large beneficial effect on function .  There is no evidence that these interventions influence use of the arm in everyday tasks .  There are a number of newly developed interventions that enable  stroke survivors with severe paresis  to actively participate in task-oriented practice to promote  UL recovery .  While these interventions offer some promise for  stroke survivors with severe paresis  , ultimately , the effectiveness of these interventions will be dependent on whether they lead to  restoration of function  to the point at which the stroke survivor can practice everyday tasks."
" Compared to regimens without antitumour antibiotics , regimens that contained these agents showed a statistically significant advantage for  tumour response and time to progression  in  women with metastatic breast cancer  but were not associated with an improvement in  overall survival .  The favourable effect on  tumour response and time to progression  observed in  anthracycline-containing  regimens was also associated with greater toxicity."
" Glaucoma content experts need to establish uniform cutoffs for these newer technologies , so that studies that compare these technologies can be interpreted more uniformly . Nevertheless , synthesized data at this time demonstrate that amongst the newest technologies , OCT has the  highest glaucoma diagnostic accuracy  followed by GDx and then HRT."
"OBackground Over the past decades , there has been an increase in overweight and obesity in  women of childbearing age  , as well as the general population . Overweight and obesity are related to a later , increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases . Increasing weight between pregnancies has a negative impact on the development of the fetus in a subsequent pregnancy . It is also related to long-term obesity and overweight for the woman . Accordingly , weight control in  women of the childbearing age  is important for both women and their offspring .  Information and communication technology ( ICT )  has become an integrated part of many peoples ’ lives , and it has the potential to prevent disease . In this systematic review , we summarize the evidence from r and omized controlled trials to compare effects of different  ICT-based interventions  to support  postpartum women  to achieve weight loss  .  Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed , Embase , PsycInfo , CINAHL , Web of Science , Scopus , and Cochrane , search ing on terms , such as postpartum , weight loss , telemedicine , and r and omized controlled trials . Two independent research ers undertook study selection and data extraction . Results were reported narratively . The systematic review only included  studies that were r and omized controlled trials .  Results  Eight studies were included in the systematic review  . All of them were characterized by applying one or more  ICT components  to assist postpartum  women  in  weight control  , and had  weight loss  as an outcome measure . A significant difference was found in  weight loss  between control group and intervention group in the majority of the studies . However , five of the studies had a relatively short follow-up period ( 40 days to 16 weeks ) , six of the studies had a relatively small sample size (  18 to 66 women  ) , and half of the studies indicated challenges with adherence to the interventions over time .  Conclusion ICT-based interventions  can support  postpartum women  to  achieve a healthy lifestyle and weight control .  Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes , longer follow-up periods , and adherence to the interventions . Systematic review registration PROSPERO."

 This systematic review found evidence for short-term effects of  yoga  in improving  psychological health  in  breast cancer patients .  The short-term effects on  health-related quality of life  could not be clearly distinguished from bias .  Yoga  can be recommended as an intervention to improve  psychological health  during breast cancer treatment.
">The WHO recommends integration of  universal mass vaccination ( UMV )  against hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) in national immunization schedules for  children aged ≥1 year  , if justified on the basis of acute HAV incidence , declining endemicity from high to intermediate and cost-effectiveness . This recommendation has been implemented in several countries . Our aim was to assess the impact of  UMV  using  monovalent inactivated hepatitis A vaccines  on incidence and persistence of anti-HAV ( IgG ) antibodies in  pediatric population s.  We conducted a systematic review of literature published between 2000 and 2015 in PubMed , Cochrane Library , LILACS , IBECS identifying  a total of 27 studies ( Argentina , Belgium , China , Greece , Israel , Panama , the United States and Uruguay ) .  All except one study showed a marked decline in  the incidence of hepatitis A  post introduction  of UMV  .  The incidence in non-vaccinated age groups  decreased as well , suggesting herd immunity but also rising  susceptibility . Long-term anti-HAV antibody persistence  was documented up to 17 y after a 2-dose primary vaccination . In conclusion ,  introduction of UMV  in countries with intermediate endemicity for HAV infection led to a considerable  decrease in the incidence of hepatitis A  in  vaccinated  and in non-vaccinated  age groups alike ."
 There is no accepted scientific evidence that  methods aim ing to increase muscle tonus of the stomatognathic system  are effective in reducing  AHI  to below five events per hour . Well- design ed r and omized controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy of such methods.
"sAsthma and wheezing disorders are common chronic health problems in childhood .  Breastfeeding  provides health benefits , but it is not known whether or how  breastfeeding  decreases the risk of developing asthma . We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies published  between 1983 and 2012  on   breastfeeding  and asthma in children from the general population .  We search ed the PubMed and Embase data bases for cohort , cross-sectional , and case-control studies . We grouped the outcomes into  asthma ever  ,  recent asthma  , or  recent wheezing illness  ( recent asthma or recent wheeze ) . Using r and om-effects meta-analyses , we estimated pooled odds ratios of the association of breastfeeding with the risk for each of these outcomes . We performed meta-regression and stratified meta-analyses .  We included 117 of 1,464 titles identified by our search .  The  pooled odds ratios  were 0.78 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.74 , 0.84 ) for 75 studies analyzing ""  asthma ever  , "" 0.76 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.67 , 0.86 ) for 46 studies analyzing "" recent  asthma  , "" and 0.81 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.76 , 0.87 ) for 94 studies analyzing recent wheezing illness . After stratification by age , the strong protective association found at ages 0 - 2 years diminished over time . We found no evidence for differences by study design or study quality or between studies in Western and non-Western countries . A positive association of  breastfeeding  with  reduced asthma/wheezing  is supported by the combined evidence of existing studies."
"oA  bioartificial endocrine  pancreas is proposed as a future alternative to current treatment options .  Patients with insulin-secretion deficiency  might benefit . This is the first systematic review that provides an overview of  scaffold material s and techniques  for insulin-secreting cells or cells to be differentiated into insulin-secreting cells . An electronic literature survey was conducted in PubMed / MEDLINE and Web of Science , limited to the past 10 years . A  total  of  197 articles investigating 60 different material s met the inclusion criteria .  The extracted data on material s , cell types , study design , and transplantation sites were plotted into two evidence gap maps . Integral parts of the tissue engineering network such as  fabrication technique , extracellular matrix , vascularization , immunoprotection , suitable transplantation sites  , and the  use  of  stem cells  are highlighted . This systematic review provides an evidence -based structure for future studies . Accumulating evidence shows that scaffold-based tissue engineering can enhance the  viability and function or differentiation of insulin-secreting cells  both in vitro and in vivo."
"yAbstract We have conducted a meta- analysis and systematic review to determine the  overall survival , mortality rate , and complete resection rate  of  neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( CRT )  compared with  pancreaticoduodenectomy alone  in  patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma .  Whether  neo-adjuvant CRT  is beneficial in the treatment of resectable pancreatic cancer or not , it is still a controversial issue . Medline and Cochrane were search ed with relevant terms .  Eight studies with a total of 833 participants were selected .  The meta- analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses guidelines .The analysis revealed  neo-adjuvant  group may have a benefit in the  overall survival  , as compared with the resection group , although it did not reach statistical significance ( pooled hazard ratio = 0.87 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.75–1.00 , P = 0.051 ) . We found no difference in  the in-hospital mortality rate  ( pooled odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.27 , 95 % CI = 0.35–4.58 , P = 0.710 ) .  The complete resection rate  was significantly higher in the neo-adjuvant group than in the resection group ( pooled OR = 2.39 , 95 % CI = 1.21–4.74 , P = 0.012).This meta- analysis found that there was no significant difference in the  overall survival  between patients treated with neo-adjuvant CRT or pancreaticduodenectomy."
" From the evidence in this review , it is not possible to reassure  people with asthma  that regular use of  inhaled corticosteroids with formoterol  carries no risk of increasing mortality in comparison with use of inhaled corticosteroids alone . On the other h and , we have found no conclusive evidence of serious harm , and only one asthma-related death was registered during more than 4200 patient-years of observation with  formoterol .  In  adults  , no significant difference in  all-cause non-fatal serious adverse events  was noted with regular formoterol with inhaled corticosteroids , but a significant reduction in  asthma-related serious adverse events  was observed in comparison with inhaled  corticosteroids  alone .  In children  the number of events was too small , and consequently the results too imprecise , to allow determination of whether the increased risk of  all-cause non-fatal serious adverse events  found in a previous meta- analysis on regular formoterol alone is abolished by the additional use of inhaled  corticosteroids .  We await the results of large ongoing surveillance studies m and ated by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for more information . Clinical decisions and information provided to patients regarding regular use of  formoterol  have to take into account the balance between known symptomatic benefits of formoterol and the degree of uncertainty associated with its potential harmful effects."
" : It appears that the relative weight given to different therapeutic targets in the development and improvement of UC treatments could be optimized , with an increased emphasis on endoscopic and histological targets over clinical or symptomatic targets . For this evolution to occur , however , new research has to demonstrate that the treat-to-target approach will deliver on the promise of better long-term outcomes compared with current approaches."
" Heat is an effective adjunct to developmental and therapeutic stretching techniques and should be the treatment of choice for enhancing  ROM  in a clinical or sporting setting .

"nThis systematic review investigated the effects on  function , quality of life , health care costs , and patient/carer satisfaction  of  constraint-induced movement therapy (  CIMT  )  for  upper limb hemiparesis following stroke .  A comprehensive search of the complete holdings of MEDLINE , CINAHL , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , PEDro and OTseeker to March 2005 was conducted .  Fourteen eligible r and omised controlled trials  were identified and relevant data extracted by two independent review ers . Effect sizes were calculated and results were pooled where possible . Method  quality  of the trials , assessed using the  PEDro scale  , had a  mean score of five ( range three to seven )  .  Thirteen  trials compared  CIMT  to an alternative treatment and /or a  control  group  .  One trial compared two  CIMT  protocol s. Acute , subacute , and chronic conditions were studied . Effect  sizes  could be estimated for nine trials . Results were significant and in favour of  CIMT  in eight of these for at least one measure of upper limb function . The pooled st and ardised  mean  difference could be calculated for five outcome measures producing moderate to large effect sizes , only one of which attained statistical significance . Results indicate that  CIMT  may  improve upper limb function following stroke  for some patients when compared to alternative or no treatment . Rigorous evaluation of  constraint-induced  movement  therapy  using well- design ed and adequately powered trials is required to evaluate the efficacy of different protocol s on different stroke population s and to assess impact on quality of life , cost and patient/carer satisfaction."
"dThis systematic review and meta- analysis examines the impact of  measuring  ,  monitoring  , and feeding back  information  on client progress to clinicians while they deliver  psychotherapy .  It considers the effects of the 2 most frequently studied  routine outcome monitoring ( ROM ) practice s :  The  Partners for Change Outcome Management System  and the  Outcome Question naire System .  Like other ROM practice s , they typify attempts to enhance routine care by assisting psychotherapists in recognizing problematic treatment response and increasing collaboration between therapist and client to overcome poor treatment response . A total of  24 studies were identified  and considered  suitable  for analysis . Two-thirds of the studies found that  ROM-assisted psychotherapy  was  superior  to treatment-as-usual offered by the same practitioners . Mean st and ardized effect sizes indicated that the effects ranged from small to moderate .  Feedback practice s  reduced  deterioration rates  and nearly doubled  clinical ly significant/reliable change rates  in  clients who were predicted to have a poor outcome .  Clinical examples , diversity considerations , and therapeutic advances are provided."
" Due to low-certainty evidence in the networks , we are unable to draw conclusions on which treatment is most  effective  for preventing  clinical relapse  and  endoscopic relapse .  Evidence on the  safety  of the interventions was inconclusive , however cases of  pancreatitis and leukopenia  from purine analogues were evident in the studies . Larger trials are needed to further underst and the effect of the interventions on endoscopic relapse."
 The review demonstrated evidence of positive effect of psychosocial interventions on  family functioning  of caregivers . More well design ed r and omised controlled trials are needed to further examine the optimal  dose  and format  of  psychosocial interventions   owing to the diversity of interventions.
"nBACKGROUND  Killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccines ( kOCVs )  are becoming a st and ard cholera control and prevention tool . However , vaccine efficacy and direct effectiveness estimates have varied , with differences in study design , location , follow-up duration , and vaccine composition posing challenges for public health decision making . We did a systematic review and meta- analysis to generate average estimates of kOCV efficacy and direct effectiveness from the available literature . METHODS For this systematic review and meta- analysis , we search ed PubMed , Embase , Scopus , and the Cochrane Review Library on July 9 , 2016 , and ISI Web of Science on July 11 , 2016 , for r and omised controlled trials and observational studies that reported estimates of direct protection against medically attended confirmed cholera conferred by kOCVs .  We included studies published on any date in English , Spanish , French , or Chinese .  We extracted from the published reports the primary efficacy and effectiveness estimates from each study and also estimates according to number of vaccine doses , duration , and age group . The main study outcome was  average efficacy and direct effectiveness of two  kOCV doses , which we estimated with r and  om-effect models  . This study is registered with PROSPERO , number CRD42016048232 . FINDINGS  Seven trials ( with 695 patients with cholera ) and six observational studies ( 217 patients with cholera )  met the inclusion criteria , with an  average two-dose efficacy  of 58 % ( 95 % CI 42 - 69 , I2=58 % ) and  effectiveness  of 76 % ( 62 - 85 , I2=0 )  . Average two-dose efficacy  in  children younger than 5 years  ( 30 % [ 95 % CI 15 - 42 ] , I2=0 % ) was lower than in those 5 years or older ( 64 % [ 58 - 70 ] , I2=0 % ;  p<0·0001 ) . Two-dose efficacy estimates of kOCV  were similar during the first 2 years after vaccination , with estimates of 56 % ( 95 % CI 42 - 66 , I2=45 % ) in the first year and 59 % ( 49 - 67 , I2=0 ) in the second  year  .  The efficacy  reduced to 39 % ( 13 to 57 , I2=48 % ) in the third year , and 26 % ( -46 to 63 , I2=74 % ) in the fourth year . INTERPRETATION  Two kOCV  doses provide  protection  against cholera for at least 3 years . One  kOCV  dose provides at least  short-term protection  , which has important implication s for outbreak management .  kOCVs  are effective tools for cholera control .

"yAIM To identify factors found in the research literature to be associated with   smoking cessation  in pregnancy .  METHODS Electronic search es of the bibliographic data bases of PubMed , EMBASE , PsycINFO , Elsevier , Scopus and ISI Web of Science were conducted to April 2017 . All studies reporting factors associated with   smoking cessation  or  continuing smoking during pregnancy   were included and review ed systematic ally , irrespective of study design . The  Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale  was used to assess the study quality . The DerSimonian & Laird r and om-effects model was used to conduct meta-analyses , and where effect estimates were reported for factors included in at least three studies . RESULTS  Fifty-four studies , including 505 584 women globally who smoked before pregnancy , 15 clinical trials and 40 observational studies  ,  were included in the review  and 36 ( 65.5 % ) were considered to be of high quality . This review identified 11 socio-demographic , seven socially related , 19 smoking behaviour-related , five pregnancy-related , six health-related and six psychological factors that were associated significantly with smoking cessation during pregnancy . The most frequently observed significant factors associated with  cessation  were :  higher level of education  ,  pooled odds ratio  ( OR ) , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 2.16 ( 1.80 - 2.84 ) ,  higher socio-economic status :  1.97 ( 1.20 - 3.24 ) ,  overseas maternal birth :  2.00 ( 1.40 - 2.84 ) ,  Medicaid coverage or private insurance  : 1.54 ( 1.29 - 1.85 ) ,  living with partner or married  : 1.49 ( 1.38 - 1.61 ) ,  partner/other members of the household do not smoke :  0.42 ( 0.35 - 0.50 ) ,  lower heaviness of smoking index score  : 0.45 ( 0.27 - 0.77 ,  lower baseline cotinine level  : 0.78 ( 0.64 - 0.94 ) ,  low exposure to second-h and smoking :  0.45 ( 0.20 - 1.02 ) ,  not consuming alcohol before and /or during pregnancy  : 2.03 ( 1.47 - 2.80 ) , primiparity : 1.85 ( 1.68 - 2.05 ) ,  planned breastfeeding:1.99  ( 1.94 - 2.05 ) ,  perceived adequate pre-natal care :  1.74 ( 1.38 - 2.19 ) ,  no depression :  2.65 ( 1.62 - 4.30 ) and low stress during pregnancy : 0.58 ( 0.44 - 0.77 ) .  A wide range of socio-demographics , relationship , social , smoking-related , pregnancy-related , health and psychological factors have been found to predict smoking cessation in pregnancy."
"dBackground Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a common , reproductive endocrinopathy associated with serious short and long term health risks . Many women with PCOS use ingestible  complementary medicines .  This systematic review examined the effect on menstrual regulation and adverse effects from r and omised controlled trials . Methods R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) that compared  herbal or nutritional supplements to placebo  or  active controls  in  women with PCOS  were eligible for inclusion . Electronic data bases were search ed to July 2017 . Study selection and assessment of quality were conducted independently by two review authors . Results  Twenty four studies ( 1406 women ) investigating seven  nutritional supplements  and four  herbal medicines  were included .  No one study was assessed as having a low risk of bias . Four trials reported on the primary endpoint  menstrual regulation .  There was no evidence on  improved menstrual regularity  for calcium plus vitamin D compared to Metformin ( RR : 0.66 , 95 % CI 0.35 to 1.23 , p = 0.19 ) ,  reduced amenorrhoea  for Camellia sinensis compared to placebo ( RR : 0.17 , 95 % CI 0.02 to 1.72 , p = 0.13 ) and no difference in  the number of menses per month  for Cinnamomum sp. against placebo ( MD 0.05 , 95 % CI -0.36 to 1.36 ,  p = 0.26).Adverse effects  were investigated in seven studies ( 164 women )  . Mild adverse effects  were found for Cinnamomum sp. compared to placebo ( 17 women , RR : 0.36 , 95 % CI 0.03 to 0.70 , p = 0.03 ) . No difference was found  for adverse effects  between inositol , B complex  vitamins , vitamin D ,  chromium and placebo .  Improved reproduction , metabolic hormones and hyper and rogenism  was found for inositol and improved cholesterol for omega three fish oils . Conclusion There is no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of nutritional supplements and herbal medicine for  women with PCOS  and evidence of safety is lacking . High quality trials of nutritional supplements and herbal  medicines  examining menstrual regulation and adverse effects in women with PCOS are needed."
 There is currently no evidence that  metformin  is associated with an increased risk of major birth defects in  women affected by PCOS and treated during the first trimester .  However larger ad hoc studies are warranted in order to definitely confirm the safety and efficacy of this drug in pregnancy.
"yAdequate adolescent nutrition is an important step for optimal growth and development . In this article , we systematic ally review ed published studies  till December 2014  to ascertain the effectiveness of interventions to improve  adolescent nutrition .  We found one existing systematic review on interventions to prevent obesity which we up date d and conducted de novo review s for  micronutrient supplementation and nutrition interventions  for  pregnant adolescents .  Our review findings suggest that  micronutrient supplementation  among  adolescents ( predominantly females )  can significantly decrease  anemia prevalence  ( relative risk [ RR ] : .69 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : .62-.76 ) while interventions to improve nutritional status among "" pregnant adolescents "" showed statistically significant  improved birth weight  ( st and ard mean difference : .25 ; 95 % CI : .08-.41 ) ,  decreased low birth weight  ( RR : .70 ; 95 % CI : .57-.84 ) , and  preterm birth  ( RR : .73 ; 95 % CI : .57-.95 ) . Interventions to promote nutrition and prevent obesity had a marginal impact on  reducing body mass index  ( st and ard mean difference : -.08 ; 95 % CI : -.17 to .01 ) . However , these findings should be interpreted with caution due to significant statistical heterogeneity."
" This review shows that in  COPD exacerbations  with  increased cough and sputum purulence  antibiotics , regardless of choice , reduce the risk of  short-term mortality  by 77 % , decrease the  risk  of  treatment failure  by 53 % and the risk of  sputum  purulence by 44 % ; with a small increase in  the risk of diarrhoea .  These results should be interpreted with caution due to the differences in patient selection , antibiotic choice , small number of included trials and lack of control for interventions that influence outcome , such as use of systemic corticosteroids and ventilatory support . Nevertheless , this review supports antibiotics for patients with COPD exacerbations with increased  cough and sputum purulence  who are moderately or severely ill."
" When  breastfeeding support  is offered to women , the duration and exclusivity  of breastfeeding  is increased . Characteristics of effective support include : that it is offered as st and ard by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care , that it includes ongoing scheduled visits so that women can predict when support will be available , and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs of the population group . Support is likely to be more effective in setting s with high initiation rates . Support may be offered either by professional or lay/peer supporters , or a combination of both . Strategies that rely mainly on face-to-face support are more likely to succeed with women practising exclusive breastfeeding."
"eThe aim of the paper was to review the literature about  safety and efficiency  of  acupuncture  therapy in  term and preterm infants .  We search ed Medline , EMBASE , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a predefined algorithm , review ed abstract s from the Pediatric Academic Society annual meetings ( 2000–2012 ) , and performed a manual search of references in narrative and systematic review s. A total of  26 studies identified met  our  search  criteria . Only  6  of  these studies  met our inclusion criteria ; however , two studies had to be excluded because the manuscripts were published in Chinese . Hence , only four studies were included in our analysis . Three of the four studies evaluated the  effects of  acupuncture  on infantile colic  , and one assessed  pain reduction during minor painful procedures  in preterm babies . The limited data available suggests that  acupuncture  could be a safe nonpharmacologic treatment option for  pain reduction  in term and preterm infants and could also be a non-pharmacologic treatment option to treat  infantile  colic . Currently  acupuncture  in infants should be limited to clinical trials and studies evaluating short- and long-term effects and should be performed only by practitioners with adequate training and experience in  neonatal/pediatric  acupuncture."
" The data do not allow firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of  acupuncture  for acute low back pain . For chronic low back pain ,  acupuncture  is more effective for  pain relief and functional improvement  than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only .  Acupuncture  is not more  effective  than other conventional and "" alternative "" treatments . The data suggest that  acupuncture and dry-needling  may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low back pain . Because most of the studies were of lower method ologic quality , there is a clear need for higher quality trials in this area."
" The evidence that  calcium  reduces  cramp  is weak and seems to depend on placebo effect . The evidence for  sodium chloride  is stronger but the results of the  sodium chloride  trial may no longer be relevant because of dietary changes which include an increased sodium intake in the general population . It is not possible to recommend  multivitamins with mineral supplementation  , as it is not clear which ingredient , if any , is helping . If a woman finds  cramp  troublesome in pregnancy , the best evidence is for  magnesium lactate  or citrate taken as 5mmol in the morning and 10mmol in the evening."
" In this up date d review , tailoring asthma interventions based on sputum eosinophils is beneficial in reducing the  frequency of asthma exacerbations  in  adults with asthma . Adults with frequent exacerbations and severe asthma  may derive the greatest benefit from this additional monitoring test , although we were unable to confirm this through subgroup analysis . There is insufficient data available to assess tailoring asthma medications based on  sputum  eosinophilia in  children .  Further robust RCTs need to be undertaken and these should include  participants  with different underlying asthma severities and endotypes."
"ePregnancy and lactation are a time when adequate calcium consumption is essential for the development of the fetus and to ensure the health of the mother . Over 50 % of Canadian women of childbearing  and  rearing age fail to meet the recommended daily intake of calcium . Identification of effective behavioural  intervention  strategies for increasing  calcium intake  is needed within this specific population . This paper brings together all published behavioural interventions design ed to increase  calcium consumption  in  pregnant , lactating or post-partum mothers  in a systematic review . Relevant studies were obtained through search es of MEDLINE , EMBASE , PsycINFO , CINAHL and the Cochrane Library with no date restrictions . Studies were evaluated using previously published criteria for evaluating calcium behaviour change interventions . This systematic literature review identified five  behavioural calcium interventions  conducted within this population . Three interventions aim ed to  improve  overall dietary behaviours   , the fourth aim ed to   promote breastfeeding (  including  increasing calcium consumption )   and the fifth aim ed  to increase  daily servings of yoghurt .   Only one of the five interventions yielded large effect sizes , with a mean change of 954 mg of calcium per day post-intervention . The number of behavioural  change  techniques did not appear to be related to intervention efficacy . Only one study used a theoretical framework to guide the intervention . This review highlights the lack of research examining  behaviour change interventions  aim ed at increasing  calcium consumption  in  pregnant , lactating and post-partum women  and provides practical suggestions for research ers wishing to intervene with this population in the future."
"nMyopia has a multifactorial etiology , although environmental factors are predominant in determining its current patterns . Currently , associations between  near work activities  and  myopia  have not been consistently observed . Therefore , we performed a systematic review to quantify the effect of  near work activities  on   myopia  in children . Relevant articles published between 1989 and 2014 were identified  in MEDLINE , Embase , and the Cochrane Library , and the citation lists were review ed .  Twelve cohort studies and 15 cross-sectional studies were included ( 25,025 children aged between 6 and 18 years ) .  The I2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity . Study -level data were pooled using a r and om-effects model or a fixed-effects model ( when less than 5 studies were included ) . We found that more  time  spent  on  near work activities   was associated with  higher odds of myopia  ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1.14 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.08 - 1.20 ) and that the odds  of myopia  increased by 2 % ( OR:1.02 ; 95 % CI = 1.01 - 1.03 ) for every one diopter-hour ( hr ) more of near work per week . Therefore , the development of a strategy to reduce the  impact of near work on myopia  would be important for preventing myopia in children."

"sThe relationship between  survival  and time to the start of  adjuvant chemotherapy ( AC )  among  breast cancer patients  is unclear . In order to illustrate the effect of delaying the initiation of  AC  on  survival  we have undertaken a systematic review and meta- analysis . We identified  12 available studies in the meta- analysis  including  15 independent analytical groups .  This meta- analysis showed that a 4-week delay before  AC  was associated with a significantly  worse overall survival (OS)(HR=1.13  ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.08–1.19 )  and disease free survival (DFS)(HR=1.14  ; 95%CI , 1.05–1.24 ) . Two studies categorized  patients into hormone receptor-positive , ERBB2-positive , and triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patients according to the clinicopathological features of breast cancer .  The  HRs for OS  between waiting  time  ( WT ) ≤30 days and 31–60 days in the subgroups were extracted and analyzed . The analysis demonstrated that a WT of 31–60 days was related to  worse OS  among  patients  with TNBC ( HR , 1.26 ; 95 % CI , 1.08–1.48 ) , but had no significant effect  on OS  among those with hormone receptor-positive ( HR , 1.02 ; 95 % CI , 0.89–1.15 ) or ERBB2-postive ( HR , 0.95 ; 95%CI , 0.79–1.14 ) tumors . In this meta- analysis of the eligible literature s review ing the  time to AC  , a longer waiting time to  adjuvant chemotherapy  may lead to  worse survival  in  breast cancer patients  , especially in TNBC patients."
"eEXECUTIVE SUMMARY This systematic review investigated the prescription , administration and effectiveness of  oral liquid nutritional supplements ( OLNS )  for  people with dementia in residential aged care facilities ( RACF ) .  Dementia is an umbrella term for a large group of conditions that cause a progressive decline in a person 's functioning . There are different forms of dementia and each has its own causes .  Residents with Alzheimer 's disease and dementia  are particularly vulnerable to  malnutrition  and  weight loss  because of increased energy dem and s due to pacing or w and ering ;  food refusal  due to lack of appetite , agitation or memory loss ; or  physical deterioration  leading to inability to self-feed , chew or swallow , though these symptoms are not unique to persons with dementia . Maintaining adequate nutrition for  persons with dementia in residential care  , in the context of these special needs , presents an increased challenge . A comprehensive search of relevant data bases , h and search ing and cross-referencing found  15 relevant articles from a total of 2910 possible results .Included  studies examined a range of strategies , issues and results related to  OLNS  for  persons with dementia in RACFs ;  however there appear to be significant gaps in the current body of research , particularly in relation to examinations of  effectiveness .  Thus , this review was unable to produce a definitive finding regarding effectiveness . MAIN FINDINGS  : From this systematic review it is clear that further research is required into the prescription , administration and effectiveness of  OLNS .  No definitive evidence of effectiveness for  OLNS  was found . However , our findings suggest that if administered with care and assistance and prescribed after investigation of the reasons for  weight loss  and /or  poor oral intake  ,  OLNS  may play a role in maintaining  protein and energy intake .  Consequently , it can be inferred that  OLNS  may contribute to the promotion of healthy and optimal functioning in persons with dementia who are living in residential aged care."
" Universal prenatal  supplementation with iron or iron+folic acid  provided either daily or weekly is effective to prevent  anaemia  and iron deficiency at term . We found no evidence , however , of the significant reduction in substantive  maternal and neonatal adverse clinical outcomes ( low birthweight , delayed development , preterm birth , infection , postpartum haemorrhage )  . Associated side effects and particularly  haemoconcentration  during pregnancy may suggest the need for revising iron doses and schemes of supplementation during pregnancy and adjust preventive iron supplementation recommendations."
"eAustralian & New Zeal and Journal of Psychiatry , 48(2 ) The perspective ‘ Rethinking  psychotropics  in nursing homes ’ ( Hilmer and Gnjidic , 2013 ) raises justifiable concern regarding the potential overuse of  psychotropic medication  in  Australian residential aged care facilities ( RACFs )  , which we argue is actually a downstream effect of systemic problems in the provision of mental health care in the RACF environment ( Snowdon , 2010 ) and thus requires broader scale interventions . The  psychiatric morbidity  of  RACF residents  is alarming : an international systematic review found that dementia had a prevalence of 58 % , with 78 % of  those with dementia  exhibiting  behavioural and psychological symptoms (  BPSD  )  . In addition ,  major depression  had a prevalence of 10 % and  depressive symptoms  were evident in 28 % ( Seitz et al. , 2010 ) . There is no room for therapeutic nihilism ( Macfarlane et al. , 2012 ) in the presence of burgeoning evidence of the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions ( CohenMansfield et al. , 2012 ; Conn and Seitz , 2010 ; Kolanowski et al. , 2011 ; Leone et al. , 2013 ; O’Connor et al. , 2009 ) , as well as evidence for the judicious usage of  antidepressants  ( Seitz et al. , 2011 ) ,  antipsychotics  ( Ballard et al. , 2006 ) and cognition-enhancing agents in at least some residents with BPSD ( Conn and Seitz , 2010 ) . Routine discontinuation of  antipsychotics  ( Devan and et al. , 2012 ) and antidepressants ( Bergh et al. , 2012 ) in people with dementia may have  adverse outcomes , with recurrence of the disorders and increased distress .  As experienced geriatric psychiatrists , we argue that a comprehensive systemic approach is required to care for and support people with  BPSD  and other types of  mental illness  in  RACFs .  This approach should encompass structured assessment of problem behaviours and symptoms , targeted  psychological and pharmacological interventions  , appropriate levels of properly remunerated staff who have undergone dementia-specific education and training , and physical design components to produce a prosthetic environment . Hilmer and Gnjidic ( 2013 ) asserted that ‘ ... we tend to use  [ psychotropic medications  ] too often , for too long , at doses that are too high , in dangerous combinations ... ’ ( p.77 ) . They cited findings from a series of studies in  44 nursing homes in Sydney  ( Snowdon et al. , 2011 ) . This series of studies found that between 1993 and 2009 the use of regularly administered   antipsychotics   rose from 27 % to 28 % ; regular   hypnotics   dropped from 26 % to 11 % ; regular   anxiolytics   dropped from 8.6 % to 4.7 % ; regular   antidepressants   rose from 15.6 % to 25.6 % ; and the overall  psychotropic  use ( all classes combined ) dropped from 58.9 % to 47.5 % . From these findings it is clear that lumping all  psychotropic medications  into a single category obscures the complexities of usage of these drugs ( Snowdon et al. , 2011 ) . Despite this caveat , we agree that critical review of medications for the treatment of BPSD for  persons residing in RACFs  is important and that changes to treatment regimens , including starting and stopping medication , warrant careful consideration ; especially since a recent Australian study showed that medications for  RACF residents  were infrequently review ed ( O’Connor et al. , 2010 ) . We have argued elsewhere ( Macfarlane et al. , 2012 ) that the limited evidence of  efficacy  of  antidepressants  in people with dementia is likely to arise from the rather limited volume and sophistication of the available evidence , whilst acknowledging that depressive symptoms and disorders may be difficult to ascertain , monitor and treat in this population . A Cochrane Systematic Review noted there were few trials of treatment of  BPSD  with antidepressants , but concluded that two selective serotonin Systemic approach to  behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia  in residential aged care."
" : Reporting of  PRP preparation protocol  s in clinical studies is highly inconsistent , and the majority of studies did not provide sufficient information to allow the protocol to be reproduced .

"sBACKGROUND  Positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP )  is an important component of therapy in  patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome .  The independent effect of PEEP on  mortality  is currently unknown . METHODS A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled clinical trials comparing the use of  higher and lower levels of PEEP .  RESULTS  Six trials with a total of 2,484 patients from 102 intensive care units and 9 countries met the eligibility criteria .  In three trials , the effect of different levels of PEEP was compared in groups receiving comparable tidal volumes . Three trials accounted for more than 85 % of total weighting in the meta-analyses . The  pooled relative risk  obtained from these three trials showed a trend towards  improved mortality  with high PEEP , even though the difference did not reach statistical significance : Pooled cumulative risk of 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.72 - 1.02 , P = 0.077 ) . The  reduction in absolute risk of death  was approximately 4 % . There was no evidence of a significant  increase in baro-trauma  in patients receiving high PEEP , with a pooled risk of 0.95 ( 95 % CI 0.62 - 1.45 , P = 0.81 ) .   High PEEP  strategy may have a clinical ly relevant independent  mortality  benefit . Despite a possible increase in baro-trauma , the benefits far outweigh potential risks . Current evidence therefore favors the use of  high  PEEP as the preferred option when ventilating  patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome .  As the reduction in absolute  risk  of  death  is less than 5 % , a future clinical trial aim ed at demonstrating statistical significance is likely to pose considerable financial and ethical burdens."

"nBackground To analyse available evidence on the  efficacy and safety  of  anti-TNFα drugs ( infliximab , etanercept and adalimumab )  for treating  rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .  Methods We search ed systematic ally for r and omised controlled clinical trials on  treatment  of  RA with  anti-TNFα drugs   , followed by a systematic review with meta analysis . Trials were search ed from MEDLINE , EMBASE and Cochrane Library data bases . The American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) efficacy response criteria were used .  Safety parameters  provided by the trials were also assessed . Positive and undesired  effects  were estimated  using combined relative risks ( RR ) , number needed to treat ( NNT ) and number needed to harm ( NNH ) .  Heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochrane 's Q and I2 statistics . Results  Thirteen trials ( 7087 patients ) met the inclusion criteria .   The combined RR  to  achieve a therapeutic response  to treatment with recommended doses of any  anti-TNFα  drug was 1.81 ( 95 % CI 1.43–2.29 ) with a NNT of 5 ( 5–6 ) for ACR20 . NNT for ACR50 [ 5 ( 5–6 ) ] and ACR70 [ 7 ( 7–9 ) ] were similar  . Overall therapeutic effects  were also similar regardless of the specific anti-TNFα drug used and when higher than recommended doses were administered . However , lower than recommended doses elicited  low ACR70  responses ( NNT 15 ) . Comparison  of anti-TNFα drugs plus methotrexate ( MTX ) with MTX  alone in  patients  with insufficient prior responses  to MTX  showed  NNT  values of 3 for ACR20 , 4 for ACR50 and 8 for ACR70 . Comparison of  anti-TNFα drugs  with  placebo  showed a similar pattern . Comparisons  of anti-TNFα drugs plus MTX with MTX  alone in  patients with no previous resistance  to  MTX  showed somewhat  lower  effects .  Etanercept  and  adalimumab  administered as monotherapy showed effects similar to those of  MTX   . Side effects  were more common among patients receiving  anti-TNFα drugs  than controls ( overall combined NNH 27 ) .  Patients receiving  infliximab   were more likely to drop out  because of side effects  ( NNH 24 ) and to  suffer severe side effects  ( NNH 31 )  , infections  ( NNH 10 )  and infusion reactions  ( NNH 9 ) .  Patients receiving   adalimumab  were also more likely to drop out  because of side effects  ( NNH 47 ) and to  suffer injection site reactions  ( NNH 22 ) .  Patients receiving  etanercept   were less likely to drop out  because of side effects  ( NNH for control versus  etanercept  26 ) but more likely to experience  injection site reactions  ( NNH 5 ) . Conclusion  Anti-TNFα drugs  are effective in  RA patients  , with apparently similar results irrespective of the drug administered . Doses other than those recommended are also beneficial . The main factor influencing therapeutic efficacy is the prior response to DMARD treatment . The effect of treatment with  etanercept  or adalimumab does not differ from that obtained with  MTX .  The published  safety profile  for  etanercept  is superior but the fact that no patients are treated with higher than recommended doses requires explanation."

"nBACKGROUND AND AIM Epidemiological data has established increasing adiposity as a risk factor for incident  asthma  .   However , the mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and asthma are incompletely understood . In the present paper , we review current knowledge of possible mechanisms mediating the observed association between  obesity and asthma .  METHODS Systematic literature review . RESULTS Obesity and asthma share some etiological factors , such as a common genetic predisposition and effects of in utero conditions , and may also have common predisposing factors such as physical activity and diet . Obesity results in important changes in the mechanical properties of the respiratory system which could explain the occurrence of asthma . However , there are also plausible biological mechanisms whereby obesity could be expected to either cause or worsen  asthma .  These include  co-morbidities  such as  gastro-oesophageal reflux , complications from sleep-disordered breathing , breathing at low lung volumes , chronic systemic inflammation , and endocrine factors  ,  including adipokines and reproductive hormones .  Obesity related asthma is in general not associated with eosinophilic  airway  inflammation , and adipokines are likely to play important roles in the inflammatory  pathogenesis of  asthma in  obese individuals  .  The association between obesity and asthma is not straightforward , and further knowledge is clearly needed , as underst and ing the underlying mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic options for this high-risk part of the  asthma  population."

"dEvidence suggests that adverse nutritional exposures during in utero development may contribute to heightened risk of  obesity in childhood .  Pregnancy offers the opportunity to modify the intrauterine environment by manipulation of  diet and /or physical activity  , which may result in favourable health benefits for the child . The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether  antenatal lifestyle interventions  in  pregnant women  , aim ed at modifying diet and  /or physical activity  , and lead to a reduction in measures of offspring obesity in  early  childhood . Three electronic data bases were search ed from January 1990 to July 2017 for  antenatal  interventions with subsequent offspring follow-up publications .  Eight trials were identified . Five trials included women from all body mass index categories , and 3 trials included obese women only .  Children in the offspring  follow-up  studies were  aged 6 months to 7 years  .  Measures of adiposity  in the offspring ( n = 1989 ) included  weight , body mass index , z-scores , circumferences , and skinfold thicknesses .  Two studies , focusing on  obese women  only , reported reduced  measures of adiposity ( subscapular skinfold thickness and weight-for-age z-score )  at 6 and 12 months , respectively . The remaining 6 studies , two from  infancy  and 4  in early childhood  found no effect on  measures of adiposity . Measures of obesity  up to 12 months of age have been shown to be reduced by antenatal  lifestyle interventions  during pregnancy in  obese women .  Due to the heterogeneity of the methodology of the antenatal interventions and the reported offspring outcomes we were unable to draw any conclusion on the influence of antenatal interventions on  measures of obesity  in early childhood."
"sThe brain is the most significant and complex organ of the human body . Increasingly , we are becoming aware that certain nutrients may help to safeguard brain  health  . An expanse of research has investigated the effects of  omega fatty acids  in relation to brain health but effects across the lifespan have not been widely evaluated . The present systematic review collated evidence from  25 r and omized controlled trials ( n = 3633 ) published since 2013 .  Compared with control groups  , omega-3 supplementation  generally correlated with improvements in  blood biomarkers .  Subsequently , these appear to benefit those  with lower baseline fatty acid levels  , who  are breastfeeding or who  have neuropsychiatric conditions . Whilst multiple studies indicate that  omega fatty acids  can protect against  neurodegeneration  in  older adults  , more work is needed in the years preceding the diagnosis of such medical conditions . Bearing in mind the scale of ageing population s and rising healthcare costs linked to poor brain health ,  omega supplementation  could be a useful strategy for helping to augment dietary intakes and support  brain health  across the lifespan . Ongoing research is now needed using harmonious method ologies , supplement dosages , ratios and intervention periods to help formulate congruent conclusions."
"nPostoperative   pulmonary complications  following cardiac and thoracic surgery  are common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality .

More recently ,  noninvasive ventilation  has been studied in selective  surgical patient population  s with the goal of preventing  postoperative complications  and treating  acute respiratory failure .  In this clinical review , we will briefly examine the incidence of  pulmonary complications following  cardiothoracic surgery   and the physiology and mechanics of acute respiratory failure and   noninvasive  ventilation .  We then present a systematic review of the indications , patient selection , and current literature investigating the specific use of  noninvasive ventilation  in this population."
"dABSTRACT Introduction : Occlusal side effects or development of  pain and /or functional impairment  of the temporom and ibular complex are potential reasons for poor compliance or ab and onment of  m and ibular advancement splints  treatment for  snoring and obstructive sleep apnea .  Objective : This study aim ed at providing a comprehensive review evaluating the craniofacial side effects of  oral appliance therapy  for  snoring and obstructive sleep apnea .  Methods : An electronic search was systematic ally conducted in PubMed and Virtual Health Library from their inception until October 2016 .  Only R and omized Controlled  Trials whose primary aim was to measure objective ly identified side effects on craniofacial complex of a  custom-made oral appliance  for treating  primary snoring or obstructive sleep apnea were included . Studied patients should be aged 20 or older .  The risk of bias in the trials was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of The Cochrane Risk of Bias criteria . Results :  A total of 62 full-text articles were assessed  for  eligibility .  After the review process ,  only 6 met all the inclusion criteria .  All studies were rated as having a high risk of bias . The most uniformly reported  m and ibular advancement splint  side  effects  were predominantly of dental nature and included a  decrease in overjet and overbite .  The  risk of developing pain and function impairment of the temporom and ibular complex  appeared limited with long-term  m and ibular advancement splint  use . Conclusion : The limited available evidence suggests that  m and ibular advancement splint therapy  for  snoring and obstructive sleep  apnea results in changes in craniofacial morphology that are predominantly dental in nature , specially on a long-term basis . Considering the chronic nature of obstructive sleep apnea and that oral appliance use might be a lifelong treatment , a thorough customized follow-up should therefore be undertaken to detect possible side effects on craniofacial complex . It is also important to provide adequate information to the patients regarding these possible changes , especially to those in whom larger occlusal changes are to be expected or in whom they are unfavorable . Long-term assessment s of adverse effects of  oral appliance therapy  , with larger study sample s and recruitment of homogenous patient population are still required."
"NThis systematic review and meta- analysis investigated  ω-3 fatty-acid enriched parenteral nutrition ( PN ) vs st and ard ( non-ω-3 fatty-acid enriched ) PN  in  adult hospitalized patients  ( PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018110179 ) . We included  49 r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs )  with intervention and control groups given  ω-3 fatty acids and st and ard lipid emulsions  , respectively , as part of PN covering ≥70 % energy provision .  The relative risk ( RR ) of infection  ( primary outcome ; 24 RCTs ) was  40  % lower  with ω-3 fatty-acid enriched PN  than  st and ard  PN ( RR 0.60 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.49 - 0.72 ; P < 0.00001 ) . Patients given ω-3  fatty-acid enriched  PN  had reduced mean length of intensive care unit ( ICU )  stay ( 10 RCTs ; 1.95 days , 95 % CI 0.42 - 3.49 ; P =  0.01 ) and reduced length of hospital stay  ( 26 RCTs ; 2.14 days , 95 % CI 1.36 -  2.93  ;  P < 0.00001 ) . Risk of sepsis  ( 9 RCTs ) was reduced by 56 % in those given ω-3  fatty-acid  enriched PN ( RR 0.44 , 95 % CI 0.28  - 0.70 ; P = 0.0004 ) . Mortality  rate ( co- primary outcome ; 20 RCTs ) showed a nonsignificant 16 % reduction ( RR 0.84 , 95 % CI 0.65 - 1.07 ; P = 0.15 ) for the ω-3 fatty-acid enriched group . In  summary  , ω-3  fatty-acid  enriched PN  is beneficial , reducing risk of infection and  sepsis by 40 % and 56 % ,  respectively , and  length  of both ICU and hospital  stay by about 2 days .  Provision of ω-3-enriched lipid emulsions  should be preferred  over st and ard lipid emulsions  in patients with an indication  for  PN."
"eCONTEXT Interventions targeting maternal obesity are a healthcare and public health priority . OBJECTIVE The objective of this review was to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the method ological design s implemented in  dietary intervention  trials for  obesity in pregnancy .  DATA SOURCES A systematic review of the literature , consistent with PRISMA guidelines , was performed as part of the International Weight Management in Pregnancy collaboration . STUDY SELECTION  Thirteen r and omized controlled trials  , which aim ed to modify diet and physical activity in  overweight and obese pregnant women  ,  were identified  . DATA SYNTHESIS There was significant variability in the  content , delivery , and dietary assessment methods  of the dietary interventions examined . A number of studies demonstrated  improved dietary behavior  in response to  diet and  /or  lifestyle interventions .  Nine studies reduced  gestational weight gain .   This review reveals large method ological variability in  dietary interventions  to control  gestational weight gain  and improve clinical outcomes in  overweight and obese pregnant women .  This lack of consensus limits the ability to develop clinical guidelines and apply the evidence in clinical practice."
"dAcupuncture has been reported to affect the autonomic system . Currently , there are no systematic review s examining the effect of  acupuncture  on HRV available in the literature . Therefore , the aim of this systematic review was to summarize and critically assess the effects of  acupuncture  on  heart rate variability .  We search ed the literature using  14 data bases  for articles published from the earliest available publications until October 2009 without language restrictions . We included r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) comparing  acupuncture and sham acupuncture .  The risk of bias in each study was assessed using the Cochrane criteria .  Twelve RCTs met  all of the inclusion criteria . One RCT evaluated the effects of  acupuncture  in  patients with minor depression or anxiety disorders  and another RCT examined the effect of  acupuncture   on migraine patients .  Another four RCTs tested the effects of  acupuncture  in  healthy subjects who were exposed to several conditions , including  mental stress  ,  fatigue from driving  , and  caffeine intake .   The remaining six RCTs assessed the effects of  acupuncture  on  healthy subjects in a normal state without any stressors .  Five RCTs found  significant differences in HRV  between  patients treated with  acupuncture   versus those treated with  sham acupuncture  ( controls ) . However , the majority of the other RCTs showed inconsistent results or did not identify  significant differences in HRV spectral parameters  among individuals treated with  acupuncture  as compared to those treated with  sham acupuncture .  In conclusion , sham-controlled RCTs showed variable results and no clear evidence that  acupuncture  has any specific effects on  HRV .  Therefore , more rigorous research appears to be warranted."
"sThis systematic review focused on the common  conventional physiotherapy interventions  used with  children with cerebral palsy ( CP ) , aged 4 to 18 years  , and critically appraised the recent evidence of each of these interventions using the Oxford Centre for Evidence -Based Medicine Levels of Evidence . The search strategy yielded  34 articles after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied .  The investigated  physiotherapy interventions  included  strength and functional training , weight-supported treadmill training ( WBSTT ) , and neurodevelopmental treatment ( NDT ) .  A category of treatment dosage was also included . Strength  training  was the most studied intervention with significant improvements found in the  strength  of selected muscle groups using  dynamometry  , with fewer studies showing significant improvement in function . Functional training showed improvements in  gross motor function , endurance , and temperospatial measures , such as gait speed and stride length .  Nonsignificant trends of improvement on the  Gross Motor Function Measure ( GMFM ) and gait velocity  were found for WBSTT by a few studies with low levels of evidence ( case series ) . Of three studies that evaluated NDT , one high-level evidence study , i.e. , r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) found significant improvements on the GMFM . All studies review ing treatment dosage had high levels of evidence ( RCTs ) , yet found no significant differences for different intensities of treatment . These results indicate that the levels of evidence for  physiotherapy  interventions , particularly strengthening and to a lesser extent functional training , in  school-aged children with CP  has improved ; however , further high-level evidence is needed for other interventions."
" The available data suggest that surgical methods remain the gold st and ard in BCC treatment , with Mohs  micrographic  surgery typically utilized for high-risk lesions . Suitable alternate treatment options for appropriately selected primary low-risk lesions may include  PDT , cryotherapy , topical imiquimod , and 5-FU . Radiotherapy  is a suitable alternate for surgical methods for treatment in  older patient population  s. Electrodesiccation  and curettage  ( ED&C ) is a commonly used primary treatment option for low-risk lesions ; however , there were no RCTs examining ED&C that met our inclusion criteria .  New hedgehog pathway inhibitors  are promising for the management of advanced BCC  ;  however ,  side effects  are a concern for some patients , and much remains to be learned regarding  optimal treatment length , risk of recurrence , and potential development of resistance  . There is insufficient evidence at present to make recommendations on  topical solasodine glycoalkaloids , topical ingenol mebutate , and intralesional 5-FU and IFN-α .  Overall continued research on the efficacy of treatment modalities is needed . In particular , studies should include histologic ascertainment of clearance , long-term follow-up , stratification based on tumor subtype , and comparison with surgical outcomes."
"eLatent infection with cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) is thought to accelerate aging of the immune system . With age ,  influenza vaccine  responses are impaired . Although several studies investigated the effect of CMV infection on  antibody responses  to  influenza vaccination  , this led to contradicting conclusions . Therefore , we investigated the relation between CMV infection and the  antibody response  to  influenza  vaccination   by performing a systematic review and meta- analysis .  All studies on the  antibody response  to  influenza vaccination  in association with CMV infection were included ( n = 17 ) .  The following outcome variables were extracted : ( a ) the  geometric mean titer pre-/post-vaccination ratio ( GMR )  per CMV serostatus group , and in addition ( b ) the percentage of  subjects with a  response per CMV serostatus group and ( c ) the association between influenza- and CMV-specific  antibody titers .  The influenza-specific  GMR  revealed no clear evidence for an effect of CMV seropositivity on the  influenza vaccine  response in  young or old individuals .  Meta- analysis of the  response rate to  influenza vaccination   showed a non-significant trend towards a negative effect of CMV seropositivity . However , funnel plot analysis suggests that this is a consequence of publication bias . A weak negative association between  CMV antibody titers and influenza antibody titers  was reported in several studies , but associations could not be analyzed systematic ally due to the variety of outcome variables . In conclusion , by systematic ally integrating the available studies , we show that there is no unequivocal evidence that latent CMV infection affects the  influenza antibody response  to vaccination . Further studies , including the  level of CMV antibodies  , are required to settle on the potential influence of latent CMV infection on the influenza vaccine response."
" On the basis of the current review , there is scant evidence to guide clinicians about how gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities should influence the choice of pain treatment in  patients with rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis or other spondylarthritis .  Based upon additional studies that included a mixed population of participants with a range of rheumatic conditions ,  NSAIDs  should be used cautiously in  patients with inflammatory arthritis and a history of gastrointestinaI comorbidity  as there is consistent evidence that they may be at increased risk."
" There is no clear evidence from trials that any 2p+1 , 3p+0 or 3p+1 schedule  of Hib conjugate vaccine  is likely to provide better protection against Hib disease than other schedules . Until more data become available , scheduling is likely to be determined by epidemiological and programmatic considerations in individual setting."
 There are no published studies of  simple psychological interventions  for vaccination pain  in adults .  There is some evidence of a benefit from other  needle procedures for breathing strategies  and neutral signaling of the start of the procedure . There is no evidence for use of  music  or visual distraction.
 The  adjuvant vaccine  has a good  efficacy and safety profile .  The adverse effects that may occur are common and appear similarly in both vaccination groups.
 The meta- analysis showed that combined therapy involving  CRS and PIC  had a statistically significant  survival benefit  over control groups.
" While  MI  has high face validity across a number of domains in physical health care setting s , the general quality of trials in this area is inadequate and therefore recommendations for its dissemination in this area can not yet be made . More research into  MI  applied to health behaviour change is urgently required."
"rThe use of  exercise testing  as an objective assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical oncology research has increased substantially over the past decade . However , its quality has not been assessed . We did a systematic review of studies of  formal exercise testing  for  adults with cancer .  Studies were assessed according to the American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians ( ATS/ACCP ) recommendations for exercise testing . Overall , the reporting of  exercise-testing  methods and data for  adults with cancer  suggests that the conduct of these tests does not comply with national and international quality guidelines . We give recommendations for  exercise testing  in clinical oncology research . The adoption of consistent , formal st and ards for methods and data reporting in  exercise testing  is needed to ensure high- quality research in clinical oncology . Overall , we present information for clinicians and exercise-oncology research ers who assess and care for patients with cancer."
" There is low- quality evidence supporting the use of  PC6 acupoint stimulation  over  sham .  Compared to the last up date in 2009 , no further sham comparison trials are needed . We found that there is moderate- quality evidence showing no  difference  between  PC6  acupoint stimulation  and antiemetic  drugs   to prevent  PONV .  Further  PC6 acupoint stimulation  versus  antiemetic trials  are futile in showing a significant difference , which is a new finding in this up date . There is inconclusive evidence supporting the use of a combined strategy of  PC6 acupoint stimulation and antiemetic drug  over drug prophylaxis , and further high- quality trials are needed."
"nObjective This study aims to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of  acupuncture  for the treatment of   cervical vertigo ( CV  )  .   Methods R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) regarding effectiveness of  acupuncture  for treating CV were search ed in 7 comprehensive data bases prior to April 2016 . The data analysis was performed by using RevMan version 5.3 . Results  A total of 10 studies with 914 participants were included .  Results showed that  acupuncture  was more  effective  than   conventional medicine therapy ( CMT )  in effectiveness , improvement rate of vertigo and headache , and increased average blood flow velocity of vertebral-basilar artery .  In the subgroup analysis , the results did not change in different acupuncture methods and drug categories substantially . Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results of this meta- analysis were stable . Meanwhile , the  long-term safety of  acupuncture   for  CV  still remains uncertain . GRADE analysis indicated that the quality of evidence for all outcomes was from very low to low which limited the value of the meta- analysis . Conclusion Based on the systematic review ,  acupuncture  appeared to be a promising therapeutic approach for CV based on low or very low quality of evidence . However , large-scale and high- quality trials are required to provide stronger evidence for the conclusion."
" AND IMPLICATION S The review provides an evidence -based guide to future priorities for clinical practice .  Exercise interventions  could reduce the levels of  general  fatigue  in children aged 6 - 18 years .  In particular ,  exercise interventions   for fatigue  are feasible and safe."
"eABSTRACT  Adherence  to prescribed medications continues to be a problem in the treatment of chronic disease .  Motivational interviewing ( MI )  has been shown to be successful for eliciting patients ’  motivations to change  their  medication-taking behaviors .  Due to the constraints of the US healthcare system , patients do not always have in-person access to providers . Because of this , there is increasing use of non-traditional healthcare delivery methods such as telephonic counseling . A systematic review was conducted among published studies of  telephone-based MI interventions  aim ed at improving the  health behavior change  target of medication adherence . The goals of this review were to ( 1 ) examine and describe evidence and gaps in the literature for  telephonically delivered MI interventions  for medication adherence and ( 2 ) discuss the implication s of the findings for research and practice . The MEDLINE , CINAHL , psycINFO , psycARTICLES , Academic Search Premier , Alt HealthWatch , Health Source : Consumer Edition , and Health Source : Nursing/Academic Edition data bases were search ed for peer- review ed research publications between 1991 and October 2012 .  A total of nine articles were retained for review .  The quality of the studies and the interventions varied significantly , which precluded making definitive conclusions but findings among a majority of retained studies suggest that  telephone-based MI  may help improve  medication adherence .  The included studies provided promising results and justification for continued exploration in the provision of  MI  via telephone encounters . Future research is needed to address gaps in the current literature but the results suggest that  MI  may be an  efficient  option for healthcare professionals seeking an evidence -based method to reach remote or inaccessible patients to help them improve their medication adherence."
"DBACKGROUND  Noninvasive ventilation  has been studied as a means of reducing complications among  patients being weaned from  invasive mechanical ventilation .   We sought to summarize evidence comparing  noninvasive and invasive weaning  and their effects on  mortality .  METHODS We identified relevant r and  omized  and quasir and  omized  trials through search es of data bases , conference proceedings and grey literature . We included trials comparing  extubation  and immediate application of  noninvasive ventilation  with  continued invasive weaning  in  adults on mechanical ventilation .  Two review ers each independently screened citations , assessed trial quality and abstract ed data . Our primary outcome was  mortality .  RESULTS We identified  16 trials involving 994 participants , most of whom had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .  Compared with  invasive weaning , noninvasive weaning  significantly reduced  mortality  ( risk ratio [ RR ] 0.53 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.36 to 0.80 ) ,  weaning failures  ( RR 0.63 , 95 % CI 0.42 to 0.96 ) ,  ventilator-associated pneumonia  ( RR 0.25 , 95 % CI 0.15 to 0.43 ) ,  length of stay in the intensive care unit  ( mean difference [ MD ] -5.59 d , 95 % CI -7.90 to -3.28 ) and  in hospital  ( MD -6.04 d , 95 % CI -9.22 to -2.87 ) , and  total duration of mechanical ventilation  ( MD -5.64 d , 95 % CI -9.50 to -1.77 ) .  Noninvasive weaning  had no significant effect on the  duration of ventilation related to weaning  , but significantly reduced  rates of tracheostomy  ( RR 0.19 , 95 % CI 0.08 to 0.47 ) and  reintubation  ( RR 0.65 , 95 % CI 0.44 to 0.97 ) .  Mortality benefits  were significantly greater in trials enrolling  patients with COPD  than in trials enrolling mixed patient population s ( RR 0.36 [ 95 % CI 0.24 to 0.56 ] v. RR 0.81 [ 95 % CI 0.47 to 1.40 ] ) . INTERPRETATION  Noninvasive weaning  reduces  rates of death and pneumonia  without increasing the  risk of weaning failure or reintubation .  In subgroup analyses ,  mortality benefits  were significantly greater in patients with COPD."

" Pool 1 data appeared most consistent for studies of ear acupressure ( EAPR ) vs. non-specific EAPR controls , with confirmed  SC  rates at 3 months post-treatment of 20.0 % for test groups vs. 7.5 % for controls . In Pool 2 the EAP/R interventions appeared neither inferior nor superior to the behavioural interventions at 3 and 6 month follow-ups . However , meta- analysis results derived from relatively small-sized trials with no biochemical validation of SC in Pool 2 . Larger , well-controlled studies using biochemical confirmation of SC are needed."
" : We found evidence that some vaccines are associated with  serious AEs ;  however , these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide."
 Many details of the experimental and comparison interventions in  telehealth-delivered  dietary chronic disease management trials are incompletely reported . This prevents accurate interpretation of trial results and implementation of effective interventions in clinical practice.
" We found insufficient evidence to determine with certainty whether  corticosteroids , surfactants , N-acetylcysteine , statins , or beta-agonists  were effective at reducing  mortality  in  people with ARDS  , or  duration of mechanical ventilation  , or increasing  ventilator-free days .  Three studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review . As the potential long-term consequences of ARDS are important to survivors , future research should incorporate a longer follow-up to measure the impacts on quality of life."
" Calcium supplementation  ( ≥ 1 g/day ) is associated with a  significant reduction in the risk of  pre-eclampsia   , particularly  for women with low calcium diets .  The treatment effect may be overestimated due to small- study effects or publication bias . It also  reduces preterm  birth and the  occurrence of the composite outcome ' maternal death or serious  morbidity ' . We considered these benefits to outweigh the increased  risk of HELLP syndrome  , which was small in absolute numbers . The World Health Organization recommends calcium 1.5 g to 2 g daily for  pregnant women with low dietary calcium intake .  The limited evidence on low-dose  calcium  supplementation suggests a reduction in  pre-eclampsia  , but needs to be confirmed by larger , high- quality trials . Pending such results , in setting s of low dietary calcium where high-dose supplementation is not feasible , the option of lower-dose supplements ( 500 to 600 mg/day ) might be considered in preference to no supplementation."
"sGastric  cancer patients with positive peritoneal cytology as the only marker of metastatic disease  have poor prognoses . There is no universal consensus on the most appropriate treatment regimen for this particular patient group . We review ed and analyzed published data to determine the optimal treatment regimen for  patients with peritoneal cytology-positive gastric adenocarcinomas .  Six electronic data bases were explored [ PubMed , Cochrane ( Systematic Review s and Controlled Trials ) , PROSPERO , DARE , and EMBASE ] . The primary outcome was  overall survival  with secondary outcomes including  patterns of recurrence and treatment-related morbidity .  Six studies were included for data extraction . There was no significant heterogeneity between studies . The use of  S1 monotherapy  was associated with a  significant survival benefit  ( HR 0.48 ; 95 % CI 0.32–0.70 ; p = 0.0002 ) . Intraoperative  intraperitoneal chemotherapy  ( IIPC  ) with adjuvant chemotherapy  showed a trend toward improvement in  overall survival  ( HR 0.70 ; 95 % CI 0.47–1.04 ; p = 0.08 ) . A recent r and omized controlled trial examining   extensive intraperitoneal  lavage  ( EIPL ) with  IIPC  showed a significant improvement in  overall survival  ( 5-year overall survival , 43.8 % for EIPL-IPC group compared with 4.6 % for IPC group ) . However , these promising results need to be vali date d in larger prospect i ve r and omized trials."
" On the basis of evidence in this review it would appear appropriate to offer  OA therapy  to those who are unwilling or unable to persist with  CPAP therapy . N-CPAP  still must be considered the gold st and ard treatment for OSA and , therefore ,  OAs  may be included in the list of alternative options."
" Additional professional support was effective in  prolonging any breastfeeding  , but its effects on  exclusive breastfeeding  were less clear . WHO/UNICEF training courses appeared to be effective for professional training . Additional lay support was effective in  prolonging exclusive breastfeeding  , while its effects on  duration of any breastfeeding  were uncertain . Effective support offered by professionals and lay people together was specific to breastfeeding and was offered to women who had decided to breastfeed . Further trials are required to assess the effectiveness ( including cost-effectiveness ) of both lay  and  professional support in different setting s , particularly those with low rates of breastfeeding initiation , and for  women  who  wish  to  breastfeed  for longer than three months . Trials should consider timing and delivery of support interventions and relative effectiveness of intervention components , and should report women 's views . Research into appropriate training for supporters ( whether lay or professional ) of breastfeeding mothers is also needed."
"eThe role for a single dose of  intravesical chemotherapy ( IVC )  after  transurethral resection  ( TUR ) remains unclear in  patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) .  Several recent r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) have evaluated its effect on  recurrence  , prompting this systematic review of RCTs comparing a single immediate postoperative  dose of IVC versus placebo  within 24 hours of TUR of NMIBC , and this meta- analysis using a r and om-effects model to predict the  pooled relative risk ( RR ) of tumor recurrence .  Subanalyses pooled studies by drug type and a meta-regression was performed to determine the effect of underlying patient risk factors on the efficacy of a single dose of  IVC .   A total of 3103 patients were r and omized in the 18 RCTs that met inclusion criteria .  The  recurrence rate  in patients receiving  perioperative IVC and TUR  was 37 % versus 50 % in the TUR-alone group . The  pooled RR of recurrence  for  IVC  and  TUR  was 0.67 ( 95 % CI , 0.56 - 0.79 ) , corresponding to a 13 % absolute reduction and a number needed to treat of 7.2 patients to avoid 1 recurrence . The proportions of patients with tumor risk factors ( T1 , high- grade , multifocal , or recurrent ) were not associated with  IVC  efficacy . A single dose of  IVC  administered within 24 hours of TUR of NMIBC was found to result in a  reduction in tumor recurrence  ( RR , 0.67 ; 95 % CI , 0.56 - 0.79 ) .  Patients with higher-risk tumor features  seem to benefit at a similar rate."
"sThe aim of this systematic review was to identify the best ways of supporting  people with dementia to eat .  Five electronic data bases were search ed , with a date range from January 2004 to July 2015 . Following screening of the  233 studies identified , 22 were included in the final analysis .  The study interventions focused on   educational programmes , environmental or routine changes  , and  assistance with eating   , with the strongest evidence shown in the more complex educational programmes for people with dementia . The evidence suggests that  staff who support people with dementia to eat  should undertake  face-to-face education programmes  and aim to give people enough time when helping them to eat . However , cultural change may be needed to ensure individual assessment s are carried out to identify those having difficulty eating , and to ensure they are afforded enough time to eat their meals."
"sAlthough the benefits of breastfeeding are widely accepted , the effectiveness of different strategies to promote the continuation of breastfeeding once initiated are less clear . The objective of this systematic review was to describe studies comparing st and ard care with the provision  of extra breastfeeding support  and to measure its  effectiveness .  Outcome measures used were  rates of cessation of any breastfeeding or exclusive breastfeeding  at chosen points in time .  Measures  of  child morbidity and maternal satisfaction  were also used when these were reported .  Twenty eligible r and omised or quasi-r and omised controlled trials were identified , involving 23 712 mother-infant pairs .   Extra support  had a beneficial effect on the  duration of any breastfeeding  ( RR [ 95 % confidence intervals ] for stopping any breastfeeding before the last study assessment up to 6 months 0.88 [ 0.81 , 0.95 ] ; 15 trials , 21 910 women ) . The effect was greater for exclusive breastfeeding ( RR for stopping exclusive breastfeeding before the last study assessment 0.78 [ 0.69 , 0.89 ] ; 11 trials , 20 788 women ) . Although the point estimates of relative risk were very similar , benefit derived from professional support achieved statistical significance for any breastfeeding ( RR 0.89 [ 0.81 , 0.97 ] ; 10 trials , 19 696 women ) but not for exclusive breastfeeding ( RR 0.90 [ 0.81 , 1.01 ] ; six trials , 18 258 women ) . Lay support was effective in reducing the  cessation of exclusive breastfeeding  ( RR 0.66 [ 0.49 , 0.89 ] ; five trials , 2530 women ) while the strength of its effect on any breastfeeding was less clear ( RR 0.84 [ 0.69 , 1.02 ] ; five trials , 2224 women ) . Professional support in the largest trial to assess health outcomes produced a significant  reduction  in  the risk of gastrointestinal infections and atopic eczema .  In two trials with children suffering from diarrhoeal illness ,  extra support  was highly effective in  increasing short-term exclusive breastfeeding rates and reducing recurrence of diarrhoea .  This review supports the conclusion that  supplementary breastfeeding support  should be provided as part of routine health service provision . There is clear evidence for the effectiveness of professional support on the duration of any breastfeeding although the strength of its effect on the rate of exclusive breastfeeding is uncertain . Lay support is effective in promoting exclusive breastfeeding although the strength of its effect on the duration of any breastfeeding is uncertain . Evidence supports the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding as central to the management of diarrhoeal illness in partially breast-fed infants."

"eEven though widely used in today 's clinical practice ,  acupuncture  has remained a controversial subject . Many review s are currently available but most lack a critical stance and some are overtly promotional . The aim of this overview is to provide a balanced , critical analysis of the existing evidence . Some of the original concepts of traditional  acupuncture  are not supported by good scientific evidence . Several plausible theories attempt to explain how  acupuncture  works but none are proved beyond doubt . The clinical  effectiveness  of  acupuncture  continues to attract controversy . Many controlled clinical trials and numerous systematic review s of these studies have been published . Considerable problems are encountered when interpreting these data . Heterogeneity is a significant drawback of both clinical trials and systematic review s. Some of the controversies may be resolved through the use of the new  ' placebo needles '  which enable research ers to adequately control for placebo effects of acupuncture . The majority of studies using such devices fails to show effects beyond a placebo response .  Acupuncture  has been associated with  serious adverse events  but most large-scale studies suggest that these are probably rare .  Nonserious adverse effects  occur in 7 - 11 % of all patients . In conclusion ,  acupuncture  remains steeped in controversy . Some findings are encouraging but others suggest that its clinical  effects  mainly depend on a placebo response."
"eIntervention fidelity refers to strategies that practitioners and research ers use to monitor , enhance , or evaluate the accuracy and consistency of the delivery of an intervention to ensure that it is implemented according to how it was planned . The purpose of the authors in this article was to evaluate intervention fidelity in the  psychosocial oncology intervention effectiveness research  .  Twenty-eight studies located in a previous systematic review on psychosocial oncology intervention effectiveness comprised the sample  for this research . A   treatment fidelity checklist   was applied to each study independently by each author ( MP & PB ) .  Percent agreement  between raters ranged from 68 % to 100 % ( M = 89 % ) . Overall , the  mean proportion of adherence  was 0.57 ( SD 0.12 ) , which may be considered to be moderate fidelity . Critical examination and applicability of the checklist in examining and assessing  intervention fidelity  were highlighted and discussed . Overall ,  intervention fidelity  was adequately addressed in the psychosocial oncology intervention effectiveness research , and integrity was confirmed in the majority of studies review ed . Suggestions for future psychosocial oncology effectiveness research were made."

"OBackground There is a high unmet need for effective treatments for  patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .  Eli Lilly and Company is conducting a phase III , r and omized , multicenter , open-label study of  gemcitabine plus cisplatin plus necitumumab ( GC + N ) versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin ( GC )  for the first-line treatment of  patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC .  Given GC is not the only treatment commonly used for the treatment of squamous NSCLC , this study was design ed to compare the  survival , toxicity , and quality of life outcomes  of current treatment strategies for squamous NSCLC in the first-line setting . Methods / Design A systematic review and meta- analysis ( including indirect comparisons ) of treatments used in squamous NSCLC will be conducted to assess the  clinical efficacy ( overall and progression-free survival ) , health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) , and safety ( grade 3–4 toxicity )  of  GC + N  compared to other treatments used in squamous NSCLC . PRISMA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ) guidelines will be followed for all aspects of this study . A systematic literature review will be conducted to identify r and omized controlled trials evaluating chemotherapy treatment in first-line NSCLC . Eligible articles will be restricted to r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) among  chemotherapy-naïve advanced NSCLC cancer patients  that report  outcome data ( survival , toxicity , or quality of life )  for  patients with squamous histology .  Following data extraction and validation , data consistency and study heterogeneity will be assessed . A network meta- analysis will be conducted based on the  available hazard ratios for overall and progression-free survival , odds ratios for published toxicity data , and mean difference of HRQoL scales .  Sensitivity analyses will be conducted . Discussion This is a presentation of the study protocol only . Results and conclusions are pending completion of this study . Systematic review registration PROSPERO."

"nStreptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterium responsible for a spectrum of diseases including lobar pneumonia , meningitis , otitis media , and sinusitis . Invasive pneumococcal disease is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality across the world . Concerted efforts led to the development of two  vaccinations  ,  Pneumova × 23 and Prevnar 13  , for the prevention of pneumococcal disease . The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice s of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides  vaccination  schedules for  predisposed adults  , but the proposed schedules remain a challenge to health-care providers . We performed a systematic review in PubMed and these specialty group websites to present the pathophysiology of pneumococcal disease , outline different pneumococcal vaccinations , and condense recommendations for vaccination administration."
 There is some weak evidence that oral  midazolam  is an effective sedative agent for  children undergoing dental treatment .  There is very weak evidence that  nitrous oxide inhalation  may also be effective . There is a need for further well design ed and well reported clinical trials to evaluate other potential sedation agents . Further recommendations for future research are described and it is suggested that future trials evaluate experimental regimens in comparison with oral  midazolam  or inhaled nitrous oxide.
"rPancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis particularly in  patients presenting with unresectable tumors .  We performed a bibliometric analysis of clinical trials for  pancreatic cancer  conducted  between 2014 - 2016 focusing on patients that presented with unresectable ( locally advanced or metastatic ) tumors .  We discuss a range of studies that employed  FOLFIRINOX ,  the  gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel combination  and studies that used  molecularly-targeted therapy .  Major areas of focus have been dual targeting of EGFR and VEGFR , immunotherapy or a  multimodal approach – combining chemotherapy with radiotherapy .  We also point out the need for molecular selection for low prevalence subtypes . Key insights source d from these pivotal trials should improve clinical outcomes for this devastating cancer."
"sBackground Despite of the established effectiveness , the acceptance and adherence of cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) remains sub-optimal .  Mobile technologies  are increasingly used in promoting CR without any firm evidence of their safety and efficacy . This systematic review and meta- analysis were aim ed to assess the effect of  mobile applications  as an intervention for improving  adherence to CR .  Methods Relevant studies were search ed in PubMed , the Cochrane Library , Embase and Web of Science from inception to 29th  December  2018 . Eligible studies were the ones which used  mobile applications as a st and -alone intervention  or as  the primary component for  the  intervention  directed at  improving  CR  adherence  , without any limitations on outpatient or home-based CR . Results  Eight studies were eligible for the systematic review  including four r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) as well as four before-after studies of which only one had control group .  Four RCTs and 185 patients in experimental group were included  in meta- analysis , which had evaluated the  effect of  mobile health applications   on  CR completion  and had reported that the  adherence  of patients using  mobile  applications   was 1.4 times higher than the control group ( RR = 1.38 ; CI 1.16 to 1.65 ; P = 0.0003 ) . Moreover , we also found mixed results in  exercise capacity , mental health and quality of life .  Conclusion The use of  mobile applications  for improving the  adherence of the CR  might be effective . However , it appears to be in the initial stage of implementing  mobile applications  in CR and more research is essential to vali date their effectiveness."
"nThe use of  laser light  as an alternative to needles to stimulate acupuncture points has been promoted for almost three decades . However , there has been no systematic assessment of the evidence to support the effectiveness of this form of acupuncture to date . A systematic review was therefore undertaken of RCTs evaluating  laser acupuncture  as a primary intervention .  Relevant studies ( n = 18 )  were identified using computer-based literature search es and selected h and search es . Evidence was found to support the use of  laser acupuncture  in the treatment of  myofascial pain , postoperative nausea and vomiting and for the relief of chronic tension headache .   Laser acupuncture  would appear to represent an effective form of acupuncture for the management of these conditions and could be considered as a viable alternative to more traditional forms of acupuncture point stimulation."
"sBackground  Nakchim  is a kind of  neck pain syndrome  that causes  neck pain and stiffness  without obvious trauma in  East Asian traditional medicine .  We aim ed to summarize and critically evaluate the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of  acupressure  on  nakchim  . Methods We search ed  eight data bases  for studies published up to August 29 , 2017 . Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of  acupressure  on  nakchim  were included . The  acupressure  methods of included studies were divided into  proximal acupressure performed on acupuncture points  located in neck and shoulder , and  distal acupressure performed on acupuncture points  located in other areas .  Overall clinical effective rate ( CER ) and immediately cured rate ( ICR )  , which means rate of the symptom totally resolved after one treatment session , were calculated as mean percentage with 95 % confidence interval . All included studies were assessed for method ological quality . Results  Two case studies and 13 case series with 1037 participants were included  , and 17 types of proximal acupuncture points and 14 types of distal acupuncture points were used . The most commonly used proximal and distal acupuncture points were GB20 and GB39 , respectively . The CER in one study using both proximal and distal acupressure was 100 % . The  CER and ICR  in studies using only proximal acupressure was 95.65 % and 71.61 % , respectively . The  CER and ICR  in studies using only distal acupressure was 99.37 % and 69.08 % , respectively . Eight studies performed  simple acupressure technique  using one acupuncture point , of which SI11 , GB39 , BL57 , and TE3 were used . None of the studies reported  adverse events .  Conclusion This review suggests that  acupressure  may be effective on  nakchim  . However , it is not conclusive due to low method ological quality and low evidence level of included studies."
"sBACKGROUND The value of  nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel ( nab-paclitaxel )  in neoadjuvant systemic therapy for  breast cancer  remains uncertain . METHODS Both electronic data bases and proceedings of oncologic meetings were included in systematic literature search .  Pooled rates of pathological complete response ( pCR ) , odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs )  were calculated using fixed-effect or r and om-effect model to determine the effect of neoadjuvant  nab-paclitaxel .  RESULTS  Twenty-one studies with 2357 patients were included ,  3 of which were  r and  omized  clinical  trials . The  aggregate pCR(ypT0/is  ypN0 )  rate  was 32 % ( 95 % CI 25 - 38 % ) in unselected breast cancer patients and variated in different subtypes . Within r and omized clinical trials , the probability of  achieving pCR  was significantly higher in the nab-paclitaxel group than in the conventional taxanes group ( OR = 1.383 , 95%CI 1.141 - 1.676 , p = 0.001 ) . For  non-hematological toxic effect ,  any  grade and grade 3 - 4 peripheral sensory neuropathy  occurred more frequently with nab-paclitaxel compared to  paclitaxel  ( any grade , OR = 2.090 , 95%CI 1.016 - 4.302 , p = 0.045 ; grade 3 - 4 , OR = 3.766 , 95%CI 2.324 - 6.100 , p < 0.001 )  . Hypersensitivity  was more common with  paclitaxel  than nab-paclitaxel at any grade and grade 3 - 4 .  nab-paclitaxel is an effective cytotoxic drug in neoadjuvant treatment of  breast cancer  , especially for aggressive tumors in terms of pCR . Exchange of nab-paclitaxel for conventional taxanes could significantly improve  pCR rate  with reasonable toxicities."
"nOBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of  hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin  in  newborn infants of mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen .  DESIGN Systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised clinical trials . DATA SOURCES Electronic data bases and h and search es . REVIEW METHODS R and omised clinical trials were assessed for method ological quality . Meta- analysis was undertaken on three outcomes : the  relative risks of hepatitis B occurrence , antibody levels to hepatitis B surface antigen , and adverse events .  RESULTS  29 r and omised clinical trials were identified  , five of which were considered high quality . Only three trials reported inclusion of  mothers negative for hepatitis B e antigen  . Compared with  placebo or no intervention , vaccination  reduced the  occurrence of hepatitis B  ( relative risk 0.28 , 95 % confidence interval 0.20 to 0.40 ; four trials ) . No significant difference in  hepatitis B occurrence  was found between  recombinant vaccine and plasma derived vaccine  ( 1.00 , 0.71 to 1.42 ; four trials ) and between high dose versus  low dose vaccine ( plasma derived vaccine  0.97 , 0.55 to 1.68 , three trials ; recombinant  vaccine  0.78 , 0.31 to 1.94 , one trial ) . Compared with  placebo or no intervention , hepatitis B immunoglobulin  or the  combination of plasma derived vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin  reduced  hepatitis B occurrence  ( immunoglobulin 0.50 , 0.41 to 0.60 , one trial ; vaccine and immunoglobulin 0.08 , 0.03 to 0.17 , three trials ) . Compared with  vaccine alone , vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin  reduced  hepatitis B occurrence  ( 0.54 , 0.41 to 0.73 ; 10 trials ) .  Hepatitis B vaccine  and  hepatitis B immunoglobulin  seem  safe  , but few trials reported  adverse events .    Hepatitis B  vaccine  , hepatitis B immunoglobulin  , and  vaccine plus immunoglobulin  prevent  hepatitis  B occurrence in newborn infants of mothers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen."

"gBackground : A number of  long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)/long-acting β2-agonist ( LABA ) fixed-dose combinations ( FDCs  ) for treatment of moderate-to-very  severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD )  have recently become available , but none have been directly compared in head-to-head r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . The purpose of this study was to assess the relative clinical benefit of all currently available  LAMA/LABA  FDCs using a Bayesian network meta- analysis ( NMA ) . Methods : A systematic literature review identified RCTs investigating the  efficacy , safety  and  quality of  life associated with licensed   LAMA/LABA  FDCs for the treatment of moderate-to-very severe COPD .  RCTs were screened for inclusion in the NMA using prespecified eligibility criteria . Data were extracted for outcomes of interest , including  change in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( tFEV1 ) from baseline , St. George Respiratory Question naire ( SGRQ ) percentage of responders , Transition Dyspnea Index ( TDI ) percentage of responders , change in SGRQ score from baseline , change in TDI focal score from baseline , moderate-to-severe exacerbations , all-cause discontinuation  ,  and discontinuation due to adverse events .  Results : Following screening ,  a total  of  27 trials from 26 publications with 30,361 subjects were eligible for inclusion in the NMA .  Nonsignificant results were seen in most analyses comparing  efficacy , exacerbations and discontinuation rates  of included LAMA/LABA FDCs  ( i.e. aclidinium/formoterol  400/12 µg  , glycopyrronium/indacaterol  110/50 µg ,  tiotropium +  olo date rol 5/5 µg  , umeclidinium/vilanterol  62.5/25 µg ) . Meta-regression controlling for post-bronchodilator  percentage of  tFEV1 predicted at baseline as well as meta-regression adjusting for concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids at baseline was performed to assess the magnitude of effect modification and produced similar results as observed in the base case analysis . Conclusion :  All LAMA/LABA  FDCs were found to have similar  efficacy  and safety . Definitive assessment of the relative efficacy of different treatments can only be performed through direct comparison in head-to-head RCTs . In the absence of such data , this indirect comparison may be of value in clinical and health economic decision-making."
" High- quality evidence indicates  that diet or exercise  , or both , during pregnancy can reduce the risk  of excessive GWG  . Other benefits may include a  lower risk of caesarean delivery , macrosomia , and neonatal respiratory morbidity  , particularly for  high-risk women   receiving combined diet and exercise  interventions  . Maternal hypertension  may also be reduced  . Exercise  appears to be an important part of  controlling weight gain  in pregnancy and more research is needed to establish safe guidelines . Most included studies were carried out in developed countries and it is not clear whether these results are widely applicable to  lower income setting ."
"sBackground The potential role of  ω-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA ) supplementation  during pregnancy on subsequent  risk of  obesity outcomes  in the offspring  is not clear and there is a need to synthesis e this evidence . Objective A systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) , including the most recent studies , was conducted to assess the effectiveness of  ω-3 LCPUFA  interventions during pregnancy on  obesity measures , e.g. BMI , body weight , fat mass in offspring .  Methods Included RCTs had a minimum of 1-month follow-up post-partum . The search included CENTRAL , MEDLINE , SCOPUS , WHO ’s International Clinical Trials Reg . , E-theses and Web of Science data bases . Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration ’s risk of bias tool . Results  Eleven RCTs , from ten unique trials , ( 3644 children )  examined the effectiveness of  ω-3 LCPUFA maternal supplementation  during pregnancy on the  development of obesity outcomes  in  offspring .  There were heterogeneities between the trials in terms of their sample , type and duration of intervention and follow-up . Pooled estimates did not show an association between prenatal intake of fatty acids and  obesity measures  in offspring . Conclusion These results indicate that maternal supplementation with  ω-3 LCPUFA  during pregnancy does not have a beneficial effect  on obesity risk .  Due to the high heterogeneity between studies along with small sample sizes and high rates of attrition , the effects of  ω-3 LCPUFA supplementation  during pregnancy for prevention of  childhood obesity  in the long-term remains unclear . Large high- quality RCTs are needed that are design ed specifically to examine the effect of prenatal intake of fatty acids for prevention of  childhood obesity  . There is also a need to determine specific sub-groups in the population that might get a greater benefit and whether different ω-3 LCPUFA , i.e. eicosapentaenoic ( EPA ) vs. docosahexanoic ( DHA ) acids might potentially have different effects."
"nBACKGROUND Improving HPV vaccination coverage in the US will require healthcare providers to recommend the vaccine more effectively . To inform quality improvement efforts , we systematic ally review ed studies of provider communication about  HPV vaccination .  METHODS We search ed MEDLINE , CINAHL  ,  EMBASE ,  and POPLINE in August 2015  to identify studies of provider communication about  HPV vaccination .  RESULTS  We identified 101 qualitative and quantitative studies .  Providers less often recommended  HPV vaccine  if they were uncomfortable discussing sex , perceived parents as hesitant , or believed patients to be low risk . Patients less often received recommendations if they were younger , male , or from racial/ethnic minorities . Despite parents ' preference for unambiguous recommendations , providers often sent mixed messages by failing to endorse HPV vaccine strongly , differentiating it from other vaccines , and presenting it as an "" optional "" vaccine that could be delayed .  Interventions are needed to help providers deliver effective recommendations in the complex communication environment surrounding HPV vaccination."

"nBACKGROUND Antenatal care of  women with epilepsy  is varied . The association of epilepsy and antiepileptic  drug  exposure with pregnancy outcomes needs to be quantified to guide management . We did a systematic review and meta- analysis to investigate the association between epilepsy and reproductive outcomes , with or without exposure to  antiepileptic drugs  . METHODS We search ed  MEDLINE , Embase , Cochrane , AMED  ,  and CINAHL between Jan 1 , 1990 , and Jan 21 , 2015 , with no language or regional restrictions  , for  observational studies of pregnant women with epilepsy  , which assessed the  risk of obstetric complications  in the antenatal , intrapartum , or postnatal period , and any neonatal complications . We used the  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale  to assess the method ological quality of the included studies , risk of bias in the selection and comparability of cohorts , and outcome . We assessed the odds of  maternal and fetal complications ( excluding congenital malformations  ) by comparing  pregnant women with and without epilepsy  and undertook subgroup analysis based on antiepileptic  drug  exposure  in women with epilepsy .  We summarised the association as odds ratio ( OR ; 95 % CI ) using r and om effects meta- analysis . The PROSPERO ID of this Systematic Review 's protocol is CRD42014007547 . FINDINGS  Of 7050 citations identified , 38 studies from low-income and high-income countries met our inclusion criteria ( 39 articles including 2,837,325 pregnancies ) . Women with epilepsy  versus those without ( 2,809,984 pregnancies ) had increased odds  of spontaneous miscarriage  ( OR 1·54 , 95 % CI 1·02 - 2·32 ; I(2)=67 % ) ,  antepartum haemorrhage  ( 1·49 , 1·01 - 2·20 ; I(2)=37 % ) ,  post-partum haemorrhage  ( 1·29 , 1·13 - 1·49 ; I(2)=41 % )  , hypertensive  disorders ( 1·37 , 1·21 - 1·55 ; I(2)=23 % )  , induction of labour  ( 1·67 , 1·31 - 2·11 ; I(2)=64 %  ) , caesarean section  ( 1·40 , 1·23 - 1·58 ; I(2)=66 %  ) , any preterm birth  ( < 37 weeks of gestation ; 1·16 , 1·01 - 1·34 ; I(2)=64 % )  , and fetal growth  restriction ( 1·26 , 1·20 - 1·33 ; I(2)=1 % ) . The odds of  early preterm birth , gestational diabetes , fetal death or stillbirth , perinatal death , or admission to neonatal intensive care unit  did not differ between women with epilepsy and those without the disorder . INTERPRETATION A small but significant association of epilepsy , exposure to antiepileptic drugs , and adverse outcomes exists in pregnancy . This increased risk should be taken into account when counselling women with epilepsy . FUNDING EBM CONNECT Collaboration."
" With limited evidence and no meta-analyses , as each trial looked at a different comparison , no firm conclusions could be made about different insulin types and regimens in  pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or 2 diabetes .

"d Abstract  There is a strong rationale and many theoretical advantages for  neoadjuvant therapy  in  pancreatic cancer ( PC ) .  However , study results have varied significantly . In this study , a systematic review and meta‐ analysis of prospect i ve studies were performed in order to evaluate  safety and effectiveness  of  neoadjuvant therapy  in PC .  Thirty‐nine studies were selected ( n = 1458 patients ) , with 14 studies focusing on patients with resectable disease ( group 1 ) , and 19 studies focusing on patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced disease ( group 2 ) .   Neoadjuvant chemotherapy  was administered in 97.4 % of the studies , in which 76.9 % was given  radiotherapy  and 74.4 % administered with  chemoradiation .   The complete and partial response rate  was 3.8 % and 20.9 % .  The incidence of grade 3/4 toxicity  was 11.3  % . The overall resection rate   after neoadjuvant therapy  was 57.7 % ( group 1 : 73.0 % , group 2 : 40.2 % ) .  The R0 resection rate  was 84.2 % ( group 1 : 88.2 % , group 2 : 79.4 %  )  .  The overall survival  for all patients was 16.79 months ( resected 24.24 , unresected 9.81 ; group 1 : 17.76 , group 2 : 16.20 ) . Our results demonstrate  that neoadjuvant therapy  has not been proven to be beneficial and should be considered with caution in  patients with resectable PC . Patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced disease  may benefit  from neoadjuvant therapy  , but further research is needed."
"sWe review ed the use of  noninvasive ventilation ( NIV )  versus  high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) oxygen  in  adult acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) .  We search ed major data bases and included r and omized trials comparing at least  NIV with  HFNC   or   NIV+HFNC  with NIV  in  ARF .  Primary outcomes  included intubation/re-intubation rates  . Secondary outcomes  were ICU mortality and morbidities  . Five trials were included ; three compared  HFNC with NIV  , one compared  HFNC , NIV and oxygen  whereas one compared  HFNC+NIV with NIV  .  Patients had hypoxaemic ARF ( PaO2/FiO2⩽300 mmHg ) .  Heterogeneity prevented result pooling . Three and two studies had superiority and noninferiority design , respectively .  Patients were postcardiothoracic surgery , mixed medical/surgical patients and those with pneumonia .  Two trials were conducted after extubation , two before intubation and one during intubation . Three trials  reported intubation/re-intubation rates  as the primary outcomes . The other two trials reported  the lowest peripheral capillary oxygen saturation  readings during bronchoscopy or intubation . In the former three trials , the odds ratio  for intubation/re-intubation rates   between HFNC  versus the  NIV  group ranged from 0.80 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.54–1.19 ) to 1.65 ( 95 % confidence interval : 0.96–2.84 ) . In the latter two trials , only one reported a difference in  the lowest peripheral capillary oxygen saturation   between NIV+HFNC  versus the NIV group during intubation [ 100 % ( interquartile range : 95–100 ) vs. 96 % ( interquartile range : 92–99 ) ; P=0.029 ] . The secondary outcomes  included differences in ICU mortality and patient tolerability  ,  favouring HFNC .  Results were conflicting , but highlighted future research directions . These include  patients with hypercapneic ARF , more severe hypoxaemia ( PaO2/FiO2⩽200 mmHg )  , a superiority design , an oxygen arm and patient-centred outcomes."
"hBACKGROUND AND AIM The European Association of Palliative Care recommends that  family carers  need education on the progression of dementia . This systematic review aim ed to explore whether  interventions incorporating education regarding the progressive nature of dementia  increased carers ' underst and ing of dementia and improved mental health and burden . METHOD MEDLINE , PsycINFO and CINAHL were search ed to April 2018 . R  and omised  controlled trials  with sample s of family carers of someone with dementia were eligible .  Included interventions involved a component aim ed to increase the carer 's underst and ing of the progression of dementia . Outcomes of interest included :  knowledge of dementia , depression , burden and pre-death grief .  RESULTS Search es identified  3221 unique citations of which 11 studies were eligible for review .  Interventions ranged from 4 to 16 sessions of which 1 to 3 sessions focused on the  progression of dementia .   Knowledge  : Two studies evaluated  carers ' knowledge of dementia .  One found no difference between the trial arms immediately after the intervention or three months later . The second found a significant intervention effect at the end of the intervention but not at three-month follow-up .  Depression  : Seven studies evaluated intervention effects on  depression .  Meta- analysis of three trials showed significant differences in  mean follow-up scores  favouring intervention over control . The remaining four studies did not show differences in  depression  between intervention and control groups .  Burden :  Nine studies evaluated  burden  and were examined in two meta-analyses ( mean scores at follow-up and mean change scores from baseline to follow-up ) , neither of which found a benefit for intervention over control . Using the  grading of recommendations assessment , development and evaluation system  , we judged the quality of evidence to be very low for  depression  and low for  burden , knowledge and pre-death grief  , reducing our confidence in any of the effect estimates .  The evidence was not sufficient to support or refute the effectiveness of  education on progression of dementia  on  carers '  knowledge and mental health."
" No r and omised trials compared a policy of immediate  radical radiotherapy  with  palliative radiotherapy  given when patients develop symptoms . In the absence of such trials ,  radical  radiotherapy appears to result in a better  survival  than might be expected had treatment not been given . A substantial , though variable , proportion of patients  died  during follow up from causes other than cancer . The optimal radiation dose and treatment technique ( particularly with respect to mediastinal  irradiation )  remain uncertain."

"yPURPOSE The objective of this systematic review was to describe  nutrition-related  publications on  children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer in Brazil .  METHODS The methodology followed that of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses . Medline , LILACS ( the Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature ) , and Embase were search ed in April 2019 , and data extraction and rating of method ologic study quality ( according to the National Institutes of Health quality score assessment ) were performed independently by review ers . RESULTS  Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria , reporting on 3,509 patients from 1994 to 2018 .  Most of the studies ( 74 % ) were of poor quality in methodology and reporting . Different cancer diagnoses were included in 52 % of studies , whereas acute leukemia was the exclusive focus in 41 % . The majority of the articles ( 70 % ) were from  institutions in the Southeast Region of Brazil , mainly the state of São Paulo ( 74 % ) ; no publications were from the North Region of the country .  Twelve studies addressed  nutritional status and body composition  , reporting an  abundance of malnourished patients  in the  Brazilian population of children and adolescents with cancer .  Six studies on  micronutrients  pointed to possible deficiencies in this population , with a yet unclear but promising role for supplementation during treatment .  Evidence indicates that there is great interest in the impact of nutrition on childhood cancer treatment and clinical outcomes in  Brazil .  However , there is a need to focus on high- quality research , particularly with multicentric/national studies . This will help establish research priorities and better planned clinical interventions , adapted to each region of the country."
"nAIM To assess the prevalence of  functional gastrointestinal  disorders  ( FGIDs ) in children and adolescents .  METHODS PubMed , EMBASE , and Scopus data bases were search ed for original articles from inception to September 2016 . The literature search was made in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) recommendations . For inclusion , each study had to report  epidemiological data on FGIDs in children between 4 and 18 years old and contain st and ardized outcome based on Rome II , III or IV criteria .  The  overall  quality of included epidemiological studies was evaluated in accordance with Loney ’s proposal for prevalence studies of health literature . Two review ers assessed each study for data inclusion and extraction . Discrepancies were reconciled through discussion with seniors . RESULTS A total of  659 articles were identified from the data bases  and 16 through manual search . A total of 43  articles  fulfilled the eligibility criteria for full-text reading , with 26 remaining to be included in the final analysis . All studies were written in English and published between  2005 and 2016  . Eight ( 30.8 % ) articles were performed in North America , five ( 19.2 % ) in Latin America , five ( 19.2 % ) in Europe , seven ( 27 % ) in Asia , and one ( 3.8 % ) in Africa  . Sample size varied between 114 and 99416 subjects , totaling 132600 individuals . Fourteen ( 53.9 % ) studies recruited their target sample s from schools , 11 ( 42.3 % ) from healthcare setting s and the remaining one ( 3.8 % ) from online panel community .  The  overall FGID prevalence rates  for  student sample s  ranged from 9.9 % to 29 % to as high as 87 % in clinical sample s.  Cyclic vomiting , irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation  were the most research ed conditions , with a prevalence ranging from 0.2 % to 6.2 % , 0 % to 45.1 % and 0.5 % to 86.9 % , respectively . The qualitative appraisal revealed that most of the studies showed average or below average generalizability .  The heterogeneity of the studies on FGIDs must be improved in order to allow comparison . Improvements should include appropriate sampling of representative population , comparable study setting , and consistent data collection."

Nevertheless , it may be preferable to lose weight through a  combination of diet and exercise  as this improves  maternal cardiorespiratory fitness  and preserves  fat-free mass  , while  diet  alone reduces  fat-free mass .  This needs confirmation in large trials of high method ological quality . For  women who are breastfeeding  , more evidence is required to confirm whether  diet  or  exercise  , or both , is not detrimental for either mother or baby."
" Intraoperative  PRP  reduces the  failure risk   following rotator cuff repair  and has a consistent effect regardless of tear size . However , because of the variability in  PRP  preparations , a specific recommendation can not be made."
" Evidence shows that packages of care are effective in reducing  the risk of most adverse perinatal outcomes  . However , trials often include  few women  , are poorly reported with unclear or high risk of bias and report few outcomes . The contribution of each treatment within the packages of care remains unclear . Large well- design ed and well-conducted trials are urgently needed .

 Cow 's milk consumption in infancy is associated with an increased  risk of developing Fe-deficiency anaemia  . Limiting cow 's milk consumption may be important to ensure an adequate Fe intake for  infants and toddlers .  High- quality patient information for caregivers is needed on how infants ' Fe requirements can be met.
" Overall our study supports the use of  anti-IL-5 treatments  as an adjunct to st and ard of care in  people with severe eosinophilic asthma and poor control .  These treatments roughly halve the rate of  asthma exacerbations  in this population . There is limited evidence for improved  HRQoL scores and lung function  , which may not meet clinical ly detectable levels . There were no safety concerns regarding mepolizumab or reslizumab , and no excess serious adverse events with benralizumab , although there remains a question over adverse events significant enough to prompt discontinuation . Further research is needed on biomarkers for assessing  treatment  response ,  optimal duration and long-term effects of treatment , risk of relapse on withdrawal  ,  non-eosinophilic patients , children ( particularly under 12 years ) , and  comparing  anti-IL-5  treatments to each other and , in people eligible for both , to anti-immunoglobulin E. For  benralizumab  , future studies should closely monitor  rates of adverse events  prompting discontinuation."
" Due to the limited number of studies available comparing various interface types , the optimum form of CPAP delivery interface remains unclear . The results of our review suggest that  nasal pillows or the Oracle oral mask  may be useful alternatives when a patient is unable to tolerate conventional nasal masks . The  face  mask can not be recommended as a first line interface , but may be considered if  nasal obstruction or dryness  limits the use of a nasal mask . Further r and omised studies comparing the different forms of CPAP delivery interface now available for the treatment of OSA , in larger groups of patients and for longer duration s , are required."
 Circulating RBP4 levels  may not be associated with NAFLD . Further prospect i ve cohort studies are required to confirm these findings.
" The use of intravenous  aminophylline  did not result in significant  additional bronchodilation  compared to st and ard care with inhaled beta(2)-agonists in  patients experiencing  an  asthma exacerbation  in the ED setting , or in a significant reduction in the  risk of hospital admission .  For every  100 people  treated with  aminophylline  an additional 20 people had  vomiting  and 15 people  arrhythmias or palpitations .  No subgroups in which  aminophylline  might be more effective were identified . Our up date in 2012 is consistent with the original conclusions that the risk-benefit balance of intravenous  aminophylline  is unfavourable."
"sPurpose of review Maternal and  child  malnutrition continues to disproportionately affect low and middle-income countries , contributing to high rates of morbidity , mortality , and suboptimal development . This article review s evidence from recent systematic review s and studies on the effectiveness of interventions to improve nutritional status in these  especially vulnerable population s.  Recent findings  Macronutrients  provided to  expectant mothers  in the form of  balanced protein energy supplements  can improve  fetal growth and birth outcomes  , and new research suggests that  lipid nutrient  supplements can reduce both  stunting and wasting  in newborns . Maternal  multiple micronutrient supplementations  can also improve  fetal growth  , and reduce  the risk of stillbirth .   Nutrition education and supplementation  provided to pregnant adolescents can also improve  birth outcomes  in this vulnerable population . New evidence is broadening our underst and ing of the development of gut microbiota in  malnourished infants  , and the possible protective role of breastmilk . Summary The review ed evidence on nutrition interventions reinforces the importance of packaging interventions delivered within critical windows throughout the life course : before conception , during pregnancy , and throughout childhood . Emerging evidence continues to refine our underst and ing of which population s and context s benefit from which intervention components , which should allow for more nuanced and tailored approaches to the implementation of nutrition interventions."
" : Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional evidence ,  cancer survivors  can experience symptoms for more than 10 years following treatment . These symptoms were present in  survivors of  all  four cancer types who underwent  a wide  variety of treatment  . The results indicate that these symptoms should be evaluated and managed to optimize long-term outcomes."
"gTiotropium is now delivered via two different inhaler devices : the original  H and ihaler  18 μg once daily , which uses a powder formulation ; and the newer  Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler ( SMI  ) 5 μg once daily . It has been question ed whether the two devices can be assumed to have the same safety profile , although the TIOSPIR trial showed that  tiotropium  when administered via  Respimat  SMI 5 μg is not less safe than  H and ihaler  18 μg . Therefore , we have carried out a  safety  evaluation of  tiotropium H and ihaler 18 µg versus tiotropium Respimat SMI 5 µg and 2.5 µg  , via systematic review and network meta- analysis of the currently available clinical evidence . The results of our meta- analysis with an extremely large number of  patients  analysed demonstrate that  the safety profile   of tiotropium H and iHaler  is generally superior to that of  tiotropium Respimat SMI  , although  no  statistical difference was detected between these two devices . However , the SUCRA analysis favoured  tiotropium Respimat SMI  with  regards to serious adverse events ( AEs )  . We do not believe that  using Respimat  SMI rather that  H and  iHaler exposes patients to  higher risks of real AEs  . Rather , we believe that there may be a  different cardiovascular ( CV ) response  to muscarinic receptors blockage in individual patients . Therefore , it will be essential to make all possible efforts to proactively identify patients at increased  risk of CV AEs  when  treated with tiotropium  or another antimuscarinic drug."
" The results indicate that there may be some benefits of some  nutritional factors  to prevent GDM . However , better- design ed studies are required to generate higher quality evidence . At the moment , no strong conclusions can be drawn with regard to the best intervention for the prevention of GDM."
" Both  OS and PFS  were improved with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy .  Although the effects were less clear on all other pre-specified outcomes , they all tended to be in favour of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy .  Whilst these results appear to indicate that  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  may offer a benefit over surgery alone for  women with early-stage or locally-advanced cervical cancer  , the evidence is based on only a small number of trials , and further research may be warranted."
" Glucose infusion rate : There is insufficient evidence from trials comparing lower with higher glucose infusion rates to inform clinical practice . Large r and omized trials are needed , powered on clinical outcomes including  death , major morbidities and adverse neurodevelopment .   Insulin infusion :  The evidence review ed does not support the routine use of  insulin  infusions to prevent hyperglycemia in VLBW neonates . Further r and omized trials of  insulin  infusion may be justified . They should enrol  extremely low birth weight neonates  at very high risk for  hyperglycemia  and  neonatal death .  They might use real time glucose monitors if these are vali date d for clinical use . Refinement of algorithms to guide insulin infusion is needed to enable tight control of glucose concentrations within the target range."
" : The findings indicate that there is no evidence for the positive effect of  psychoeducational interventions  on these outcomes , warranting further RCT studies design ed to target on these outcomes."
" The current evidence is insufficient for assessing the effects of reducing the protein concentration in infant formulas on long-term outcomes , but , if confirmed , this could be a promising intervention for reducing the risk  of overweight and obesity   in children .  In view of the limited available evidence , more studies replicating effects on long-term health outcomes are needed."
"yInfluenza causes substantial  mortality  in high-risk groups despite targeted vaccination programmes . This paper considers whether it is worth   vaccinating  healthcare  workers  ( HCWs )  against influenza   to  protect high-risk patients  in a series of systematic review s and an economic evaluation .  Eighteen studies are included .   Vaccination  was highly effective in HCWs , with minimal  adverse effects .  Two trials assessed  patient mortality  after vaccinating HCWs , both of which showed a reduction . Despite recommendations , less than 25 % of HCW in  Europe  and the  UK  are vaccinated . Five studies looked at programmes to increase  uptake ;  these produced increases of 5%-45 % . Published economic evaluations did not include patient benefit ; therefore , an economic evaluation using UK data was undertaken . In the base case ,  vaccination  was  cost saving  ( pounds 12/vaccinee ) . In the most pessimistic scenario it cost pounds 405/life-year gained . Effective implementation should be a priority."
" We can conclude , mostly based on moderate quality evidence , that non-disease activity guided dose reduction of etanercept 50 mg weekly to 25 mg weekly , after at least three to 12 months of low disease activity , seems as effective as continuing the st and ard dose with respect to  disease activity and functional outcomes  , although dose reduction significantly induces minimal and not clinical ly meaningful differences in  radiological progression .  Discontinuation ( also without disease activity-guided adaptation ) of adalimumab and etanercept is inferior to continuation of treatment with respect to  disease activity and radiological outcomes and function .  Disease activity-guided dose tapering of adalimumab and etanercept seems slightly inferior to continuation of treatment with respect to  disease activity  , with no difference in  function .  However the only study investigating this comparison included lower than projected numbers of participants .Caveats of this review are that available data are limited . Also , the heterogeneity between studies and the suboptimal design choices ( including absence of disease activity-guided dose reduction and discontinuation and use of superiority design s ) limit definitive conclusions . None of the included studies assessed  long-term safety and costs  , although these factors are specific reasons why clinicians consider lowering the dose or stopping the administration of anti-TNF agents . Future research should include other anti-TNF agents ; assessment of  disease activity , function and radiographic outcomes  after longer follow-up ; and assessment of  long-term safety , cost-effectiveness  and predictors for successful down-titration . Also use of a vali date d flare criterion , non-inferiority design s and disease activity-guided instead of fixed-dose tapering or stopping would allow research ers to better interpret study findings and generalise the information to clinical practice."
"LExtranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma ( ENKTL ) , nasal type , presents predominantly as a localized disease involving the nasal cavity and adjacent sites , and the treatment of localized nasal ENKTL is a major issue . However , given its rarity , there is no st and ard therapy based on r and omized controlled trials and therefore a lack of consensus on the treatment of localized nasal ENKTL . Currently recommended treatments are based mainly on the results of phase II studies and retrospective analyses . Because the previous outcomes of  anthracycline-containing chemotherapy  were poor ,  non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens  ,  including etoposide and l-asparaginase  , have been used mainly for  patients with localized nasal ENKTL .   Radiotherapy  also has been used as a main component of treatment because it can produce a  rapid response .  Accordingly , the combined approach of  non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy with radiotherapy  is currently recommended as a first-line treatment for localized nasal ENKTL . This review summarizes the different approaches for the use of  non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy with radiotherapy including concurrent , sequential , and s and wich chemoradiotherapy  , which have been proposed as a first-line treatment for newly diagnosed patients with localized nasal ENKTL."
 No r and omized controlled trials that assessed the  effectiveness or safety  of  oral immunoglobulin preparations  for the treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in  hospitalized low birth weight infants  were found . Clinical trials that address the issue of  oral immunoglobulin  treatment of rotavirus infection are needed.
" This review demonstrates that there is no evidence from r and omised controlled trials evaluating the effect  of baby-led compared with scheduled ( or mixed ) breastfeeding  for successful breastfeeding , for  healthy newborns .  It is recommended that no changes are made to current practice guidelines without undertaking robust research , to include many patterns of breastfeeding and not limited to baby-led and scheduled breastfeeding . Future exploratory research is needed on baby-led breastfeeding that takes the mother 's perspective into consideration."
" The limited evidence available is low quality and suggests that face to face  interventions  to inform or educate parents about childhood vaccination have little to no impact on immunisation status , or knowledge or underst and ing of vaccination . There is insufficient evidence to comment on the  cost of implementing the intervention  ,  parent intention to vaccinate , parent experience of the intervention  , or  adverse effects .  Given the apparently limited effect of such interventions , it may be feasible and appropriate to incorporate communication about vaccination into a healthcare encounter , rather than conduct it as a separate activity."
 Evidence is insufficient to suggest that  non-pharmacological treatments  are effective in reducing  chronic  pain  in people living with SCI .  The benefits and harms of commonly used  non-pharmacological pain treatments  should be investigated in r and omised controlled trials with adequate sample size and study methodology.
" The current state of the evidence favours  acupuncture , laser  and  intermittent traction  for  chronic neck pain .  Some electrotherapies show little benefit for  chronic neck pain .  Consistent dosage , improved design and long term follow-up continue to be the recommendations for future research."
"IPurpose This paper aims to review the current evidence for   autologous chondrocyte implantation ( ACI )   generations relative to other treatment modalities , different cell delivery methods and different cell source application . Methods Literature search was performed to identify all  level I and II studies reporting  the  clinical and structural outcome of any ACI generation in human knees  using the following medical electronic data bases : PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , CINAHL , SPORTD iscus and NICE healthcare data base . The level of evidence , sample size calculation and risk of bias were determined for all included studies to enable quality assessment . Results  Twenty studies were included in the analysis , reporting on a total of 1094 patients .  Of the 20 studies , 13 compared  ACI  with other treatment modalities , seven compared different  ACI cell delivery methods  , and one compared different  cell source for implantation .  Studies included were heterogeneous in baseline design , preventing meta- analysis . Data showed a trend towards similar outcomes when comparing ACI generations with other repair techniques and when comparing different cell delivery methods and cell source selection . Majority of the studies ( 80 % ) were level II evidence , and overall the quality of studies can be rated as average to low , with the absence of power analysis in 65 % studies . Conclusion At present , there are insufficient data to conclude any superiority of ACI techniques . Considering its two-stage operation and cost , it may be appropriate to reserve  ACI  for patients with larger defects or those who have had inadequate response to other repair procedures until hard evidence enables specific clinical recommendations be made . Level of evidence II."

"gUNLABELLED Scientific literature is increasingly reporting on dietary deficiencies in  many population  s of some nutrients critical for  foetal and infant brain development and function  . PURPOSE To highlight the potential benefits of maternal supplementation with  docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA )  and other important complimentary  nutrients  , including  vitamin D , folic acid and iodine  during pregnancy and /or breast feeding for foetal and /or infant brain development and /or function . METHODS English language systematic review s , meta-analyses , r and omised controlled trials , cohort studies , cross-sectional and case-control studies were obtained through search es on MEDLINE and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials from January 2000 through to February 2012 and reference lists of retrieved articles . Reports were selected if they included benefits  and  harms of maternal supplementation  of DHA , vitamin D , folic acid or iodine supplementation  during pregnancy and /or lactation . RESULTS Maternal  DHA  intake during pregnancy and /or lactation can prolong  high risk pregnancies  , increase  birth weight , head circumference and birth length  , and can enhance  visual acuity , h and and eye co-ordination , attention , problem solving and information processing .   Vitamin  D helps maintain  pregnancy  and promotes  normal skeletal and brain development .  Folic acid is necessary for  normal foetal spine , brain and skull development .  Iodine is essential for  thyroid hormone production  necessary for  normal brain and nervous system development  during gestation that impacts childhood function .  Maternal supplementation within recommended safe intakes in population s with dietary deficiencies may prevent many  brain and central nervous system malfunctions  and even enhance  brain development and function  in their offspring."
 This extensive trial data set enabled assessment of  effects on neurocognitive illness and cognitive decline  not previously adequately assessed . Long-chain omega-3 probably has little or no effect  on new neurocognitive outcomes or cognitive impairment  . IMPLICATION S  Long-chain omega-3 supplements  do not help  older adults  protect  against cognitive decline .
 These findings confirm that  effectiveness  of   LAIV   against A(H1N1)pdm09 strains has been lower than IIV  .  A systematic investigation has been initiated to determine the root cause of the difference in effectiveness between pre- and postp and emic A(H1N1 ) vaccine strains and to identify a more consistently effective A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain.
"sABSTRACT  Postnatal depression  ( PND ) is a common disorder that can be profoundly disabling for  affected mothers and their infants  . We review ed published articles on the  community-based  management of PND in  developing countries  . Our aim was to propose recommendations to help  women with PND .  Various data bases were search ed for  English articles from 2000 to 2014 . Twelve articles met  the selection criteria . We found that interventions involving  cognitive behavioral therapy , infant stimulation  , and  problem solving  can improve  outcomes for PND .  Challenges to implementation included :  dependence on specific cadres of health workers ; motivation and capacity of delivery agents for additional responsibilities ; high level of supervision required ;  and  lack of structures  and  mechanisms  to  ensure fidelity .  Recommendations are proposed that can potentially assist future efforts at addressing PND in  women  , especially in developing countries . Further research is required to address these gaps."
"wPurpose There is an increasing body of evidence underpinning  high-intensity exercise  as an effective and time-efficient intervention for  improving  health  in cancer survivors .  The aim of this study was to , ( 1 ) evaluate the  efficacy  and ( 2 )  the safety  of  high-intensity exercise interventions  in improving  selected health outcomes  in  cancer survivors .  Methods Design Systematic review . Data sources Google Scholar and EBSCO , CINAHL Plus , Computers and Applied Sciences Complete , Health Source —Consumer Edition , Health Source : Nursing/Academic Edition , MEDLINE , Web of Science and SPORTD iscuss from inception up until August 2017 . Eligibility criteria  R and omized controlled  trials of   high-intensity exercise interventions  in cancer survivors ( all cancer types ) with health-related outcome measures  . The guidelines adopted for this review were the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta- Analysis ( PRISMA ) . Results  The search returned 447 articles , of which nine articles ( n = 531 participants mean , age 58 ± 9.5 years ) met the eligibility criteria  .  Exercise interventions  of between 4 and 18 weeks consisting of high-intensity interval bouts of up to 4-min were compared with  a continuous moderate intensity ( CMIT ) intervention or a control group . High-intensity exercise interventions  elicited significant  improvements in VO2 max , strength , body mass , body fat and hip and waist circumference  compared with CMIT and /or control groups . The studies review ed showed low risk in participating in  supervised high-intensity exercise interventions  . Mixed  mode high-intensity interventions  which included both  aerobic and resistance exercises  were most effective  improving the aerobic fitness levels  of cancer survivors by 12.45–21.35 % , from baseline to post-intervention .  Conclusion High-intensity exercise  interventions  improved physical and physiological health-related outcome measures such as cardiovascular fitness and strength  in cancer survivors . Given that high-intensity exercise sessions require a shorter time commitment , it may be a useful modality to  improve health  outcomes in those who are time poor . The risk of adverse events associated  with high-intensity  exercise was low."
"dAim This literature study explores the impact of  educational interventions about medicines  for  psychiatric patients  on adherence , knowledge and economic , clinical and humanistic outcomes . Method A systematic review of eight electronic data bases was carried out . Reference lists of primary studies were search ed . Studies measuring the impact of  medication information  for  adult psychiatric patients  in an individual way on adherence , knowledge , economic , clinical and humanistic outcomes were included . Data analysis and assessment of method ological  quality  were executed according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines . A meta- analysis of primary studies was not suitable due to the heterogeneity of the primary studies . Results Literature search  generated 17 studies .  Thirteen studies measured adherence , seven of which reported an  increase .  Generally ,  adherence  was 11–30 % higher in the intervention groups than in the control group . A combination of oral and written information seemed to have an added value as compared with supplying exclusively oral or written information . The provision of easily readable written information improved  adherence  by 11 % . Seven of the eight studies measuring  knowledge  reported an  overall improvement . Knowledge  was increased with 14–28 % in interventions groups in comparison with control group . One study reported an  increased satisfaction .  No significant differences were seen  for frequency of side-effects , relapse or admission rates , symptoms and quality of life .  Not one of the 17 studies explored the  economic impact  of the  educational intervention .  The method ological quality of the included studies was variable . Individual studies suffered from a variety of biases and other method ological limitations . Conclusion The included studies suggested a positive impact  on adherence and knowledge .  As only one study assessed  patient ’s satisfaction  , no definitive conclusions can be made . No significant differences were  observed for frequency of side-effects , relapse or admission rates , symptoms and quality of life .  Studies on the cost-effectiveness of such interventions need to be performed . In general , more well- design ed studies with good method ological quality in this research domain are needed."
"sThis systematic review evaluates the evidence underpinning the provision of   palliative day care services ( PDS )   to determine whether such services have a measurable effect on  attendees ’  wellbeing . The majority of studies review ed were qualitative and elicited individual perceptions of the benefits PDS . Although it was difficult to determine the quality of many studies , it would appear that attendance at  PDS  had a positive impact on attendees ’  quality of life .  Fewer studies utilized vali date d outcome measures to determine the effect of  PDS  on attendees ’ wellbeing and small sample sizes combined with high attrition rates influenced the significance of some the results . However little quantitative evidence was offered to prove that  PDS  had an impact on  attendees ’ quality of life or wellbeing .  The review concludes that  dying people  find  attending  PDS   a valuable experience that allows them to engage with others and to be supported in a restorative environment . However , further well-powered empirical studies are required to provide quality evidence to determine whether or not attendance at  PDS  does indeed have a positive impact on the  wellbeing  of attendees."
" Among the 24 instruments for the assessment of  pMDI administration technique in children  that were identified and systematic ally examined , four were considered to be the best ones available . However , additional evaluation of their measurement properties should be done before using them in clinical practice and for research purpose."
"PBackground The aim of this investigation was to compare  ventilation at different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP )  with regard to clinical important outcomes of  intensive care unit ( ICU ) patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) at onset of ventilation .  Methods Meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) comparing a  lower level of PEEP  with  a higher level of PEEP  was performed . The primary outcome was  in-hospital mortality  . Results  Twenty-one RCTs ( 1393 patients ) were eligible .   PEEP  ranged from 0 to 10 cmH2O and from 5 to 30 cmH2O in the lower PEEP and the higher PEEP arms of included  RCTs  ,  respectively . In-hospital mortality  was not different between the two PEEP arms in seven RCTs ( risk ratio [ RR ] 0.87 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.62–1.21 ; I2 = 26 % ,  low quality of evidence [ QoE  ] ) , as  was duration of mechanical ventilation  in three RCTs ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] 0.68 ; 95 % CI −0.24 to 1.61 ; I2 =  82 %  ,  very low QoE ) . PaO2/FiO2  was higher in the higher PEEP arms in five RCTs ( SMD 0.72 ; 95 % CI 0.10–1.35 ; I2 =  86  % ,  very low QoE ) . Development of ARDS and the occurrence of hypoxemia  ( 2 RCTs ) were lower in the higher PEEP arms in four RCTs and two RCTs , respectively ( RR 0.43 ; 95 % CI 0.21–0.91 ; I2 = 56 % , low QoE ; RR 0.42 ; 95%–CI 0.19–0.92 ; I2 = 19 % , low QoE ) . There was no association between  the level of PEEP  and  any  hemodynamic parameter ( four RCTs ) . Conclusion Ventilation with higher levels  of  PEEP  in ICU patients without ARDS at  onset  of ventilation  was not associated  with lower in-hospital mortality or shorter duration of ventilation  , but with a  lower incidence of ARDS and hypoxemia  , as well as  higher  PaO2/FiO2 . These findings should be interpreted with caution , as heterogeneity was moderate to high , the  QoE  was low to very low , and the available studies prevented us from addressing the effects of moderate levels of PEEP."
" There was insufficient evidence to support the use of ultrasound , infrared light or transillumination . Interventions to reduce  children 's  pain did not decrease  first attempt success  . Research examining between-clinician proficiency and persistence differences is absent."
" Although  PRP  is considered a cheap and patient 's derived growth factor , the not conclusive data reported would suggest that its use in addition to bone substitutes could be of some clinical benefit in the regenerative treatment of infrabony defects . Clinical Relevance This systematic review was intended to sort out the huge controversial debate in the field about the possible use of  PRP  in regenerative surgery in  infrabony defect .  The clinical relevance of using blood-borne growth factors to conventional procedures is effective as these could determine a better performance and outcomes despite the surgical approach adopted and limit the use of additional bio material s for the blood clot stabilization."
" Consideration of a  psychological or psychosocial intervention  over and above treatment as usual is worthwhile ; with the public health benefits of ensuring that this practice is widely adopted potentially worth the investment . However , the specific type and nature of the intervention that should be delivered is not yet clear  . Cognitive-behavioural therapy or interventions with  an interpersonal focus and targeted on the precipitants to self-harm may be the best c and i date s on the current evidence . Further research is required."
" There is a need to develop further strategies besides  chemotherapy  to improve the  outcomes  in pancreatic cancer treatment . Future studies should consider surgical interventions ,  combination chemotherapy  , and individualized second-line treatment based on the prior chemotherapy."
" The evidence from this review suggests that  MMN  fortification when compared to  placebo/no  intervention may reduce  anaemia , iron deficiency anaemia and micronutrient deficiencies  ( iron , vitamin A , vitamin B2 and vitamin B6 ) . We are uncertain of the effect of  MMN  fortification on  anthropometric measures  ( HAZ/LAZ , WAZ and WHZ/WLZ ) . There are no data to suggest possible adverse effects of  MMN  fortification , and we could not draw reliable conclusions from various subgroup analyses due to a limited number of studies in each subgroup . We remain cautious about the level of commercial funding in this field , and the possibility that this may be associated with higher effect estimates , although subgroup analysis in this review did not demonstrate any impact of commercial funding . These findings are subject to study limitations , imprecision , high heterogeneity and small sample sizes , and we rated most of the evidence low to very low quality . and hence no concrete conclusions could be drawn from the findings of this review."
"  In asthmatic adults inadequately controlled on low doses of inhaled steroids  , the addition of LABA is superior to LTRA for preventing exacerbations requiring systemic steroids , and for improving  lung function  , symptoms , and the use of rescue beta(2)-agonists."
" These data support the concept that in  adequately selected patients  ,  VBT  alone may be a suitable radiotherapy technique in  women with stage I USC  who underwent surgical staging and received adjuvant chemotherapy."
"wThere is almost universal agreement that the quality of clinical trials of acupuncture is poor . There is an urgent need to improve their quality . The author develops here a list of 45 criteria important in the design , implementation , and writing up of controlled clinical   acupuncture   trials . This list has been compiled after examining the  quality assessment criteria  used in meta-analyses and systematic review s of acupuncture , general publications on clinical trial design s and method ological considerations specific to  acupuncture  trials . Each criterion is discussed with recommendations about use and implementation . Additionally , each criterion is discussed relative to their importance in three types of   acupuncture   trial ,  acupuncture versus sham acupuncture , acupuncture versus st and ard therapy  and  acupuncture versus no treatment or wait-list .  It is hoped that this exploration and systematic presentation of the 45 criteria will contribute to improving the quality of clinical trials of acupuncture . Improved trial quality will lead to greater ease interpreting the results of trials , especially in systematic review."
"sHead  and neck cancer ( HNC )  is a fatal malignancy with an overall long-term survival of about 50 % for all stages . The diagnosis is not rarely delayed , and the majority of patients present with loco-regionally advanced disease . The rate of second primary tumors after a diagnosis of HNC is about 3–7 % per year , the highest rate among solid tumors . Currently , a  single-modality  or a  combination of surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy ( CHT )  , is the st and ard treatment for stage III – IV HNC . For the recurrent/metastatic setting , in the last 40 years great efforts have been made in order to develop a more effective  CHT  regimen , from the use of  methotrexate  alone , to  the combination of cisplatin ( CDDP ) and 5-fluorouracile ( 5FU ) or paclitaxel .  Recently , the introduction of  cetuximab  , an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody , to  the CDDP–5FU doublet ( EXTREME regimen )  has  improved the overall response rate , the progression-free survival and the overall survival ( OS )  compared to  CHT  alone . Nowadays , the EXTREME regimen is the st and ard of care for the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic head and neck carcinoma ( RMHNC ) . In the last years , new promising therapies for RMHNC such as  immune checkpoint inhibitors  ( ICIs ) , which have demonstrated favorable results in second-line clinical trials , gained special interest .  Nivolumab  and  pembrolizumab  are the first two ICIs able to  prolong OS  in the second- , later-line and platinum-refractory setting , with  tolerable toxicities .  This review summarizes the current state of the art in RMHNC treatment options."
">The growing mental health needs of  students within schools  have result ed in  teachers  increasing their involvement in the delivery of  school-based , psychosocial interventions .  Current research reports mixed findings concerning the effectiveness of  psychosocial interventions  delivered by  teachers for mental health outcomes  . This article presents a systematic review and meta- analysis that examined the effectiveness of   school-based  psychosocial interventions delivered by  teachers  on internalizing and externalizing outcomes  and the moderating factors that influence treatment effects on these outcomes .  Nine electronic data bases  , major journals , and gray literature ( e.g. , websites , conference abstract ) were search ed and field experts were contacted to locate additional studies .  Twenty-four studies that met  the  study  inclusion criteria were coded into internalizing or externalizing outcomes and further analyzed using robust variance estimation in meta-regression . Both publication and risk of bias of studies were further assessed . The results showed statistically significant  reductions in students ’ internalizing outcomes  ( d = .133 , 95 % CI [ .002 , .263 ] ) and no statistical significant effect  for externalizing outcomes  ( d = .15 , 95 % CI [ −.037 , .066 ] ) . Moderator analysis with meta-regression revealed that gender ( %  male  , b = −.017 , p < .05 ) , race ( % Caucasian , b = .002 , p < .05 ) , and the tier of intervention ( b = .299 , p = .06 ) affected intervention effectiveness . This study builds on existing literature that shows that teacher-delivered Tier 1 interventions are  effective  interventions but also adds to this literature by showing that  interventions are more effective with internalizing outcomes than on the externalizing outcomes .  Moderator analysis also revealed  treatments were more effective with  female students  for internalizing outcomes and more effective with  Caucasian students  for externalizing outcomes ."
"yAbstract The effect of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  on the  survival  of  patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas ( ESCCs )  remains controversial . The optimal management strategy for resectable ESCCs varies regionally based on local r and omized controlled trials . A systematic review and meta- analysis was conducted to re-evaluate this controversial issue . A systematic review of the Medline , Embase , and PubMed data bases was carried out on data collected between August 1994 and August 2014 to evaluate the role of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy .  Only r and omized controlled trials comparing the effects of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  with that of  surgery and surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy  were selected .  Six studies with a total of 1202 patients were identified , consisting of a  neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm  ( n = 597 ) and a  surgery alone and surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy arm  ( n = 605 ) .  The  5-year overall survival  benefit for  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  was statistically significant at & agr ; = 0.1 ( hazard ratio = 0.81 , 95 % confidence intervals , 0.65–1.00 , P = 0.053 ) . All 6 trials  recruited patients for more than 5 years with undefined lymphadenectomies .   Cisplatin and fluorouracil  were adopted as  neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens .  The role of  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  for ESCC is worth re-investigating . The design of r and omized controlled trials should adopt new chemotherapy regimens as well as define the surgical procedure and the details of the lymphadenectomy."
" AND IMPLICATION S It is important to consider how making  broad dietary recommendations  for all individuals might affect overall  QOL  in both positive and negative directions when considering factors other than weight loss and health improvement . If  dietary interventions  are adversely affecting QOL in other domains ( eg , social , economic ) and this relationship is not being detected or reported by current research practice s , barriers for successful and sustainable dietary changes may not be fully understood."
"sABSTRACT The benefits of  exclusive breastfeeding  are well documented , yet few women adhere to recommendations . We report the  Behaviour Change Techniques ( BCTs )  within interventions trialled internationally after pregnancy to promote exclusive and mixed breastfeeding as well as evidence of effectiveness . PsycINFO , EMBASE and MEDLINE data bases were screened .  Twenty-three ( n = 23 ) studies met inclusion criteria .  Three authors independently extracted data , coded interventions using the BCT v.1 taxonomy , and assessed study quality . There was a moderate significant effect of the interventions promoting exclusive breastfeeding up to four weeks postpartum ( OR 1.77 , [ 95 % CI : 1.47–2.13 ] ) but this effect slightly declined beyond thirteen weeks ( OR 1.63 , [ 95 % CI : 1.07–2.47 ] ) . Twenty-nine BCTs were identified within interventions .  ‘ Credible source ’  and  ‘ instruction on how to perform the behaviour ’  were the most prevalent and  ‘ social support  ( unspecified ) ’ contributed to the effectiveness of exclusive breastfeeding interventions five to eight weeks postpartum .  Using BCTs  with cognitive and behavioural aspects may help women develop coping mechanisms promoting exclusive breastfeeding . Further trials are needed in  countries with low breastfeeding rates such as the UK .  The use of programme theory during intervention development and clear description of intervention components is recommended . This meta- analysis provides guidance for trials evaluating postpartum breastfeeding interventions."

" :  Patients with PCOS  are at high risk for developing  impaired glucose tolerance  and show a distinct  cardiovascular risk  profile . Therefore , the early identification of affected patients and the institution of  lifestyle changes or pharmacological treatments  may help delay the progression to type  2 diabetes  mellitus and cardiovascular disease."
"eAnti-tumour  necrosis factor ( TNF ) therapies  have revolutionized the management of rheumatoid  arthritis ( RA )  . A high proportion of  RA patients  are now established users of  anti-TNF agents .  Unfortunately , many  RA patients with longst and ing disease  still require elective orthopaedic procedures . Published studies on the influence of  TNF antagonist  on  infection rates  in  RA patients undergoing surgery  are conflicting . However , national registries of  RA patients  on  anti-TNF  reported an increased  risk of infection .  The risk of   anti-TNF-related  infection  is highest at the start of treatment with frequent involvement of the  skin and subcutaneous tissue . Infection  at these sites  could negatively influence the healing of surgical wound .  Current guidelines suggest that treatment with biologics should be discontinued prior to surgery . Patients with established disease are more likely to  flare  compared to those with early disease on stopping treatment . Consequently ,  TNF blockers  need to be reinstated promptly after surgery to avoid the risk of RA flare."
" No evidence was found that consistently demonstrated the  effectiveness  of any  particular  biofeedback treatment   in the control of essential hypertension when compared with  pharmacotherapy , placebo ( sham biofeedback treatment ) , no intervention or other behavioural treatments .  Given the current st and ards for the treatment of hypertension , further research is likely to be considered only as an adjunct to pharmacological interventions."
"sIntroduction  Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV )  is the most common cause of vertigo , and it is characterized by episodes of vertigo roundabout when the head is moved . A systematic review was performed using the most important scientific data bases . This review included studies  published in English in the last ten years  ,  performed in adults  , with emphasis on the diagnosis and  treatment  of  BPPV .  Objective To investigate the  long-term effectiveness  of   vestibular rehabilitation ( VR )   in  patients with BPPV  and the  rate of recurrence of symptoms .  Data Synthesis  A total of 38 studies were identified , of which only 12 met the inclusion criteria .  The majority of the studies stated that   VR   is  effective in decreasing the symptoms  , with a  short-term efficacy  of 84.7 % , and 89.2 % in the long term in the review ed studies . Conclusion Valuable studies show the beneficial effects of the maneuvers for the treatment of BPPV and their long-term effectiveness  .  This strengthens the conclusion that this treatment is effective in resolving symptoms and decreasing recurrences."
"nBackground and Objectives  Social robots  may promote the health of  older adults  by increasing their perceived emotional support and social interaction . This review aims to summarize the effectiveness of  social robots  on  outcomes ( psychological , physiological , quality of life , or medications )  of  older adults from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) .  Research Design and Methods A mixed- method systematic review of RCTs meeting the study inclusion criteria was undertaken .  Eight data bases  were electronically search ed up to September  2017 .  Participants ' characteristics , intervention features , and outcome data were retrieved . The mean difference and st and ardized mean difference with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were synthesized to pool the effect size . Results A total of  13 articles from 11 RCTs were identified from 2,204 articles , of which 9 studies were included in the meta- analysis .  Risk of bias was relatively high in allocation concealment and blinding .  Social robots  appeared to have positive impacts on  agitation , anxiety , and quality of life  for older adults but no statistical significance was found in the meta- analysis . However , results from a narrative review indicated that  social robot interactions  could  improve engagement , interaction , and stress indicators , as well as reduce loneliness and the use of medications  for older adults . Discussion and Implication s  Social robots  appear to have the potential to improve  the well-being of  older adults   , but conclusions are limited due to the lack of high- quality studies . More RCTs are recommended with larger sample sizes and rigorous study design."
" The effectiveness of  occupational therapy  for cognitive impairment post-stroke remains unclear . The potential benefits of  cognitive retraining  delivered as part of  occupational therapy  on improving  basic daily activity function  or specific  cognitive abilities  , or both , of  people who have had a stroke  can not be supported or refuted by the evidence included in this review . More research is required."

"sThe management of  cough  in  adults with respiratory and non-respiratory illnesses  is suboptimal and based mostly on clinical opinions rather than evidence . A systematic review was carried out assessing all trials in  adult patients with respiratory and non-respiratory diseases ( excluding cancer ) that had chronic cough as primary or secondary outcome . A total of 1177 trials were retrieved and 75 met the criteria for inclusion in the review .  The vast majority  were in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .   Cough  was the primary outcome in less than one-quarter of the studies . The measurement of  cough  was variable , mostly using unvali date d scales or being part of an overall ' symptoms ' score . Positive  results  were overall seen with the use of   corticosteroids , leukotriene receptor antagonists , mast cell stabilizers  ,  ipratropium bromide , neltenexine , iodinised glycerol  and  lidocaine .  Speech pathology training  and  symptom monitoring through SMS messages  ( accompanied by treatment adjustments ) have also shown promise . Evidence for established anti-tussive agents such as  codeine  was scarce , with positive studies from the 1960s , whilst more recent studies showed no effect in patients with COPD . Many studies had conflicting results . It is imperative that the management of cough and its evidence base be improved , using higher quality research design s and with  cough  being the primary outcome of trials."
"eBACKGROUND  Motivational Interviewing  is a well-known , scientifically tested method of counselling  clients  developed by Miller and Rollnick and viewed as a useful intervention strategy in the treatment of  lifestyle problems and disease .  AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of  motivational interviewing  in different areas of disease and to identify factors shaping outcomes . DESIGN OF STUDY A systematic review and meta- analysis of  r and omised controlled trials using  motivational interviewing  as  the intervention . METHOD After selection criteria a  systematic literature search in 16 data bases produced 72 r and omised controlled trials the first of which was published in 1991 .  A quality assessment was made with a vali date d scale . A meta- analysis was performed as a generic inverse variance meta- analysis . RESULTS Meta- analysis showed a significant effect ( 95 % confidence interval ) for motivational interviewing for combined effect estimates for  body mass index , total blood cholesterol , systolic blood pressure , blood alcohol concentration and st and ard ethanol content  , while combined effect estimates for  cigarettes per day  and for  HbA(1c )  were not significant .  Motivational  interviewing had a significant and clinical ly relevant effect in approximately three out of four studies , with an equal effect on physiological ( 72 % ) and psychological ( 75 % ) diseases . Psychologists and physicians obtained an effect in approximately 80 % of the studies , while other healthcare providers obtained an effect in 46 % of the studies . When using  motivational interviewing  in brief encounters of 15 minutes , 64 % of the studies showed an  effect  . More than one encounter with the patient ensures the  effectiveness  of motivational interviewing  .    Motivational interviewing  in a scientific setting outperforms traditional advice giving in the treatment of a broad range of behavioural problems and diseases . Large-scale studies are now needed to prove that  motivational interviewing  can be implemented into daily clinical work in primary and secondary health care."
"nThis systematic review and meta- analysis aims to characterize the nutritional status of   geriatric rehabilitation  patients  and its association with functional parameters . Malnutrition is prevalent in a relevant percentage of  geriatric rehabilitation patients  , whereas body mass index ( BMI ) is in the normal to overweight range . Furthermore , data suggest that protein and energy intake is reduced and vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in this population . Decreased physical function is associated with malnutrition according to Mini-Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) and MNA short form , whereas BMI did not show any clear association . Nutritional status is reduced in a relevant percentage of  geriatric rehabilitation patients  and associated with decreased physical function which emphasizes the need for screening and targeted interventions . Since there is only limited evidence available for geriatric rehabilitation patients , this systematic review and meta- analysis aims to characterize the nutritional status in this population and its relationship with functionality . Eight data bases were search ed for full-text articles reporting baseline  nutritional intake and status of adults ≥ 60 years in rehabilitation setting  s. Pooled estimates were calculated for  prevalence of malnutrition  and  risk of malnutrition  based on the Mini Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) and for mean body mass index ( BMI ) . Associations between  nutritional status ( MNA , MNA short form and BMI )  and  functional status ( Barthel Index and Functional Independence Measure )  and prevalence of  sarcopenia  were review ed .  62 out of 1717 references were eligible for inclusion  .  Pooled prevalence  [  95 % confidence interval ( CI )  ]  of malnutrition and risk of malnutrition  were 13 ( 5–20 ) % and 47 ( 40–54 ) % . Pooled estimate ( 95 % CI )  for BMI  was 23.8 ( 23.2–24.5 ) kg/m2 . Existing data suggest a risk for  low protein and energy intake and vitamin D deficiency  .  Functional  status differed widely . Seven out of ten studies reported significant associations  between reduced nutritional status and reduced functionality  , whilst two out of seven studies reported significant associations  between higher BMI and functionality . Prevalence of sarcopenia  was high with 40–76 % in this population . Although geriatric rehabilitation population s and setting s were heterogeneous , a relevant percentage of  geriatric rehabilitation  patients were affected by a  reduced nutritional status .  Nutritional status was associated with  decreased  functionality . This emphasizes the need for screening for malnutrition and targeted nutritional intervention."

" In  patients with asthma or mild COPD  , there is no evidence of an effect of inhaled corticosteroid at conventional doses given for two or three years on  BMD or vertebral fracture .  Higher doses were associated with biochemical markers of  increased bone turnover  , but data on  BMD and fractures  at these doses are not available . There is a need for further , even longer term prospect i ve studies of conventional and high doses of inhaled corticosteroids."
"eRecently , many studies have evaluated  HPV  vaccine  safety and adverse effects .  Two vaccines have been recently evaluated in r and omized controlled trials : the  bivalent vaccine for HPV 16 and 18  ( Cervarix , GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium ) and  the quadrivalent vaccine for HPV 6 , 11 , 16 , and 18  (  Gardasil  , Merck and Co. , Inc. , Whitehouse Station , NJ ) . We have performed a systematic review of all r and omized controlled trials in which  HPV vaccines  were compared with  placebo  regarding  safety  ,  tolerability  and adverse effects . Studies were search ed up to March 2013 in the data bases : Pubmed , Embase , Scielo and Cancerlit . Odds Ratios ( OR ) of most  incident adverse effects  were obtained .  Twelve reports , involving 29,540 subjects , were included .  In the HPV 16/18 group , the most frequently reported events related to the vaccine were  pain  ( OR 3.29 ; 95 % CI : 3.00 - 3.60 ) ,  swelling  ( OR 3.14 ; 95 % CI : 2.79 - 3.53 ) and  redness  ( OR 2.41 ; 95 % CI : 2.17 - 2.68 ) . For the HPV 6/11/16/18 group the events were  pain  ( OR 2.88 ; 95 % CI : 2.42 - 3.43 ) and  swelling  ( OR 2.65 ; 95 % CI : 2.0 - 3.44 ) . Concerning the HPV 16/18 vaccine ,  pain  was the most common outcome detected . These effects can be due to a possible VLP-related inflammation process .  Fatigue  was the most relevant general effect observed followed by  fever , gastrointestinal symptoms , and headache .  In the HPV 6/11/16/18 group , only general  symptoms , pain and swelling  were observed .  Pain and swelling  were the most frequent . Comparing HPV 16/18 to HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccines , the former presented more adverse  effects  , perhaps because there are many more trials evaluating the bivalent vaccine . Other studies are needed to clarify this issue."
"eObjective : The aim of this study was to evaluate if  somatosensory retraining programmes  assist  people  to improve  somatosensory discrimination skills and arm functioning  after  stroke .  Data sources : Nine data bases were systematic ally search ed : Medline , Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature , PsychInfo , Embase , Amed , Web of Science , Physiotherapy Evidence Data base , OT seeker , and Cochrane Library . Review methods : Studies were included for review if they involved ( 1 )  adult participants who had somatosensory impairment in the arm after stroke  , ( 2 ) a programme targeted at  retraining somatosensation  , ( 3 ) a primary measure of somatosensory discrimination skills in the arm , and ( 4 ) an  intervention  study design ( e.g. r and omized or non-r and omized control design s ) . Results :  A total of 6779 articles were screened .  Five group trials and five single case experimental design s were included  ( N = 199 stroke survivors )  . Six studies focused exclusively on retraining somatosensation and four studies focused on somatosensation and motor retraining . St and ardized  somatosensory measures  were typically used for tactile , proprioception , and haptic object recognition modalities . Sensory intervention effect sizes ranged from 0.3 to 2.2 , with an average effect size of 0.85 across somatosensory modalities . A majority of  effect sizes for proprioception and tactile somatosensory domains  were greater than 0.5 , and all but one of the intervention effect sizes were larger than the control effect sizes , at least as point estimates . Six studies measured  motor and /or functional arm outcomes  ( n = 89 participants ) , with narrative analysis suggesting a trend towards improvement in arm use after somatosensory retraining . Conclusion :  Somatosensory retraining  may assist  people  to regain  somatosensory discrimination skills  in the arm after stroke."
 Only a small cohort of medium- to high- quality interventions effectively reduce  surgical harm  and are feasible to implement . It is important that future research remains focused on demonstrating a measurable reduction in  adverse events  from patient safety initiatives.
"sThe aim of this review was to summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of  low-frequency ( LF ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS )  over the unaffected hemisphere in promoting  functional recovery   after stroke .  We performed a systematic search of the studies using  LF-rTMS   over the contralesional hemisphere in stroke patients and review ed the 67 identified articles .  The studies have been gathered together according to the time interval that had elapsed between the stroke onset and the beginning of the  rTMS  treatment .  Inhibitory rTMS  of the contralesional hemisphere can induce  beneficial effects  on  stroke patients with motor impairment , spasticity , aphasia , hemispatial neglect and dysphagia  , but the therapeutic clinical significance is unclear . We observed considerable heterogeneity across studies in the stimulation protocol s. The use of different patient population s , regardless of lesion site and stroke aetiology , different stimulation parameters and outcome measures means that the studies are not readily comparable , and estimating real effectiveness or reproducibility is very difficult . It seems that careful experimental design is needed and it should consider patient selection aspects , rTMS parameters and clinical assessment tools . Consecutive sessions of  rTMS  , as well as the combination with  conventional rehabilitation therapy  , may increase the  magnitude and duration of the beneficial effects .  In an increasing number of studies , the  patients  have been  enrolled early after stroke .  The prolonged follow-up in these patients suggests that the effects of contralesional LF-rTMS can be  long-lasting .  However , physiological evidence indicating increased  synaptic plasticity  , and thus , a more favourable outcome , in the early enrolled patients , is still lacking . Carefully design ed clinical trials design ed are required to address this question .  LF rTMS  over unaffected hemisphere may have therapeutic utility , but the evidence is still preliminary and the findings need to be confirmed in further r and omized controlled trials."
"eAIM To review the  effectiveness and safety  of switching from an  originator anti-TNF ( Remicade ® ) to a biosimilar ( CT-P13 )  in  patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .  METHODS Electronic and manual search up to September 2017 . RESULTS We identified 24 studies evaluating switching between  Remicade ® and CT-P13  in  1326 patients .   Disease control  ( no worsening after switching ) was confirmed in most of the patients ( weighted mean , 88 % ; 95 % CI=86 - 89 % )  . No unexpected adverse effects  were reported in any of the studies .  The risks of switching from  Remicade  ® to a biosimilar seem to be purely theoretical and are not supported by the ( still limited ) real-world clinical practice experience . On the contrary , a steadily increasing number of publications have shown that there seem to be  no safety or efficacy concerns  about switching . Therefore , switching from originator to biosimilar infliximab in  patients with IBD  may be considered acceptable."
"gBackground  Fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FENO )  is a useful and noninvasive biomarker for eosinophilic airway inflammation , particularly in asthma . However , its utility in chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (  COPD ) remains controversial . In this study , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate FENO levels in COPD . Methods A search of PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Library , and clinical trial registry was conducted from inception to January 2018 .  Studies were included if they reported FENO levels in patients with COPD and healthy controls .  We then extracted relevant information and analyzed data . St and ard mean difference ( SMD ) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) was applied in this meta- analysis . Results  A total of 2,073 studies were review ed for eligibility  , with 24 studies pooled for analysis . The  FENO  levels  in patients with COPD  were elevated mildly compared with healthy controls ( SMD 1.28 , 95 % CI 0.60 - 1.96 ) . A similar result was also observed in stable COPD , with an SMD of 1.21 ( 95 % CI 0.47 - 1.96 ) . On the other h and , we found no association  between FENO levels and exacerbated COPD  . Additionally ,  for patients with COPD  ,  ex-smokers  had  higher levels of FENO  than current smokers ( SMD 2.05 , 95 % CI 1.13 - 2.97 ) . Conclusion Our studies demonstrated a mild elevation  of FENO  in COPD , and the association between exacerbated COPD and FENO levels needs to be further explored . The potential mechanism is still unknown and conflicting."

"aThe goal of this systematic review was to investigate and compare the treatment  effects  of  systemic chemotherapy (  i.e.  doxorubicin , gemcitabine , gemcitabine plus docetaxel , or trabectedin )  in  women with inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent , or metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma .  A 2005 systematic review ( search ing the literature from 1980 to June 2004 ) on systemic therapy in advanced uterine sarcoma was used as the basis for this up date d review . MEDLINE and EMBASE ( from January 2004 to June 2011 ) , the Cochrane Library , some main guideline websites and the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Connective Tissue Oncology Society annual meeting abstract s were search ed . One arm from a r and omised controlled trial ( RCT ) , four single-arm phase II trials and one abstract were included in this systematic review . The studies of  gemcitabine plus docetaxel  have reported numerically longer  median overall survival  ( 14.7 - 17.9 months versus 12.1 months ) and numerically higher  objective response rates  ( 27 - 53 % versus 25 % ) than those reported in the study of  doxorubicin alone  . The combination of  gemcitabine plus docetaxel  result ed in more  toxicity  than  doxorubicin  alone . The available study for single-agent  gemcitabine  reported a  tumour response rate  of 21 % , which is not superior to the 25 % response rate with  doxorubicin  alone . One abstract ( pooling data from two RCTs ) failed to show the superiority of  gemcitabine plus docetaxel  over  gemcitabine  alone for  tumour response rate  ( 23 % versus 18 % ) and  progression-free survival  ( 6 versus 4.9 months ) . To date , there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of trabectedin in the target patients .  Doxorubicin , gemcitabine , and gemcitabine plus docetaxel  are treatment options in  women with inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent , or metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma  as first- or second-line therapy . Well- design ed and good- quality RCTs are required to investigate the  efficacy of chemotherapy  and  quality of life  in target patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma."
"yBACKGROUND The role of the  patient navigator  in cancer care and specifically in breast cancer care has grown to incorporate many titles and functions . OBJECTIVE To better evaluate the outcomes of  patient  navigation   in breast cancer care , a comprehensive review of empiric literature detailing the efficacy of  breast cancer navigation  on breast  cancer  outcomes ( screening , diagnosis , treatment , and participation in clinical research ) was performed . METHODS Published articles were review ed  if published in the scientific literature between January 1990 and April 2009 .  Search es were conducted using PubMed and Ovid data bases . Search terms included MeSH ( Medical Subject Headings ) terms ,  "" patient navigator  , "" "" navigation , "" "" breast cancer , "" and "" adherence . "" RESULTS Data -based literature indicates that the role of  patient navigation  is diverse with multiple roles and targeted population s. Navigation across many aspects of the breast cancer disease trajectory improves  adherence  to breast cancer care . The empiric review found that  navigation interventions  have been more commonly applied in breast cancer screening and early diagnosis than for adherence to treatment .  There is evidence supporting the role of  patient navigation  in breast cancer to improve many aspects of breast cancer care . IMPLICATION S FOR PRACTICE Data describing the role of  patient navigation  in breast cancer will assist in better defining future direction for the  breast navigation role  . Ongoing research will better inform issues related to role definition , integration into clinical breast cancer care , impact on quality of life , cost-effectiveness , and sustainability."
"sRobot-Assisted  Therapy ( RT )  is an innovative approach to neurological rehabilitation that uses intensive , repetitive , interactive , and individualized practice . This systematic review aim ed to investigate the effectiveness of  RT  on the body function and structure of  people with upper limb impairments  ( PROSPERO registration : CRD42017054982 ) . A search strategy conducted on seven data bases identified r and  omized  controlled studies . Method ological quality was assessed using the PEDro scale . When possible , the data were pooled , the strength of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system , and the effect sizes were assessed using Cohen coefficient . Subgroup analyses investigated the impact on the estimated effects of the following parameters : method ological quality ; portion of the assessed upper limb ; duration of stroke ; and intervention dose and duration .  Thirty-eight studies involving 1174 participants were included .  Pooled estimates revealed small  effects  of   RT   on  motor control  and medium  effects on strength  compared with other intervention ( OI ) at a short-term follow-up . St and ardized differences in means were as follows : 0.3 ( 95 % CI 0.1 to 0.4 ) and 0.5 ( 95 % CI 0.2 to 0.8 ) . Effects at other time points and on other investigated  outcomes related to body function and structure  were not found ( p>0.05 ) . The strength of the current evidence was usually low quality . Subgroup analyses suggested that the method ological quality , and  duration  and dose  of RT  may influence the estimated effects . In conclusion  , RT  has  small effects on motor control  and  medium effects on strength  in  people with limited upper limb function .  Poor method ological quality , and lower treatment dose and duration may impact negatively the estimated effects."
"sMetformin has been gradually used in the management of  gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) .  In order to prove the safety and efficacy of  metformin  used in pregnancy , we search ed several data bases for the reports of r and omized trials comparing  insulin and metformin  used in GDM and conducted a meta- analysis . Data showed the  rates of neonatal large for gestational age , cesarean section , neonatal respiratory distress and preterm birth  were similar in both  groups .   Maternal glycated hemoglobin-%  at gestational week 36 - 37 was significantly lower in  metformin  group , indicating good glycemic control of  metformin .   Maternal weight gain  since enrollment to gestational week 36 - 37 was also lower in  metformin  group , making  metformin  worth using even when  metformin  is insufficient and supplementary  insulin  is needed . Data also showed that  metformin  significantly reduced the  gestational hypertension complications  in  GDM patients  , probably by reducing the  endothelial activation and maternal inflammatory response of insulin resistance .  Although  metformin  can cross the placenta , it is less likely to cause  severe neonatal hypoglycemia  compared with  insulin  since it neither stimulates pancreatic insulin release nor increases circulating  insulin levels  . According to most  maternal and neonatal outcomes  ,  metformin  is an  effective and safe alternative  to insulin for GDM patients."
" On the basis of our findings , the evidence is not fully convincing for most complementary and alternative medicine modalities in relieving  neuropathic or neuralgic  pain  .  However , for  topically applied capsaicin  there is evidence of effectiveness beyond  placebo .  The evidence can be classified as encouraging and warrants further study for  cannabis extract , magnets , carnitine  , and electrostimulation."
"tThe purpose of this study was to assess the  safety and efficacy  of  progressive resistance training ( PRT )  in  breast cancer .  R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) published to November 2013 that reported on the effects of  PRT  ( > 6 weeks ) on   breast cancer-related lymphedema ( BCRL )  ( incidence/exacerbation , arm volume , and symptom severity )  ,  physical functioning ( upper  and  lower body muscular strength )  , and  health-related quality of life ( HRQoL )   in breast cancer patients were included .  Of  446 citations retrieved , 15 RCTs in 1,652 patients were included  and yielded five studies on BCRL incidence/exacerbation ( N = 647 ) , four studies on arm volume ( N = 384 ) and BCRL symptom severity ( N = 479 ) , 11 studies on upper body muscular strength ( N = 1,252 ) , nine studies on lower body muscular strength ( N = 1,079 ) , and seven studies on HRQoL ( N = 823 ) . PRT  reduced the risk of BCRL  versus control conditions [ OR = 0.53 ( 95 % CI 0.31–0.90 ) ; I2 = 0 % ] and  did not worsen arm volume or symptom severity  ( both SMD = −0.07 ) . PRT  significantly improved upper  [ SMD = 0.57 ( 95 % CI 0.37–0.76 ) ; I2 = 58.4  % ] and lower body muscular strength  [ SMD = 0.48 ( 95 % CI 0.30–0.67 ) ; I2 = 46.7  % ] but not HRQoL  [ SMD = 0.17 ( 95 % CI −0.03 to 0.38 ) ; I2 =  47.0  %  ]  .  The effect  of  PRT on HRQoL  became significant in our sensitivity analysis when two studies conducted during adjuvant chemotherapy [ SMD = 0.30 ( 95 % CI 0.04–0.55 ) , I2 = 37.0 % ] were excluded . These data  indicate  that  PRT improves physical functioning and reduces the risk of BCRL  . Clinical practice guidelines should be up date d to inform clinicians on the benefits of PRT in this cohort."
"eBACKGROUND Worldwide , placenta-related complications contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes , such as  pre-eclampsia , fetal growth restriction and preterm birth  , with implication s for the future health of  mothers and offspring .  The placenta develops in the periconception period and forms the interface between mother and embryo/fetus . An unhealthy periconceptional maternal lifestyle , such as smoking , alcohol and under- and over-nutrition , can detrimentally influence placental development and function . OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE The impact of maternal lifestyle on placental health is largely unknown . Therefore , we aim to summarize the evidence of the impact of  periconceptional maternal lifestyle  on clinical features and biomarkers of placental development and function throughout pregnancy . SEARCH METHODS A comprehensive search in Medline , Embase , Pubmed , The Cochrane Library Web of Science and Google Scholar was conducted . The search strategy included keywords related to the  maternal lifestyle , smoking , alcohol , caffeine , nutrition ( including folic acid supplement intake )  and body weight . For placental markers throughout pregnancy , keywords related to ultrasound imaging , serum biomarkers and histological characteristics were used . We included r and omized controlled trials and observational studies published between January 2000 and March 2017 and restricted the analysis to  singleton pregnancies and  maternal periconceptional lifestyle .   Method ological quality was scored using the ErasmusAGE tool . A protocol of this systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO International prospect i ve register of systematic review s ( PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016045596 ) . OUTCOMES Of  2593 unique citations found , 82 studies were included .  The median quality score was 5 ( range : 0 - 10 ) . The findings revealed that maternal smoking was associated with  lower first-trimester placental vascularization flow indices , higher second- and third-trimester resistance of the uterine and umbilical arteries  and  lower resistance of the middle cerebral artery .  Although a negative impact of smoking on  placental weight  was expected , this was less clear . Alcohol use was associated with a  lower placental weight .  One study described higher  second- and third-trimester placental growth factor ( PlGF ) levels  after periconceptional alcohol use . None of the studies looked at caffeine intake . Adequate nutrition in the first trimester ,  periconceptional folic acid supplement intake  and strong adherence to a Mediterranean diet , were all associated with a  lower resistance of the uterine and umbilical arteries  in the second and third trimester . A low caloric intake result ed in a  lower placental weight , length , breadth , thickness , area and volume .  Higher  maternal body weight  was associated with a larger placenta measured by ultrasound in the second and third trimester of pregnancy or weighed at birth . In addition , higher maternal body weight was associated with decreased  PlGF-levels  . WIDER IMPLICATION S Evidence of the impact of periconceptional maternal lifestyle on placental health was demonstrated . However , due to poorly defined lifestyle exposures and time windows of investigation , unst and ardized measurements of placenta-related outcomes and small sample sizes of the included studies , a cautious interpretation of the effect estimates is indicated . We suggest that future research should focus more on physiological consequences  of unhealthy lifestyle  during the critical periconception window . Moreover , we foresee that new evidence will support the development of  lifestyle interventions  to improve  the health of  mothers  and their  offspring   from the earliest moment in life."

In addition , no  survival  benefits are obtained from  erlotinib-based doublet therapy  , thus single  agent erlotinib  could be recommended as third-line treatment for unselected  advanced NSCLC  patients."

"IColorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the most common cancer diseases worldwide . One in 4  patients with CRC  will have a disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis and often in the form of synchronous liver metastases . Studies suggest that up to 30 % of patients have non-recognized hepatic metastases during primary surgery for CRC .  Intraoperative ultrasonography examination ( IOUS )  of the liver to detect liver metastases was considered the gold st and ard during open CRC surgery . Today  laparoscopic surgery  is the st and ard procedure , but  laparoscopic ultrasound examination ( LUS  ) is not performed routinely . Aim To perform a systematic review of the test performance of IOUS and LUS regarding the detection of synchronous liver metastases in  patients undergoing surgery for primary CRC .  Method The literature was systematic ally review ed using the search engines : PubMed , Cochrane , Embase and Google .  21 studies were  included in the review and the key words :  intraoperative ultrasound  ,  laparoscopic ultrasound  , staging colon and rectum cancer . Results  Intraoperative ultrasound  showed a  higher sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value and overall accuracy  for the detection liver metastases during surgery for primary CRC , compared to  preoperative imaging modalities ( ultrasound , computed tomography ( CT ) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography ( CE-CT ) ) .  LUS showed a  higher detection rate for liver metastases  compared to  CT , CE-CT  and  magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )  . Conclusion This systematic review found that both IOUS and LUS had a  higher detection rate  regarding liver metastases during primary CRC surgery , especially liver metastases<10 mm in diameter , when compared to US , CT ,  CE-CT  and MRI."
"dSchool-based  interventions  aim ed at modifying the knowledge , attitudes , social norms , and intended future practice regarding breastfeeding may be an effective way of improving  breastfeeding  rates . A systematic review of relevant literature was conducted to identify scientifically rigorous studies on  school-based interventions and promotion activities  that focus on breastfeeding  .  Of the 1990 citations review ed , only 6 empirical articles on   school-based interventions  to promote  breastfeeding   were found and these interventions vary greatly in terms of format , duration , outcome measures , and significance of the results . Overall , these studies demonstrated positive effects on  perceptions and attitudes toward breastfeeding  and increased  behavioral intention of breastfeeding later in life .   School-based breastfeeding promotion programs  hold promise for increasing knowledge of  breastfeeding  and  support for breastfeeding  , promoting positive attitudes , creating a culture where breastfeeding is the norm , and increasing future intentions to breastfeed."
">OBJECTIVE  Partners  have a significant role in a  person  's ability to adjust to a  chronic  physical illness , which warrants their inclusion in couples interventions . However to deliver more specific , tailored support it is necessary to explore which types of couples interventions are most effective across certain chronic illness population s and outcomes . METHODS  Five data bases  were search ed using selected terms .  Thirty-five articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion .  RESULTS The majority of studies were from  the US  , and most interventions  targeted cancer population s.  Couples interventions fell into two categories according to therapeutic approach ;  Cognitive Behavioural Skills Training ( CBST ) and Relationship Counselling ( RC ) .  When compared with a  patient-only intervention  or  controls , CBST interventions  effectively targeted  behavioural , physical/somatic and cognitive outcomes  , while RC more effectively targeted  interpersonal outcomes .   Couples interventions can be more  effective  than patient-only interventions or controls across various patient and partner outcomes . Couples interventions tend to favour a skills-based or a relationship-based approach , which strongly influences the types outcomes effectively targeted . PRACTICE IMPLICATION S Our findings suggest it could be therapeutically useful to integrate these two approaches to more holistically support  couples living with chronic illness .  We also identify the need to target  understudied illness groups and ethnicities ."
"eBACKGROUND Despite limited evidence , it is often asserted that natural frequencies ( for example , 2 in 1000 ) are the best way to communicate absolute risks . OBJECTIVE To compare comprehension of treatment benefit and harm when absolute risks are presented as natural frequencies , percents , or both . DESIGN Parallel-group r and omized trial with central allocation and masking of investigators to group assignment , conducted through an Internet survey in September 2009 . ( Clinical Trials.gov registration number : NCT00950014 ) SETTING  National sample of U.S. adults r and omly selected from a professional survey firm 's research panel of about 30,000 households .  PARTICIPANTS  2944 adults aged 18 years or older ( all with complete follow-up ) .   INTERVENTION Tables presenting absolute risks  in 1 of 5 numeric formats :  natural frequency  ( x in 1000 )  , variable frequency  ( x in 100 , x in 1000 , or x in 10,000 , as needed to keep the numerator > 1 ) ,  percent  ,  percent plus natural frequency  , or  percent plus variable  frequency . MEASUREMENTS  Comprehension  as assessed by  18 questions  ( primary outcome ) and  judgment of treatment benefit and harm .  RESULTS  The average number of comprehension questions answered correctly  was lowest in the variable frequency group and highest in the percent group ( 13.1 vs. 13.8 ; difference , 0.7 [ 95 % CI , 0.3 to 1.1 ] ) .  The proportion of participants who "" passed "" the comprehension test  ( ≥13  correct answers  ) was lowest in the natural and variable frequency groups and highest in the percent group ( 68 % vs. 73 % ; difference , 5 percentage points [ CI , 0 to 10 percentage points ] ) . The largest format effect was seen for the 2 questions about absolute differences :  the proportion correct  in the natural frequency versus percent groups was 43 % versus 72 % ( P < 0.001 ) and 73 % versus 87 % ( P < 0.001 ) . LIMITATION Even when data were presented in the percent format , one third of participants failed the comprehension test .  Natural frequencies are not the best format for communicating the absolute benefits and harms of treatment . The more succinct percent format result ed in  better comprehension : Comprehension  was slightly better overall and notably better for absolute differences .

"sAIM This paper is a report of a systematic review of r and omized controlled trials of interventions to  change maladaptive  illness beliefs in  people with coronary heart disease  , and was conducted to determine whether such interventions were effective in changing maladaptive beliefs , and to assess any consequent change in coping and outcome . BACKGROUND An increasing body of evidence suggests that faulty beliefs can lead to maladaptive behaviours and , in turn , to poor outcomes . However , the effectiveness of interventions to change such faulty illness beliefs in  people with coronary heart disease  is unknown . DATA SOURCES Multiple data bases were search ed using a systematic search strategy . In addition , reference lists of included papers were checked and key authors in the field contacted . REVIEW METHODS The systematic review included r and omized controlled trials with  adults of any age with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease and an intervention aim  ed at changing cardiac beliefs . The primary outcome measured was  change in beliefs about coronary heart disease .  RESULTS  Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria  . Owing to the heterogeneity of these studies , quantitative synthesis was not practicable . Descriptive synthesis of the results suggested that  cognitive behavioural and counselling/education interventions  can be effective in changing beliefs . The effects of changing beliefs on  behavioural , functional and psychological outcomes  remain unclear .  While some interventions may be effective in changing beliefs in people with coronary heart disease , the effect of these changes on outcome is not clear . Further high quality research is required before firmer guidance can be given to clinicians on the most effective method to dispel cardiac misconceptions."

"DIn Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) , slow gait speed is significantly related to clinical ratings of disease severity , impaired performance of daily activities , as well as increased overall disability . Conducting a meta- analysis on gait speed is an objective and quantitative technique to summarize the effectiveness of DBS and to determine the effect sizes for future studies . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis that analyzed the effects of  deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery  on  gait speed  in  patients with PD  to gain fundamental insight into the nature of therapeutic effectiveness . A r and om effects model meta- analysis on  27 studies  revealed a significant overall st and ardized mean difference medium effect size equal to 0.60 ( SE = 0.06 ; p < 0.0001 ; Z = 10.58 ) . Based on our synthesis of the 27 studies , we determined the following : ( 1 ) a significant and medium effect size indicating DBS improves  gait speed ;  ( 2 )  DBS  improved  gait speed  regardless of whether the patients were tested in the on or off medication state ; ( 3 ) both bilateral and  unilateral DBS  led to  gait speed improvement  ; ( 4 ) the effects of  DBS  on  gait speed  in the data collection sessions after surgery ( DBS on vs. off ) were comparable with data collection before surgery ( before surgery vs. DBS after surgery ) ; and ( 5 ) when evaluating the effects of  DBS  and medication on  gait speed  suprathreshold doses were comparable to normal dosages of medication and  DBS  . The current analysis provides objective evidence that both  unilateral  and  bilateral DBS  provide a therapeutic benefit on  gait speed  in persons with PD."

"dIt is debated whether  patients with celiac disease ( CD )  have  non-protective antibody responses to  HBV vaccination   more frequently than non-affected subjects . To perform a literature review and meta- analysis on  protective response  to  HBV vaccination   in CD patients .  RCTs and observational controlled studies were eligible . Outcome of interest was an  anti-HBs ( HBsAb ) titer ≥ 10 IU/L after last vaccine dose .  Comparative index was rate  ratio ( RR )  . Heterogeneity between studies was addressed and funnel plots were analyzed . Meta-regression models were applied to investigate effect size due to study -specific variables .  Twelve retrospective studies on a total of 1,447 participants and 4 prospect i ve studies on 184 subjects were selected .   The  RR was 0.732 ( 95 % C.I. : 0.664 - 0.808 ) and 0.777 ( 95 % C.I. : 0.629 - 0.960 ) in the prospect i ve and retrospective studies , respectively . The I(2 ) , indicating heterogeneity , was 51.1 % in retrospective , 39.8 % in prospect i ve  studies . Non-protective antibody responses  occurred more frequently in patients than controls . Due to limitations in the available studies , additional trials to evaluate  post-vaccination HBsAb titer  in  CD patients  are needed."

"tBACKGROUND  Obstructive  sleep apnea  ( OSA )  is a common disorder that affects both  quality of life  and  cardiovascular health .  The causal link between OSA and  cardiovascular morbidity⁄mortality  remains elusive . One possible explanation is that repeated episodes of nocturnal hypoxia lead to a hypercoagulable state that predisposes patients to thrombotic events . There is evidence supporting a wide array of hematological changes that affect hemostasis ( eg , increased  hematocrit  ,  blood viscosity  , platelet  activation  , clotting factors and decreased  fibrinolytic activity  ) . OBJECTIVE To provide a comprehensive review of the current evidence associating OSA with increased  coagulability  , and to highlight areas for future research . METHODS Keyword search es in Ovid Medline were used to identify relevant articles ; all references in the articles were search ed for relevant titles . The Web of Science was used to identify articles citing the relevant articles found using the Ovid Medline search . All original peer- review ed articles , meta-analyses and systematic review s regarding the pertinent topics between 1990 and present were selected for review . RESULTS  Hematocrit , blood viscosity , certain clotting factors , tissue factor , platelet activity and whole blood coagulability  are increased in patients with OSA , while fibrinolysis is impaired .  There is considerable evidence that  OSA  is associated with a procoagulant state . Several factors are involved in the procoagulant state associated with OSA . There is a need for adequately powered clinical studies involving well-matched control groups to address potential confounding variables , and to accurately delineate the individual factors involved in the procoagulant state associated with OSA and their response to treatment."

" There is still remarkably little research on this common and , to patients , very significant issue of bowel management . The available evidence is almost uniformly of low method ological quality . The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret , not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials , against control rather than compared against each other , and the interventions are very different from each other . There was very limited evidence from individual trials in favour of a  bulk-forming laxative ( psyllium )  , an  isosmotic macrogol laxative , abdominal massage , electrical stimulation  and an  anticholinesterase-anticholinergic drug combination ( neostigmine-glycopyrrolate )  compared to  no treatment or controls .  There was also evidence in favour of   transanal irrigation   ( compared to  conservative management )  ,   oral carbonated ( rather  than  tap ) water and abdominal massage with lifestyle advice   ( compared to  lifestyle advice alone ) .  However , these findings need to be confirmed by larger well- design ed controlled trials which should include evaluation of the  acceptability  of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life."

"MGestational diabetes mellitus  (  GDM ) is associated with increased rates of  fetal morbidity and mortality  , both during the pregnancy and in the postnatal life . Current treatment of GDM includes  diet with or without medications  , but this management is expensive and poorly cost-effective for the health care systems . Strategies to prevent such condition would be preferable with respect to its treatment . The aim of this literature review was to evaluate studies reporting the efficacy of the most used approaches to prevent GDM as well as evidence s of efficacy and safety of dietary supplementations . Systematic literature search es were performed in electronic data bases , covering the  period January 1983 to April 2014 .  R and omized controlled clinical trials were included .  Quality  of the articles was evaluated with the  Jadad scale  . We did not evaluate those articles that were already entered in the most recent systematic review s , and we completed the research with the trials published thereafter . Of  55 articles identified , 15 r and omized controlled trials were eligible .  Quality and heterogeneity of the studies can not allow firm conclusions . Anyway , trials in which only intake or expenditure has been targeted mostly reported negative results . On the contrary , combined lifestyle programs including  diet control   ( orienting  food intake , restricting energy intake ) associated with moderate but continuous physical activity exhibit better  efficacy  in reducing  GDM prevalence  . The results from  dietary supplements with myoinositol or probiotics  are promising . The actual evidence s provide enough arguments for implementing large-scale , high- quality r and omized controlled trials looking at the possible benefits of these new approaches for preventing GDM."

"rUNLABELLED Significant progress has been made in the field of  exercise-oncology  research over the past two decades . As the field continues to forge ahead , it is time to reflect on past accomplishments in order to inform and define the critical unanswered questions postulated to have the largest impact on the field and on clinical care . Against this background , we overview the extant literature base together with ongoing/planned studies examining the role of  exercise therapy   following a cancer diagnosis  with a view towards identifying major gaps in the knowledge . METHOD We adapted the  Physical  Exercise  Across the Cancer Experience ( PEACE )  organizational framework to systematic ally overview published as well as ongoing studies of  exercise therapy  across the cancer survivorship continuum [ i.e. 1 ) pretreatment ; 2 ) during treatment ; and 3 ) post-treatment ] . To overview ongoing studies , we performed a systematic review of all   exercise trials  in adult cancer patients registered in Clinical Trials . Gov  and the International St and ard R and omized Controlled Trial Number Register . RESULTS Data from published studies provides relatively strong evidence that  exercise therapy  is a  well-tolerated and safe  adjunct therapy that can mitigate several common treatment-related side effects among  cancer patients  across the PEACE framework . In addition , observational studies suggest that higher levels of exercise may be associated with improved prognosis in  patients with  solid tumors . Regarding ongoing studies , a total of  82 independent clinical studies  were identified . Consistent with prior work , most ongoing studies are being conducted either during or following adjuvant therapy in women with breast cancer with  exercise interventions  following  st and ard exercise prescription guidelines .  Across all studies , there were a total of approximately 51 different primary endpoints ; in two-thirds of studies ,  quality of life , fatigue , or physical functioning  was the primary endpoint .  There have been significant leaps in knowledge regarding the role and efficacy of  exercise therapy  in  cancer survivors  over the past 25 years . On the platform of this evidence base , it is now time to launch the next generation of research to ensure continued progress in this emergent field . This work will continue to contribute to the ultimate goal of improving both the quantity and quality  of  life of persons diagnosed with cancer."

"nAIM The aim of this review was to determine if  ventilation-weaning protocol s  developed and implemented by  multidisciplinary teams  ( MDTs ) reduced the  duration of mechanical ventilation  in  adult intensive care patients  compared to usual care . METHOD A systematic review was conducted to review published research  studies from January 1999 to June 2009  to identify and analyse the best available evidence on  MDT-based weaning protocol  s in  adult intensive care patients .  All relevant studies based on electronic search es of MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry and the Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s were included . Where possible data were pooled and a meta- analysis performed . A narrative synthesis of data was conducted to provide a critical appraisal of nonr and omised controlled trials included in the review . RESULTS Three pre- and postinterventional studies were identified for inclusion in this review . Results show equivocal support for weaning protocol s developed and implemented by MDTs for reducing  duration of mechanical ventilation .   Communication and organizational processes must be addressed for multidisciplinary protocol s to be effective . Due to method ological limitations of included studies , large r and omised controlled trials are required to provide high-level evidence of the effects of  MDT-based protocol  s on duration of mechanical ventilation."

">Adequate supply of  micronutrients  during the first 1000 days is essential for normal development and healthy life . We aim ed to investigate if interventions administering  dietary doses  up to the  recommended nutrient intake  ( RNI )  of iron and zinc  within the window from conception to age 2 years have the potential to influence nutritional status and development of  children .  To address this objective , a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized and quasi-r and omized fortification , biofortification , and supplementation trials in  women ( pregnant and lactating ) and children ( 6 - 23 months ) delivering  iron  or zinc  in doses up to the recommended nutrient intake ( RNI ) levels was conducted . Supplying  iron or zinc  during pregnancy had no effects on birth outcomes . There were limited or no data on the effects of  iron/zinc  during pregnancy and lactation on  child iron/zinc status , growth , morbidity , and psychomotor and mental development .  Delivering up to 15 mg  iron/day  during infancy  increased mean hemoglobin  by 4 g/L ( p < 0.001 ) and  mean serum ferritin concentration  by 17.6 µg/L ( p < 0.001 ) and reduced  the risk for anemia  by 41 % ( p < 0.001 ) ,  iron deficiency  by 78 % ( ID ; p < 0.001 ) and  iron deficiency anemia  by 80 % ( IDA ; p < 0.001 ) , but had  no effect on growth or psychomotor development .  Providing up to 10 mg of  additional zinc  during infancy  increased plasma zinc concentration  by 2.03 µmol/L ( p < 0.001 ) and  reduced the risk of zinc deficiency  by 47 % ( p < 0.001 ) . Further , we observed positive effects  on child weight for age z-score ( WAZ )  ( p < 0.05  ) , weight for height z-score ( WHZ )  ( p < 0.05 ) , but  not on height for age z-score ( HAZ ) or the risk for stunting , wasting , and underweight  . There are no studies covering the full 1000 days window and the effects  of iron and zinc  delivered during pregnancy and lactation on child outcomes are ambiguous , but low dose daily  iron and zinc  use during 6 - 23 months of age has a positive effect  on child iron and zinc status ."

METHODS By using electronic data bases , the goal was to search and evaluate all the r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) in which  acupuncture  was used in the management of  pain  attributed to these clinical entities . For the meta- analysis , an adequate description of the results ' statistical data was required along with a comparison of the treatment with a control group using a  placebo or sham .  Two independent review ers evaluated the quality of the studies using the  Jadad scale .  RESULTS A total of  8 RCTs were selected  , and the quality of only 4 was considered acceptable . These 4 studies showed positive results such as  reducing pain , improving masticatory function , and increasing maximum interincisal opening .  By combining  the studies ( n=96 )  and analyzing the results , it was concluded that  acupuncture  is more effective than  placebo  in reducing  pain intensity in TMD  ( st and ardized mean difference 0.83 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.41 - 1.25 ; P=0.00012 ) . DISCUSSION The results of this meta- analysis suggest that  acupuncture  is a reasonable adjunctive treatment for producing a short-term analgesic  effect  in  patients with painful TMD symptoms .  Although the results described are positive , the relevance of these results was limited by the fact that substantial bias was present . These findings must be confirmed by future RCTs that improve the method ologic deficiencies of the studies evaluated in this meta- analysis."
" In  children with mild-moderate asthma  ,  beclomethasone  200 mcg twice daily caused a decrease in  linear growth  of -1.54 cm per year . These studies lasted a maximum of 54 weeks , so it remains unclear whether the decrease in  growth  is sustained or whether it reverses with ' catch up ' after therapy is discontinued . We are unable to comment on  growth effects  of other inhaled steroids that have potentially less systemic effects . If inhaled steroids are required to control a child 's asthma , we recommend using the minimum dose that effectively controls the child 's asthma and closely following growth."

"sBACKGROUND Hypoxemia is an immediate consequence of  obstructive sleep apnea .   Oxygen ( O2 ) administration  has been used as an alternative treatment in  patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) who do not adhere to  continuous positive airway pressure  (  CPAP )   in order to reduce the deleterious effects of intermittent hypoxemia during sleep . This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of  O2 therapy  on  patients with OSA .  METHOD We conducted a systematic search of the data bases Medline , Embase , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  ( 1(st ) Quarter  2011  )  , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s ( from 1950 to February 2011 ) . Our search strategy yielded  4,793 citations  . Irrelevant papers were excluded by title and abstract review , leaving 105 manuscripts . We review ed all prospect i ve studies that included : ( 1 ) a  target population with obstructive sleep apnea  , ( 2 )  O2 therapy and /or CPAP  as a study intervention , ( 3 ) the effects of  O2  on the  apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , nocturnal hypoxemia  , or  apnea duration .  RESULTS We identified  14 studies including a total of 359 patients .  Nine studies were of single cohort design , while 5 studies were r and omized control trials with 3 groups  ( CPAP , oxygen  ,  and placebo/sham CPAP )  . When  CPAP  was compared to  O2 therapy  , all but one showed a significant improvement in  AHI .  Ten studies demonstrated that  O2  therapy improved  oxygen saturation  vs. placebo . However , the  average duration of apnea and hypopnea episodes  were longer in patients receiving  O2 therapy  than those receiving  placebo .   This review shows that  O2 therapy  significantly improves  oxygen saturation  in  patients with OSA .  However , it may also increase the duration of apnea-hypopnea events."
" : Lifestyle + metformin  is associated  with lower BMI and subcutaneous adipose  tissue and improved menstruation in  women with PCOS  compared with lifestyle  ±  placebo over 6  months . Metformin  alone compared with lifestyle showed  similar  BMI at 6 months . These results suggest the  combination of lifestyle with metformin  has a role to play in weight management  :  a key concern for  women with PCOS .  Existing study limitations include small sample sizes , short duration s and risk of bias . With international guidelines now acknowledging that lifestyle and pharmacotherapy are required for  weight loss and maintenance in obesity  , future studies of appropriate size and duration are vital to clarify the role of  metformin  in PCOS management."
"SPurpose To examine the  feasibility , acceptability , and efficacy  of  online supportive care interventions  targeting  prostate cancer survivors ( PCS ) .  Methods Studies were identified through structured search es of PubMed , Embase and PsycINFO data bases , and bibliographic review . Inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) examined feasibility , acceptability , or efficacy of an  online intervention design ed  to improve supportive care outcomes for PCS ; ( 2 ) presented outcome data collected from PCS separately ( if mixed cancer ) ; and ( 3 ) evaluated efficacy outcomes using r and omized controlled trial ( RCT ) design . Results Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria ; ten were classified as RCTs . Overall ,  2446 men ( average age 64 years ) were included .  Studies reported on the following outcomes :  feasibility and acceptability of an  online intervention  ( e.g.  ,  patient support , online medical record/follow-ups , or decision aids ) ; reducing decisional conflict/distress ; improving cancer-related distress and health-related quality of life ; and satisfaction with cancer care  . Conclusion We found good preliminary evidence for online supportive care among PCS , but little high level evidence . Generally , the sample s were small and unrepresentative . Further , inadequate  acceptability  measures made it difficult to determine actual  PCS acceptability  and  satisfaction  , and lack of control groups precluded strong conclusions regarding efficacy . Translation also appears minimal ; few interventions are still publicly available . Larger trials with appropriate control groups and greater emphasis on translation of effective interventions is recommended . Implication s for Cancer SurvivorsProstate cancer survivors have a variety of unmet supportive care needs . Using online delivery to improve the reach of high- quality supportive care programs could have a positive impact on  health-related quality of life  among PCS."
"nPurpose Research in the field of  vocational rehabilitation  , specifically for prostate cancer , remains rare despite increasing recognition of the role of  vocational interventions  in other cancer groups . The aim of this review was to compile and evaluate current trends , facilitators and barriers associated with returning to work after a  prostate cancer diagnosis  . Method The literature search was conducted in March 2018 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines .  Forty-seven  original research papers published in  English in peer- review ed  journals were identified . The included studies  comprised  a  total of 20,083 prostate cancer patients with a mean age of 61 years .  Results The studies implied a good  overall return to work prognosis  in prostate cancer patients ; however , these findings are not generalisable to those with  physically dem and ing or low paid jobs , comorbid conditions or poor physical functioning .  Conclusion The limited research investigating the long-term implication s of prostate cancer indicates that there may be problems related to  job retention and early unwanted retirement .  Facilitators and barriers to employment after prostate cancer are identified and implication s for vocational interventions and further research are discussed . Implication s for Cancer SurvivorsThis review helps to shed light on the barriers and facilitators to employment among prostate cancer survivors , as well as the need for further research and development in  vocational rehabilitation interventions  for this population."
"eMaternal  lifestyle during pregnancy  , as well as  early nutrition  and the environment infants are raised in , are considered relevant factors for the prevention of   childhood obesity .   Several models are available for the prediction of  childhood overweight and obesity  , yet most have not been externally vali date d. Moreover , the factors considered in the models differ among studies as the outcomes manifest after birth and depend on maturation processes that vary between individuals . The current Review examines and interprets data on the early determinants of  childhood obesity  to provide relevant strategies for daily clinical work . We evaluate a selection of prenatal and postnatal  factors associated with  child adiposity .   Actions to be considered for preventing childhood obesity include the promotion of  healthy  maternal  nutrition  and  weight  status at reproductive age and during pregnancy , as well as careful monitoring of infant growth to detect early excessive  weight  gain . Paediatricians and other health-care professionals should provide scientifically vali date d , individual nutritional advice to families to counteract excessive adiposity in children . Based on systematic review s , original papers and scientific reports , we provide information to help with setting up public health strategies to prevent overweight and obesity in childhood .  Obesity among children and adolescents  is highly prevalent in both  developed and developing countries  . This Review discusses data on the early determinants of  childhood obesity  in order to provide relevant strategies for daily clinical work . Key pointsMaternal obesity has become an important public health problem influencing adiposity of mother  and child  in both  low-income and high-income countries  . Specific measurements of  offspring adiposity  and not only  BMI  are required ;  maternal BMI  at the time of pregnancy ,  gestational weight gain  and  gestational diabetes  are independent risk factors of excess adiposity in the offspring . Pregnant women should follow a healthy lifestyle , avoiding malnutrition and smoking , and  moderate free sugar intake  to reduce  child adiposity  risk . Despite the inconclusive effect of breastfeeding on reducing  obesity risk  later in life , breastfeeding should be promoted owing to its many beneficial effects . Not enough data exist to conclusively link the timing of introduction of  complementary feeding , prebiotic and probiotic consumption  , and screen time with later   overweight and obesity  in children up to 2 years of age .  In children ,  high-protein intake  , consumption  of sugar-sweetened beverages  and short sleep time are associated with  adiposity  during the first 2 years of life."
" There appears to be an  OS and DFS   benefit for cisplatin-based AC  in UTUC . This evidence is limited by the retrospective nature of studies and their relatively small sample size . NC appears to be promising , but more trials are needed to confirm its utility . PATIENT SUMMARY After a comprehensive search of studies examining the role of chemotherapy for upper tract urothelial cancer , the pooled evidence shows  that cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy  was beneficial for  prolonging survival ."
"nBackground  E-health interventions  have become increasingly popular , including in perioperative care . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of  perioperative e-health interventions  on the postoperative course . Methods We conducted a systematic review and search ed for relevant articles in the PUBMED , EMBASE , CINAHL and COCHRANE data bases . Controlled  trials written in English , with participants of 18 years and older who underwent any type of surgery and which evaluated  any type  of  e-health  intervention  by reporting patient-related outcome measures focusing on the period after surgery ,  were included  . Data of all included studies were extracted and study quality was assessed by using the Downs and Black scoring system . Findings A  total of 33 articles were included  , reporting on 27 unique studies . Most studies were judged as having a medium risk of bias ( n = 13 ) , 11 as a low risk of bias , and three as high risk of bias studies .  Most studies included patients undergoing cardiac ( n = 9 ) or orthopedic surgery ( n = 7 ) .  All studies focused on  replacing  ( n = 11 ) or  complementing  ( n = 15 )  perioperative usual care with some form of care via ICT ;  one study evaluated both type of interventions . Interventions consisted of an  educational or supportive website , telemonitoring , telerehabilitation or teleconsultation .  All studies measured  patient-related outcomes  focusing on the  physical , the mental or the general component of recovery .  11 studies ( 40.7 % ) reported outcome  measures  related to the  effectiveness of the intervention in terms of health care usage and costs  . 25 studies ( 92.6 % ) reported at least an equal ( n = 8) or positive ( n = 17 ) effect of the  e-health intervention  compared to  usual care .  In two studies ( 7.4 % ) a positive effect on any  outcome  was found in favour of the control group . Conclusion Based on this systematic review we conclude that in the majority of the studies  e-health  leads to similar or improved clinical  patient-related  outcomes compared to only  face to face perioperative care  for  patients who have undergone various forms of surgery .  However , due to the low or moderate quality of many studies , the results should be interpreted with caution."
" There are no trials design ed to  reduce weight  in  obese pregnant women .  Until the safety of  weight loss  in obese pregnant women can be established , there can be no practice recommendations for these women to intentionally lose weight during the pregnancy period . Further study is required to explore the potential benefits , or harm , of  weight loss  in pregnancy when obese before weight loss interventions in pregnancy can be design ed . Qualitative research is also required to explore dietary habits of  obese pregnant women  , especially those who are morbidly obese."
"kInhaled  β₂-agonists  are commonly used as bronchodilators in the treatment of asthma . Their use in  athletes  , however , is restricted by anti-doping regulations . Controversies remain as to whether  healthy elite athletes who use bronchodilators  may gain a competitive advantage . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis is to assess the effects of  inhaled and systemic β₂-agonists  on physical performance in  healthy , non-asthmatic subjects .  To this end , MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) were search ed up to August 2009 . Reference lists were search ed for additional relevant studies . The search criteria were for r and omized controlled trials examining the effect of inhaled or systemic  β₂-agonists  on physical performance in  healthy , non-asthmatic subjects .  Two authors independently performed the selection of studies , data extraction and risk of bias assessment . Parallel-group and crossover trials were analysed separately  . Mean difference ( MD )  and  95 % confidence intervals  were calculated for continuous data and , where possible , data were pooled using a fixed effects model .  Twenty-six studies involving 403 participants ( age range 7 - 30 years )  compared inhaled  β₂-agonists with placebo .  No significant effect could be detected for inhaled β₂-agonists  on maximal oxygen consumption  ( VO₂(max ) ) [ MD -0.14 mL · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹ ; 95 % CI -1.07 , 0.78 ; 16  studies ] , endurance time to exhaustion at 105 -  110 % VO₂(max ) ( MD -1.5 s ; 95 % CI -15.6 , 12.6 ; four studies ) ,  20-km time trial  duration ( MD -4.4 s ; 95 % CI -23.5 , 14.7 ; two  studies ) , peak power  ( MD -0.14 W · kg⁻¹ ; 95 % CI -0.54 , 0.27 ; four  studies ) and total work during a 30-second Wingate  test ( MD 0.80 J · kg⁻¹ ; 95 % CI -2.44 , 4.05 ; five studies ) .  Thirteen studies involving 172 participants ( age range 7 - 22 years )  compared systemic  β₂-agonists with placebo  , with 12 studies involving oral and one study involving intravenous salbutamol . A significant effect was detected for systemic   β₂-agonists  on endurance time to exhaustion  at 80 - 85 % VO₂(max ) ( MD 402 s ; 95 % CI 34 , 770 ; two studies ) , but not for VO₂(max )  (  placebo 42.5 ± 1.7 mL · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹  , salbutamol  42.1 ± 2.9 mL · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹ , one  study )  ,  endurance time  to exhaustion at 70 % VO₂(max ) ( MD 400 s ; 95 % CI -408 , 1208 ; one study ) or power output at 90 % VO₂(max )  ( placebo  234.9 ± 16 W  , salbutamol  235.5 ± 18.1 W , one study ) . A significant effect was shown for systemic β₂-agonists  on peak power  ( MD 0.91 W · kg⁻¹ ; 95 % CI 0.25 , 1.57 ; four studies ) ,  but not on total work  ( MD 7.8 J · kg⁻¹ ; 95 % CI -3.3 , 18.9 ; four studies ) during a 30-second Wingate test . There were no r and omized controlled trials assessing the  effects  of  systemic formoterol , salmeterol or terbutaline  on physical performance . In conclusion , no significant effects were detected for inhaled β₂-agonists  on endurance , strength or sprint performance  in  healthy athletes .  There is some evidence indicating that systemic β₂-agonists may have a  positive effect on physical performance  in  healthy subjects  , but the evidence base is weak."
"sAbstract Background :  Patients visiting their GPs exceptionally often ( frequent attenders , FAs )  have high rates of somatic disease , emotional distress , psychiatric illnesses and social problems and require a disproportionate amount of their GPs ’ time . Objectives : To summarize which types of FA have been studied and what the effects of interventions were on  quality of life ( QoL ) , symptom severity of underlying illness(es ) and consultation frequency .  To discover when  patients  are  considered FAs .  Methods : Systematic review of RCTs using a comprehensive search ( MEDLINE , PsycINFO , CINAHL and EMBASE , from 1980 to August 2015 ) and no language restrictions . Two investigators extracted data . Results were summarized qualitatively . Results :  We included 17 RCTs .  Heterogeneity at the level of population s , interventions and outcomes precluded statistical pooling . In-depth analysis by GPs assessing a patient ’s reasons for frequent attendance decreased  consultation frequency  by four to six per year . A small effect on  symptom severity  was noted in depressed FAs , although this finding was not replicated in a recent trial .  Multi-component therapy and medication  in FAs with medically unexplained symptoms ( MUS )  improved QoL  ( SF36 odds ratio : 1.92 ; 95%CI : 1.08–3.40 )  and morbidity  ( CES-D 3.17 ; 95%CI : 1.27–5.08 ) . Conclusion : RCTs on intervention effects in frequent attenders to primary care used different patient population s , interventions , comparators and outcome measures . Consistent evidence on the effects of particular interventions in specific patient domains is lacking . A tailored approach based on in-depth analysis among GPs of potential reasons for frequent attendance may decrease  consultation frequency .  Research involving the screening and treating for FAs with MUS may be useful in future trials."
"yInfiltrating  lobular carcinoma ( ILC ) of the breast  is associated with greater oestrogen receptor expression and poorer response to  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  , when compared to infiltrating ductal carcinoma ( IDC ) . In order to compare the  pathological complete response rate ( pCR ) and  breast conserving surgery (  BCS  )   in  patients with ILC versus IDC treated with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy   , we performed a systematic review and meta- analysis of all published studies . A search of PubMed , EMBASE , the Web of Science , SCOPUS and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed to identify studies that investigated  pCR , clinical response and BCS  in  patients with ILC that were treated with  neoadjuvant chemotherapy .   R and om-effect models were adopted to estimate the  summary odds ratio (  OR ) , and the publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger ’s regression asymmetry test .  Seventeen studies were included  ( one r and omized controlled trial , three prospect i ve series and 13 retrospective trials ) , for a total of  12,645  IDCs and  1,764  ILCs to be compared . Ductal carcinoma of the breast was associated with a  better pCR  ( from 5.9 to 16.7 % ; OR = 3.1 , 95 % CI 2.48–3.87 , P < 0.00001 ) and  rate of BCS  ( from 35.4 to 54.8 % ; OR = 2.1 , 95 % CI 1.8–2.45 , P < 0.00001 ) compared to ILC . The  overall pCR rates and BCS  decreased in the ILCs compared with IDC when treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
"dNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is a frequent accompaniment of obesity and insulin resistance . With the prevalence approaching 85 % in obese population s , new therapeutic approaches to manage NAFLD are warranted . A systematic search of the literature was conducted for studies pertaining to the effect of  omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) supplementation  on  NAFLD in humans .  Primary outcome measures were  liver fat and liver function tests : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate aminotransferase [ 1 ]  . Data were pooled and meta-analyses conducted using a r and om effects model .  Nine eligible studies , involving 355 individuals given either  omega-3 PUFA or control treatment  were included .   Beneficial changes in liver fat  favoured  PUFA  treatment ( effect size=-0.97 , 95 % CI : -0.58 to -1.35 , p<0.001 ) . A benefit of  PUFA vs.  control was also observed for  AST  ( effect size=-0.97 , 95 % CI : -0.13 to -1.82 , p=0.02 ) . There was a trend towards favouring  PUFA  treatment on  ALT  but this was not significant ( effect size=-0.56 , 95 % CI : -1.16 to 0.03 , p=0.06 ) . Sub-analyses of only r and omised control trials ( RCTs ) showed a significant benefit for  PUFA vs. control  on  liver fat  ( effect size=-0.96 , 95 % CI : -0.43 to -1.48 , p<0.001 ) , but not for  ALT  ( p=0.74 ) or  AST  ( p=0.28 ) . There was significant heterogeneity between studies . The pooled data suggest that  omega-3 PUFA  supplementation may decrease  liver fat  , however , the optimal dose is currently not known . Well design ed RCTs which quantify the magnitude of effect of  omega-3 PUFA supplementation  on liver fat are needed."
"dBACKGROUND Pre- clinical evidence suggests a period early after stroke during which the brain is most receptive to rehabilitation , if it is provided as high-dose  motor  training  .  OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of  repetitive gait training  within the first 3 months post-stroke and the effects on  gait-specific outcomes .  METHODS PubMed , Web of Science , Cochrane Library , Rehab Data and PEDro data bases were search ed systematic ally . R and omized controlled trials were included to descriptively analyse the feasibility and quantitatively investigate the effectiveness of  repetitive gait training  compared with  conventional therapy .  RESULTS  Fifteen r and omized controlled trials were included  .  Repetitive training  can safely be provided through body weight support and locomotor assistance from therapists or a robotic device . No difference in  drop-out rates  was reported despite the dem and ing nature of the intervention . The meta- analysis yielded significant , but small , effects on  walking independence and endurance .  Training with end-effector robots appears most effective .  Robots enable a substantial , yet feasible , increase in the  quantity of walking practice  early post-stroke , which might enhance  functional recovery .  However , the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood."

"sOBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between  maternal depression and child growth in developing countries  through a systematic literature review and meta- analysis . METHODS Six data bases were search ed for  studies  from  developing countries on maternal depression and child growth  published up until 2010 . St and ard meta-analytical methods were followed and  pooled odds ratios ( ORs )  for  underweight and stunting  in the  children of depressed mothers  were calculated using r and om effects models for all studies and for subsets of studies that met strict criteria on study design , exposure to maternal depression and outcome variables . The  population attributable risk ( PAR )  was estimated for selected studies . FINDINGS  Seventeen studies including a total of 13,923 mother and child pairs from 11 countries met inclusion criteria . The children of mothers with depression or depressive symptoms  were more likely to be  underweight  ( OR : 1.5 ; 95 % confidence interval , CI : 1.2 - 1.8 ) or  stunted  ( OR : 1.4 ; 95 % CI : 1.2 - 1.7 ) . Sub analysis of three longitudinal studies showed a stronger effect : the  OR for underweight  was 2.2 ( 95 % CI : 1.5 - 3.2 ) and for  stunting  , 2.0 ( 95 % CI : 1.0 - 3.9 ) . The  PAR  for selected studies indicated that if the infant population were entirely unexposed to maternal depressive symptoms 23 % to 29 % fewer children would be  underweight or stunted .   Maternal depression was associated with  early  childhood  underweight and stunting .  Rigorous prospect i ve studies are needed to identify mechanisms and causes . Early identification , treatment and prevention of maternal depression may help reduce  child stunting and underweight  in developing countries."
"eThe purpose of the article is to summarize evidence and recommendations for   psychological interventions   in the rehabilitation of  patients with chronic low back pain .  We carried out a systematic literature search in several data bases and on the websites of professional associations to identify relevant review s and guidelines . In addition to the electronic search , a h and search was carried out .  Eligible publications were selected  . We extracted and summarized both evidence for  psychological interventions  and recommendations on  psychological diagnostics and interventions .  Six systematic review s and 14 guidelines were included . We collected recommendations and partially restricted evidence on the following  psychological interventions : behavioural therapy , fear-avoidance training , stress management , relaxation therapy , patient education and back school .  Most available evidence for  psychological interventions  in the rehabilitation of  patients with chronic low back pain  is of moderate to low quality . In addition , some of the older evidence is inapplicable to modern interventions using a biopsychosocial approach . Thus , high quality and current evidence is needed . The summary of guidelines shows that multimodal , multidisciplinary programmes including  psychological interventions  have become st and ard in the rehabilitation of  patients with chronic low back pain .  In most guidelines , however , there are no recommendations on which   ( psychological )  intervention  should be considered for which specific problem ( problem-treatment pairs ) . Suggestions for future research and future guidelines are made."

"sMixed  treatment comparison ( MTC )  meta-analyses estimate relative treatment effects from networks of evidence while preserving r and omisation . We extend the  MTC  framework to allow for repeated measurements of a continuous endpoint that varies over time . We used , as a case study , a systematic review and meta- analysis of   intraocular pressure ( IOP )  measurements from r and omised controlled trials evaluating  topical ocular hypotensives  in primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  because IOP varies over the day and over the treatment course , and repeated measurements are frequently reported . We adopted models for conducting  MTC  in  WinBUGS  ( The BUGS Project , Cambridge , UK ) to allow for repeated  IOP measurements  and to impute missing st and ard deviations of the raw data using the predictive distribution from observations with st and ard deviations . A flexible model with an unconstrained baseline for  IOP  variations over time and time-invariant r and om treatment effects fitted the data well . We also adopted repeated measures models to allow for class effects ; assuming treatment effects to be exchangeable within classes slightly improved model fit but could bias estimated treatment effects if exchangeability assumptions were not valid . We enabled all timepoints to be included in the analysis , allowing for repeated measures to increase precision around treatment effects and avoid bias associated with selecting timepoints for meta- analysis .The methods we developed for modelling repeated measures and allowing for missing data may be adapted for use in other MTC meta-analyses."
" The LABA/LAMA combination was the highest ranked treatment group to reduce  COPD exacerbations  although there was some uncertainty in the results . LAMA containing inhalers may have an advantage over those without a LAMA for preventing  COPD exacerbations  based on the rank statistics . Combination therapies appear more effective than monotherapies for improving  symptom and quality -of-life scores .  ICS-containing inhalers are associated with an increased  risk of pneumonia .  Our most comprehensive review including intraclass/group comparisons , free combination therapies ,  99  studies  , and 20 outcomes for each high- and low-risk population  summarises the current literature and could help with updating existing COPD guidelines."

"sOBJECTIVE To examine the effect of  motion-controlled commercial video games  compared with  traditional occupational and physiotherapy methods  for  h and and arm function  in  persons of all ages with cerebral palsy .  DATA SOURCES A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , OTseeker and PEDro for r and omized controlled trials involving  persons with cerebral palsy  using  motion-controlled commercial video games  as a training method for h and and arm function , compared with  traditional therapy .  STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Screening , data - extraction , risk of bias and quality assessment was carried out independently by 2 of the authors . The risk of bias of each study was assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations Risk of Bias Tool . The quality of evidence was assessed using Grading  of Recommendations Assessment ,  Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) . DATA SYNTHESIS  Eight r and omized controlled trials , with a total of 262 participants , were included .  A r and om effects meta- analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in favour of  motion-controlled commercial video games .  The quality  of  the evidence was , however , rated as very low .  Despite a significantly greater  improvement in h and and arm function  in favour of  motion-controlled commercial video games  , the results of this review should be interpreted with caution with regards to high risk of bias and the low strength of evidence . There is a need for high-powered studies on the effectiveness of training with  motion-controlled commercial video games  for  persons with cerebral palsy  , especially in adults."
" While many of the studies did not include multivariate analysis with confounder adjustment , the published evidence indicates a link between  joint damage  and  functional disability  and that an increase in joint damage is associated with an increase in  disability  over time . Treatments to limit progressive joint damage may lead to better joint function and improved patient outcome with less disability."
"CBACKGROUND We carried out a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the predictive roles of  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  ( TILs ) in response to  neoadjuvant chemotherapy (  NAC )  in breast cancer .  METHOD A PubMed and Web of Science literature search was design ed . R and om or fixed effect models were adopted to estimate the summary odds ratio ( OR ) . Heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity among studies and to assess the effects of study quality . Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot , Egger 's test and Begg 's test . We included studies where the predictive significance of   TILs  , and /or  TILs subset   on the  pathologic complete response ( pCR )  were determined in  NAC  of breast cancer . RESULTS  A total of 13 published studies ( including 3251 patients ) were eligible .  In pooled analysis , the detection of  higher TILs numbers  in pre-treatment biopsy was correlated with  better pCR  to NAC ( OR = 3.93 , 95 % CI , 3.26 - 4.73 ) . Moreover , TILs predicted  higher pCR rates  in triple negative ( OR = 2.49 , 95 % CI : 1.61 - 3.83 ) , HER2 positive ( OR = 5.05 , 95 % CI : 2.86 - 8.92 ) breast cancer , but not in estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive ( OR = 6.21 , 95%CI : 0.86 - 45.15 ) patients . In multivariate analysis ,  TILs  were still an independent marker for  high pCR rate  ( OR = 1.41 , 95 % CI : 1.19 - 1.66 ) . For TILs subset ,  higher levels of CD8 + and FOXP3 + T-lymphocytes  in pre-treatment biopsy respectively predicted  better pathological response to NAC  ( OR = 6.44 , 95 % CI : 2.52 - 16.46 ; OR = 2.94 , 95 % CI : 1.05 - 8.26 ) . Only  FOXP3 + lymphocytes  in post-NAC breast tissue were a predictive marker for  low pCR rate  in univariate ( OR = 0.41 , 95 % CI : 0.21 - 0.80 ) and multivariate ( OR = 0.36 , 95 % CI : 0.13 - 0.95 ) analysis .   Higher TILs levels  in pre-treatment biopsy indicated  higher pCR rates  for NAC . TILs subset played different roles in predicting response to NAC."
" Overall , by summarizing current evidence , we found that enhanced vaccines had  greater antibody responses  than  the  SD vaccine . Indications of differences among enhanced vaccines highlight the fact that further research is needed to compare new vaccine options , especially during seasons with mismatched circulating strains and for immune outcomes other than hemagglutination inhibition titers as well as vaccine efficacy."
"yObjective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of  virtual reality interventions  for improving  balance  and gait in  people with Parkinson ’s disease .  Design : This is a systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials . Methods : Data bases of MEDLINE , Cochran Central Register of Controlled Trials , EMBASE , PEDro , Web of Science and China Biology Medicine disc were search ed from their inception up to 1 March 2019 . Two review ers individually appraised literature s for inclusion , extracted data and evaluated trial quality . Results : A  total of 12 studies with a median PEDro score of 6.4 and involving 419 participants were included .  This review first demonstrated significant improvements  in Berg Balance Scale  ( mean difference = 2.69 ; 95 % confidence interval = 1.37 to 4.02 ; p <  0.0001  )  , Timed Up and Go Test  ( mean difference = −2.86 ; 95 % confidence interval = −5.60 to −0.12 ; p =  0.04 ) and stride length  ( mean difference = 9.65 ; 95 % confidence interval = 4.31 to 14.98 ; p = 0.0004 ) in  Parkinson patients  who received  virtual reality  compared with controls . However , there was no significant difference  in gait velocity and walk distance .  Conclusion : This systematic review and meta- analysis supports the use  of virtual reality  to enhance the  balance  of  patients with Parkinson ’s disease .  However , the review does not find any definite effect upon gait by the use of virtual reality."

" Current evidence does not demonstrate any  benefits or adverse effects  from the use of  respite care  for  people with dementia or their caregivers .  These results should be treated with caution , however , as they may reflect the lack of high quality research in this area rather than an actual lack of benefit . Given the frequency with which  respite care  is advocated and provided , well- design ed trials are needed in this area."

"AOsteoarthritis ( OA ) is one of the most common debilitating disorders among the  elderly population .  At present , there is no definite cure for the underlying causes of OA . However ,  adipose tissue-derived stem cells ( ADSCs )  in the form  of stromal vascular fraction ( SVF )  may offer an alternative at this time . ADSCs are one type of mesenchymal stem cells that have been utilized and have demonstrated an ability to  regenerate cartilage .  ADSCs have been shown to  regenerate cartilage  in a variety of animal models also .  Non-culture-exp and ed ADSCs  , in the form  of SVF  along with  platelet rich plasma ( PRP )  , have recently been used in humans to treat  OA and other cartilage abnormalities  . These ADSCs have demonstrated  effectiveness  without any  serious side effects .  However , due to regulatory issues , only ADSCs in the form of SVF are currently allowed for clinical uses in humans .  Culture-exp and ed ADSCs  , although more convenient , require clinical trials for a regulatory approval prior to uses in clinical setting s. Here we present a systematic review of currently available clinical studies involving ADSCs in the form of SVF and in the culture-exp and ed form , with or without PRP , highlighting the clinical effectiveness and  safety  in treating OA."
"eAbstract We did a systematic review and meta- analysis on the  efficacy and safety  of the  anti-TNF drugs adalimumab , etanercept , golimumab and infliximab  used in  psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) adult treatment .  Additionally , we present results of  anti-TNF  use in real life setting s. We search ed Embase , Medline , Cochrane Central and LILACS ,  from inception to 11/08/2013  , for studies comparing  anti-TNFs  with each other or with controls . We included  nine r and omized controlled trials and six observational studies .   ACR20 , ACR50 , PsARC and PASI75 responses  were achieved by more users of  anti-TNF  than control after up to 24 weeks of treatment .  More participants who used  etanercept  and  infliximab    achieved ACR70 .  After all patients originally r and omized to anti-TNF or placebo had used  anti-TNF  for at least 24 weeks , we observed difference only with regard to  ACR70 response . Radiographic end points  were achieved by more  patients in anti-TNF group  , and they seem to be time dependent — the longer patients use the drug the better the results .  Etanercept  and  infliximab  had worse results on  application site reactions  , but in general  anti-TNF drugs  in the regimens studied were  as safe  as  control/placebo .  There seems to be no difference in  efficacy and effectiveness  among  anti-TNFs  , but superiority head-to-head studies are still needed . Meanwhile , other factors should be taken into account in the choice of medication , such as costs and patient convenience."
"eAmong the current therapeutic approaches for the regeneration of  damaged articular  cartilage   , none has yet proven to offer results comparable to those of native hyaline cartilage . Recently , it has been cl aim ed that the use of  mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs )  provides greater regenerative  potential  than differentiated cells , such as chondrocytes . Among the different kinds of  MSCs  available ,  adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells  ( ADSCs ) are emerging due to their abundancy and easiness to harvest . However , their mechanism of action and potential for  cartilage regeneration  are still under investigation , and many other aspects still need to be clarified . The aim of this systematic review is to give an overview of in vivo studies dealing with ADSCs , by summarizing the main evidence for the treatment of cartilage disease of the knee."

"eColorectal  peritoneal metastases ( CPM )  are associated with  abbreviated survival and significantly impaired quality of life .  In patients with  CPM  , radical  multimodality treatment  consisting of  cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC )  has demonstrated oncological superiority over systemic chemotherapy alone . In  highly selected patients undergoing  CRS + HIPEC   , overall  survival  of over 60 % has been reported in some series . These are patients in whom the disease burden is limited and where the diagnosis is made at an early stage in the disease course . Early diagnosis and a deeper underst and ing of the biological mechanisms that regulate CPM are critical to refining patient selection for radical treatment , personalising therapeutic approaches , enhancing prognostication , and ultimately improving long-term survivorship . In the present study , we outline three broad themes which represent critical future research targets in CPM : ( 1 ) enhanced radiological strategies for early detection and staging ; ( 2 ) identification and validation of translational biomarkers for diagnostic , prognostic , and therapeutic deployment ; and ( 3 ) development of optimized approaches for surgical cytoreduction as well as more precise strategies for intraperitoneal drug selection and delivery . Herein , we provide a contemporary narrative review of the state of the art in these three areas . A systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines was undertaken on all English language studies published between 2007 and 2017 . In vitro and animal model studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the sections pertaining to biomarkers and therapeutic optimisation , as these areas of research currently remain in the early stages of development . Acquired data were then divided into hierarchical thematic categories ( imaging modalities , translational biomarkers ( diagnostic/prognostic/therapeutic ) , and delivery techniques ) and subcategories . An interactive sunburst figure is provided for intuitive interrogation of the CPM research l and scape."
"sBackground  Polycystic ovary syndrome  ( PCOS ) is a complex endocrine disorder with an estimated prevalence of 4–21 % in  reproductive aged women .  The altered metabolic and hormonal environment among women with PCOS may increase their risk of some types  of cancer  . Methods We performed a comprehensive review of the literature using numerous search terms for  all studies examining the associations between polycystic ovary syndrome and related characteristics and cancer published in English through October 2016 .  This review summarizes the epidemiological findings on the associations between PCOS and endometrial , ovarian , and breast cancers and discusses the method ological issues , complexities , and underlying mechanisms of these associations . Results We identified  11 individual studies and 3 meta-analyses on the associations between PCOS and endometrial cancer , 8 studies and 1 meta- analysis for ovarian cancer , and 10 studies and 1 meta- analysis for breast cancer .  Multiple studies reported that  women with PCOS  were at a higher  risk for endometrial cancer  ; however , many did not take into account  body mass index  (  BMI  ) , a strong and well-established risk factor for endometrial cancer . The association with  ovarian cancer  was less clear , but a  potentially increased risk of the borderline serous subtype  was reported by two studies . No consistent  association between PCOS risk and breast cancer  was observed . Conclusion The associations between PCOS and endometrial , ovarian , and breast  cancer  are complex , with the need to consider many method ological issues in future analyses . Larger well- design ed studies , or pooled analyses , may help clarify these complex associations."
">This systematic review and meta- analysis reports the efficacy of   post-natal physical activity change interventions   with content coding of  behaviour change techniques  ( BCTs ) . Electronic data bases ( MEDLINE , CINAHL and PsychINFO ) were search ed for  interventions published from January 1980 to July 2013 . Inclusion criteria were : ( i ) interventions including ≥1  BCT  design ed to change physical activity behaviour , ( ii ) studies reporting ≥1 physical activity outcome , ( iii ) interventions commencing later than four weeks after childbirth and ( iv ) studies including participants who had given birth within the last year .  Controlled trials were included in the meta- analysis . Interventions were coded using the 40-item Coventry , Aberdeen & London - Refined ( CALO-RE ) taxonomy of BCTs and study quality assessment was conducted using Cochrane criteria .  Twenty studies were included in the review ( meta- analysis : n = 14 ) .  Seven were  interventions  conducted  with healthy inactive post-natal women .  Nine were  post-natal weight management studies . Two studies included women with post-natal depression .  Two studies focused  on improving general well-being  . Studies in healthy population s but not for weight management  successfully changed physical activity . Interventions increased frequency but not volume of physical activity or walking behaviour  . Efficacious interventions always included  the BCTs  ‘ goal setting ( behaviour )  ’  and   ‘ prompt self-monitoring of behaviour  ’ ."

"CAbstract  Patients with early‐stage non – small‐cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) who are unable to undergo surgery can  be  offered  radiation therapy  (  RT  ) .  Previously ,  conventional RT  was offered ; however , newer techniques such as  stereotactic body RT ( SBRT )  have become available . The objective of the present systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of  RT  with curative intent in  patients with early‐stage medically inoperable NSCLC .  MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library were search ed for studies comparing  stereotactic RT with curative intent  compared with  observation  or other  types of RT  for early‐stage , medically inoperable , NSCLC . Comparisons of radiation dosing or fractionation schedules for  SBRT  were included . We include 4 systematic review s and 52 observational studies . The evidence suggests that  SBRT  compared with  observation  or other forms  of RT  , such as  accelerated hypofractionated RT , 3‐dimensional conformal RT , conventional fractionated RT , external beam RT , proton beam therapy , and carbon ion therapy  , could have similar or  improved results in survival or local control  , with similar or fewer  adverse effects .  Evidence also suggests that  local tumor control and survival  were associated with the biologically effective dose ( BED ) for  SBRT .  Several studies suggested a cutoff of approximately 100 BED correlated significantly with patient outcomes . The presented evidence suggests  that SBRT  compared with other forms of  RT  is a reasonable treatment option for patients with medically inoperable early‐stage NSCLC."
"sThis systematic review analyzes current data on effects of  exercise interventions and physical activity behavior  on  objective and subjective  cancer related cognitive impairments ( CRCI )  .  Out of the  19 studies  which met all inclusion criteria , five  RCTs investigated rodents  , whereas the other  14 trials explored humans  and these included six RCTs , one controlled trial , two prospect i ve noncontrolled trials , one case series , one observational study , and three cross-sectional studies . The results from animal models revealed positive  effects  of exercise during and after  chemotherapy  or  radiation  on  structural alterations of the central nervous system , physiological as well as neuropsychological outcomes .  The overall study quality in patient studies was poor . The current data on intervention studies showed preliminary positive effects of  Asian-influenced movement programs (  e.g. ,  Yoga )  with benefits  on self-perceived cognitive functions  as well as a  reduction of chronic inflammation  for  breast cancer patients  in the aftercare .  Exercise  potentially contributes to the prevention and rehabilitation of  CRCI  . Additional RCTs with st and ardized  neuropsychological  assessment s and controlling for potential confounders are needed to confirm and exp and preliminary findings."
"eThe  pressurized metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers  are the most widely used devices for inhalation therapy in  asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ;  each of these devices have certain advantages and disadvantages that impact their use .

"eBACKGROUND  Long-acting beta(2)-agonists ( LABAs )  are recommended as add-on therapy to antiinflammatory treatment in  patients with chronic persistent asthma .  Results from individual studies evaluating the in vivo antiinflammatory effect of  LABAs  are conflicting . The purpose of this meta analysis was to determine whether  LABAs  have an in vivo  antiinflammatory effect  compared to placebo and whether the addition of a  LABA  to therapy with  inhaled corticosteroids  ( ICSs ) has a synergistic or additive antiinflammatory effect . METHODS A systematic search was performed of online data bases for r and omized controlled trials evaluating the antiinflammatory effects of the following : ( 1 )  LABAs compared  to  placebo ;  and ( 2 )  a LABA plus ICS vs ICS alone  in  adults and children with asthma .  Inflammatory outcome measures included  cell counts and markers of cell activation in sputum , BAL fluid , bronchial biopsy specimens , serum , and exhaled nitric oxide ( ENO ) .  Data were independently extracted by two study investigators and analyzed to generate st and ardized mean differences using either a fixed or r and om-effects meta analysis depending on the degree of heterogeneity . RESULTS  Thirty-two studies ( n = 1,105 participants ) met the inclusion criteria .  The mean number of participants and mean  number of studies  for each  inflammatory outcome  in the meta analysis was 113.1 ( SD , 46.2 ) and 3.5 ( SD , 1.3 ) , respectively . There was no effect of  LABA therapy  on  sputum , BAL fluid , or mucosal inflammatory cells  in adults or in children .  LABA  therapy decreased  ENO levels and BAL fluid albumin levels  in adults . In children ,  LABA  therapy was associated with a small decrease in  serum eosinophils and interleukin-4 .    LABA therapy  does not appear to have any clinical ly important antiinflammatory or proinflammatory effect .  LABA therapy  decreases  BAL fluid albumin levels  , suggesting a possible modulating effect on microvascular leakage."

"dBackground  Caffeine  is widely consumed , and its effect on  intraocular pressure ( IOP )  has been reported in conflicting data . The aim of this meta- analysis was to quantitatively summarize the effect of  caffeine  on   IOP  in normal individuals and in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension ( OHT ) .  Methods A comprehensive literature search was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration methodology to identify pertinent r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , PubMed and EMBASE . A systematic review and meta- analysis was performed .  IOP  at 0.5 hour ( h ) , 1 h and 1.5 h after  caffeine  ingestion was the main outcome measurement . Results Six RCTs ( two parallel- design ed and four crossover- design ed ) evaluating  144 participants  fulfilled inclusion criteria . The risk of bias for these studies was uncertain . Among the  participants  ,  103 were normal individuals and 41 were patients with glaucoma or OHT .  In normal individuals , the  IOPs  measured at 0.5 h , 1 h and 1.5 h post-intervention were not affected by ingestion of caffeine . The  weighted mean difference ( WMD )  with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95%CI ) for each measurement point were −0.740 ( –2.454 , 0.974 ) , 0.522 ( –0.568 , 1.613 ) and 0.580 ( –1.524 , 2.684 ) . However , in patients with glaucoma or OHT  , IOP  increased at each measurement point , with the WMD and 95%CI being 0.347 ( 0.078 , 0.616 ) , 2.395 ( 1.741,3.049 ) and 1.998 ( 1.522,2.474 ) respectively . No publication bias was detected by either Begg ’s or Egger ’s test . Conclusion Available evidence s showed that caffeine had different effects  on IOP  in different groups of individuals . For normal individuals  , IOP  was not changed by ingestion of  caffeine  , while for patients with glaucoma or OHT ,  IOP  increased significantly . More high- quality RCTs are warranted to confirm this . The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the clinical significance are to be explored."
"7INTRODUCTION  Damage to peripheral nerves  occurs in a variety of health conditions . Preserving nerve integrity , to prevent progressive  nerve  damage , remains a clinical challenge .  Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  ( PUFAs ) are implicated in the development and maintenance of healthy nerves and may be beneficial for promoting peripheral nerve health . The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effects of  oral omega-3 PUFA supplementation  on  peripheral nerve integrity  , including both subjective and  objective  measures of  peripheral nerve structure and /or function .  METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of r and omised controlled trials that have evaluated the effects of  omega-3 PUFA supplementation  on  peripheral nerve assessment  s will be conducted .

"sAim Several drugs have been used for treating  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) .  The present study is a network meta- analysis of such drugs . Design , setting and patients R and omised clinical trials comparing drug interventions in  patients with NAFLD  were analysed . OR and weighted mean difference ( 95 % CI ) were the effect estimates for categorical and numerical outcomes , respectively . R and om-effects model was used to generate pooled estimates . Surface under the cumulative ranking curve was used to rank the treatments . Main outcome measures  Proportion of responders  was the primary outcome measure and  non-alcoholic steatohepatitis scores , liver enzymes , lipid profile , body mass index , homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance , intrahepatic fat and adverse events  were the key secondary outcomes . Results  116 studies were included in the systematic review and 106 in the meta- analysis .    Elafibranor , gemfibrozil , metadoxine , obeticholic acid , pentoxifylline , pioglitazone , probiotics , telmisartan , vildagliptin and vitamin E  significantly increased the response rate  than st and ard of care . Various other drugs were observed to modify the  secondary outcomes  favourably .  Probiotics  was found with a  better response  in  children ;  and   elafibranor , obeticholic acid , pentoxifylline and pioglitazone   in  patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  . The quality of evidence observed was either low or very low . Conclusion In  patients with NAFLD  , several drugs have been shown to have variable  therapeutic  benefit . However , the estimates and the inferences should be considered with extreme caution as it might change with the advent of future head-to-head clinical trials."
"dCareful review s and meta-analyses have made valuable contributions to underst and ing the efficacy of  psychosocial interventions  for  cancer patients .  An important next step is to determine the mediators that explain the influence of efficacious interventions on outcomes . This systematic review summarizes tests of mediating variables from  twenty-two projects conducted from 1989–2010 .  Although all authors provided some type of rationale for considering particular mediating relationships , the investigations varied widely with respect to the extent to which formal theoretical constructs were tested , the type and goals of the interventions studied , and the broad types of outcomes and potential mediators examined . Although there was some evidence supporting selected mediating relationships , with positive findings often found when mediating  variables  represented behaviors targeted by an intervention , the findings were mixed . Exp and ing the focus of research to include mechanisms in psychosocial oncology intervention research is necessary for providing a unified picture of how mediating relationships may be operating in this field."
"sMuscle  energy techniques  are applied to reduce  pain and increase range of motion .  These are applied to a variety of pathological conditions and on  asymptomatic subjects .  There is however limited knowledge on their effectiveness and which protocol may be the most beneficial . The aim of this review is to determine the  efficacy  of   muscle energy techniques ( MET )   in  symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects .  Systematic Review . A literature search was performed using the following data base : Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , NLM Pubmed and ScienceDirect . Studies regarding  MET  in  asymptomatic and symptomatic patients  were considered for investigation . The main outcomes took into account  range of motion , chronic and acute pain and trigger points .  Two trained investigators independently screened  eligible studies  according to the eligibility criteria , extracted data and assessed risk of bias . R and omized control trials ( RCT ’s ) were analyzed for quality using the PEDro scale . A  total of 26 studies were considered eligible  and included in the quantitative synthesis :  14  regarding  symptomatic patients and 12 regarding asymptomatic subjects .  Quality assessment of the studies through the PEDro scale observed a “ moderate to high ” quality of the included records .  MET are an effective treatment for reducing chronic and acute pain of the lower back . MET are also effective in treating chronic neck pain and chronic lateral epicondylitis . MET  can be applied to  increase range of motion of a joint  when a functional limitation is present . Other techniques seem to be  more appropriate  compared to MET for trigger points."
" It is uncertain whether  Tai Chi  has any effect on clinical outcomes  ( joint pain , activity limitation , function )  in RA , and important effects can not be confirmed or excluded , since all outcomes had very low- quality evidence . Withdrawals from study were greater in the control groups than the  Tai Chi  groups , based on low- quality evidence . Although the incidence of adverse events is likely to be low with  Tai Chi  , we are uncertain , as studies failed to explicitly report such events . Few  minor adverse events ( joint and muscle soreness and cramps )  were described qualitatively in the narrative of two of the studies . This up date d review provides minimal change in the conclusions from the previous review , i.e. a pain outcome."
"sTo systematic ally review evidence regarding the benefits of  Internet-based psycho-educational interventions  among  cancer patients .  We performed a systematic review with meta- analysis and qualitative evidence synthesis . Systematic search es for published  studies in English or Chinese identified eligible r and omized and clinical controlled trials  . The following data bases were search ed : Medline , Embase , CINAHL , PsycINFO , Web of Science , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , Proquest Digital Dissertations , Foreign Medical Retrieval System ,  China  National Knowledge Infrastructure ,  China Science  and  Technology  Journal  Data  base ,  China Wanfang Data base , and Taiwanese Airiti Library .  We also search ed the gray literature and review ed reference lists from relevant articles . Studies were scored for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool .  Seven eligible studies ( 1220 participants ) were identified  that used three intervention tools  : website programs  ( n = 5 )  , e-mail counseling  ( n = 1 ) , and  a single-session psycho-educational intervention  ( n = 1 ) . The quality of all studies was moderate . The meta- analysis showed  that Internet-based psycho-educational interventions  had a significant effect on  decreasing depression  ( st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) − 0.58 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( − 1.12 , − 0.03 ) , p = 0.04  ) and fatigue  ( mean difference ( MD ) − 9.83 , 95 % CI ( − 14.63 , − 5.03 ) , p < 0.01 ) . However , there was no evidence for effects  on distress  ( SMD − 1.03 , 95 % CI ( − 2.63 , 0.57 ) ,  p  =  0.21 ) or quality of life  ( MD 1.10 , 95 % CI ( − 4.42 , 6.63 ) ,  p = 0.70 ) .

 There is moderate-level evidence that  abatacept  is  efficacious and safe  in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis .  Abatacept  should not be used in combination with other biologics to treat rheumatoid arthritis . The  withdrawal and toxicity profile  appears acceptable at the present time but further long-term studies and post-marketing surveillance are required to assess harms and sustained efficacy.
"sSummary Recent advances in telecommunication technologies have boosted the possibility to deliver  rehabilitation  via the internet ( i.e.  telerehabilitation )  . Several studies have shown that  telerehabilitation  is effective to improve  clinical outcomes  in disabling conditions . The aim of this review was to determine whether  telerehabilitation  was more effective than other modes of delivering rehabilitation to regain motor function , in  different population s of patients .  We search ed PubMed , Embase  and the Cochrane library retrieving 2360 records . Twelve studies were included involving different population s ( i.e. neurological , total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , cardiac ) of patients .  Inconclusive finding were found on the  effect of telerehabilitation  for neurological patients ( SMD = 0.08 , CI 95 % = −0.13 , 0.29 ) , while both for cardiac ( SMD = 0.24 , CI 95 % = 0.04 , 0.43 ) and TKA patients ( Timed Up and Go test : MD = −5.17 , CI 95 % = −9.79 , −0.55 ) the results were in favour of  telerehabilitation .  Conclusive evidence on  the efficacy of  telerehabilitation  for treatment of motor function  , regardless of pathology , was not reached . Nevertheless , a  strong positive effect  was found for  patients following orthopaedic surgery  , suggesting that the increased intensity provided by  telerehabilitation  is a promising option to be offered to patients . More and higher quality research is needed in this field especially with neurological patients."
"yAuditory entrainment can influence gait performance in movement disorders . The entrainment can incite neurophysiological and musculoskeletal changes to enhance motor execution . However , a consensus as to its effects based on gait in  people with cerebral palsy  is still warranted . A systematic review and meta- analysis were carried out to analyze the effects of  rhythmic auditory cueing  on  spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters of gait  in  people with cerebral palsy .  Systematic identification of published literature was performed adhering to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses and American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine guidelines , from inception until July 2017 , on online data bases : Web of Science , PEDro , EBSCO , Medline , Cochrane , Embase and ProQuest .  Kinematic and spatiotemporal gait parameters  were evaluated in a meta- analysis across studies .  Of 547 records , nine studies involving 227 participants ( 108 children/119 adults ) met our inclusion criteria .  The qualitative review suggested  beneficial effects of rhythmic  auditory cueing  on gait performance  among all included studies . The meta- analysis revealed  beneficial effects of rhythmic auditory  cueing   on  gait dynamic index  ( Hedge 's g=0.9 ) ,  gait velocity  ( 1.1 ) ,  cadence  ( 0.3 ) , and  stride length  ( 0.5 ) . This review for the first time suggests a converging evidence toward application of  rhythmic auditory cueing  to enhance  gait performance and stability  in  people with cerebral palsy .  This article details underlying neurophysiological mechanisms and use of cueing as an efficient home-based intervention . It bridges gaps in the literature , and suggests translational approaches on how  rhythmic auditory cueing  can be incorporated in rehabilitation approaches to enhance  gait performance  in people with cerebral palsy."

" To date , we have found evidence of generally low quality from studies comparing pressure support  ventilation ( PSV )  and  with a T-tube .  The effects on  weaning success , ICU mortality , reintubation , ICU and LWU length of stay , and pneumonia  were imprecise . However ,  PSV  was more effective than a  T-tube  for successful spontaneous breathing trials ( SBTs ) among  patients  with simple weaning . Based on the findings of single trials , three studies presented a shorter  weaning duration  in the group undergoing  PS SBT  , however a fourth study found a shorter  weaning duration  with a T-tube."

"SPolycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a common endocrine disorder , with complex etiology and pathophysiology , which remains poorly understood . It affects about 5 - 10 % of women of reproductive age who typically suffer from obesity , hyper and rogenism , ovarian dysfunction , and menstrual irregularity . Indeed , PCOS is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility in industrialized nations , and it is associated with insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and increased cardiovascular risk . Although insulin resistance is not included as a criterion for diagnosis , it is a critical pathological condition of PCOS . The purpose of this systematic review is the analysis of recent r and omized clinical trials of  inositol(s )  in PCOS , in particular  myo- and D-chiro-inositol  , in order to better eluci date their physiological involvement in PCOS and potential therapeutic use , alone and in conjunction with assisted  reproductive  technologies , in the clinical treatment of women with PCOS."
",cause  of cancer-related death .  CRC was responsible for 11 % of cancer-related deaths in  males  , and for 15 % of cancer-related deaths in  females  according to data for year 2000 . Most recent data reported in  Spain  on  death causes  in 2002 suggest that CRC was responsible for  12,183  deaths  ( 6,896 males with a mean age of 70 years , and 5,287 women with a mean age of 71 years ) .  In these tumors ,  mortality data  do not reflect the true incidence of this disease , since survival has improved in recent years , particularly in younger individuals . In contrast to other European countries , Spain ranks in an intermediate position in terms of CRC-related incidence and mortality . This risk clearly increases with age , with a notorious rise in incidence from 50 years of age on . Survival following CRC detection and management greatly depends upon tumor stage at the time of diagnosis ; hence the importance of early detection and –because of their malignant potential– of the recognition and excision of colorectal adenomas . Thus ,  polypectomy and then surveillance  are the primary cornerstones in the prevention of CRC ( 1 - 4 ) . For primary prevention ,  fiber-rich diets , physical exercising , and the avoidance of overweight , smoking , and alcohol  have been recommended .  Low-dose NSAIDs or ASA  are still not recommended for the prevention of CRC as of today ( 1 ) . CRC develops through well-established stages from lesions in colonic gl and crypts to adenomas to cancer . The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is characterized by cumulative mutations in both suppressor genes and oncogenes , which affect the balance between cell  proliferation  and apoptosis ; thus , each mutational event confers tumor cells with a growth advantage entailing a clonal expansion along multiple stages , and ultimately tumor progression ( 5 ) . From all the above , CRC screening is warranted : a ) this tumor has a high incidence and results in  severe morbidity and mortality ;  b ) the premalignant potential of colorectal adenomas is well known ; c ) the tumor may be detected using highly sensitive endoscopic  techniques  ; and d ) early management  improves survival .  The population  with a moderate risk for CRC  includes  individuals older than 50 years with no additional risk factors ( family members with CRC or adenomas , chronic inflammatory bowel disease ) .  Regarding the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening , Pignone et al. ( 6 ) performed a systematic review of this problem , and concluded that screening is cost-effective versus non-screening . The most cost-effective screening option for each population area or country remains to be established , as well as as its financial impact on healthcare systems ( 7 - 9 ) . While no first-choice screening option has been established in our setting thus far , any one of those discussed below is more  effective  than non-screening  .

"eAsthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization . Acute management involves  severity-based treatment  of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation . Optimal treatment has been defined and st and ardized through r and omized controlled trials , systematic review s , and consensus guidelines . Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve  clinical , quality , and safety  outcomes .  Asthma morbidity  is disproportionately high  in poor , urban , and minority children . Children  treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent  chronic severity , significant morbidity  , and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care , and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate."
" At present , we do not have sufficient high quality evidence to determine the effects of  n-3PUFAs  as a treatment for  MDD .  Our primary analyses suggest a small-to-modest , non-  clinical ly beneficial  effect of  n-3PUFAs  on  depressive symptomology  compared to  placebo ;  however the estimate is imprecise , and we judged the quality of the evidence on which this result is based to be low/very low . Sensitivity analyses , funnel plot inspection and comparison of our results with those of large well-conducted trials also suggest that this effect estimate is likely to be biased towards a positive finding for  n-3PUFAs  , and that the true effect is likely to be smaller . Our data , however , also suggest  similar rates of adverse events and numbers  failing to complete trials in  n-3PUFA  and  placebo  groups , but again our estimates are very imprecise . The one study that directly compares  n-3PUFAs  and antidepressants in our review finds comparable benefit . More evidence , and more complete evidence , are required , particularly regarding both the potential positive and negative effects of  n-3PUFAs  for MDD."
" In  children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma  , there was low quality evidence that intermittent  and daily  ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of  severe adverse health  events . The strength of the evidence means that we can not currently assume equivalence between the two options ..  Daily  ICS was superior  to  intermittent ICS in  several indicators of lung function , airway inflammation , asthma control and reliever use  . Both treatments  appeared safe  , but a  modest growth suppression  was associated with daily , compared to intermittent ,  inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone  . Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option , taking into account the unknown long-term ( > one year ) impact of intermittent therapy on  lung growth and lung function  decline."

"sSummary This systematic review identified  patients have unmet information needs about the nature of osteoporosis , medication , self-management and follow-up .  Clinician knowledge and attitudes appear to be of key importance in determining whether these needs are met . Unmet information needs appear to have psychosocial consequences and result in poor treatment adherence . Purpose  Patient education  is an integral component of the management of osteoporosis , yet patients are dissatisfied with the information they receive and see this as an area of research priority . This study aim ed to describe and summarise the specific expressed information needs of  patients in previously published qualitative research .  Methods Using terms relating to osteoporosis , fragility fracture and information needs ,  seven data bases were  search ed . Articles were screened using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria . Full-text articles selected for inclusion underwent data extraction and quality appraisal . Findings were drawn together using narrative synthesis . Results The search identified  11,024 articles .  Sixteen empirical studies were included in the review . Thematic analysis revealed three overarching themes relating to specific information needs , factors influencing whether information needs are met and the impact of unmet information needs . Specific information needs identified included the following : the nature of  osteoporosis/fracture  risk ; medication ; self-management and underst and ing the role of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and follow-up .  Perceived physician knowledge and attitudes  , and  the attitudes , beliefs and behaviours of patients  were important factors in influencing whether information needs were met , in addition to context ual factors and the format of educational re sources . Failure to elicit and address information needs appears to be associated with  poor treatment adherence , deterioration of the doctor-patient relationship and important psychosocial consequences .  Conclusion This is the first study to describe the information needs of  patients with osteoporosis and fracture  , the impact of this information gap and possible solutions . Further research is needed to co- design and evaluate  educational interventions  with patients."
"yConducting rigorous  psychosocial intervention  research with  cancer patients  has many challenges including encouraging them to join studies , asking them to engage in  interventions  or be part of  control conditions  , and to provide data over follow-up assessment s. Here , we highlight valuable insights regarding such challenges provided by investigators study ing psychosocial  interventions  for  cancer patients .  H and ling these skillfully has important implication s for the internal and external validity of this research and the ethical treatment of participants . Challenges noted in research reports included in a systematic review of 25 years of research ( comprising 488 unique projects ) investigating interventions design ed to enhance  cancer patients '   quality of life  were compiled . Among the difficulties mentioned was the fact that patients may not feel the need for psychosocial interventions and thus may not be interested in joining an intervention study . Patients who do feel the need for such interventions may be deterred from joining trials by the prospect of being r and omized to a nonpreferred group ; if they do join a trial , participants may be  disappointed  , drop out , or seek compensatory additional assistance when they are assigned to a control group . Apart from r and omization , other aspects of research may be off-putting to participants or potential participants , such as the language of consent forms or the intrusiveness of questions being asked . Potential remedies , such as research awareness interventions , monetary incentives , partnering with cancer support organizations , and using design s that take preferences into account merit consideration and further research inquiry."

"eAIM The aim of this study was to explicate the outcomes of   home support  interventions  for  older people with dementia and /or their carers  to inform clinical practice , policy and research . BACKGROUND Most  people with dementia  receive support at home . However , components and effectiveness of  home support interventions  have been little explored . DESIGN Systematic review with narrative summary . DATA SOURCES Electronic search es of published  studies in English  using PubMed , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , PsychINFO , CINAHL , Applied Social Science Index and CSA Social Services Abstract s. Data bases and sources were search ed from inception to April  2014  with no date restrictions to locate studies . REVIEW METHODS The PRISMA statement was followed and established systematic review methods used . Using  14 components of care for people with dementia and their carers  , identified previously , data across studies were synthesized . Interventions were grouped and described and effectiveness ratings applied . Qualitative studies were synthesized using key themes . RESULTS Seventy studies ( four qualitative ) were included . Most were directed to carers and of high quality . Seven interventions for carers and two for people with dementia were identified , covering 81 % of studies . Those relating to daily living , cognitive training and physical activity for people with dementia were absent . Measures of effectiveness were influenced mainly by the intensity  ( duration  and  frequency  ) of interventions . Those containing  education , social support  and  behaviour management  appeared most effective .  These interventions reflect emergent patterns of home support . Research is required to identify effective interventions linked to the stage of dementia , which can be applied as part of routine clinical care."
"hAbstract Background  Mothers and their offspring  may benefit from  lifestyle interventions   during pregnancy .  We systematic ally review ed the literature to map and evaluate the quality of long-term  offspring  outcomes in follow-up cohorts of r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Methods We search ed MEDLINE , EMBASE ,  CINAHL  ,  Data base of Abstract s of Review s of Effects and Cochrane Central ( until March 2019 ) for all RCTs evaluating any  lifestyle ( diet or exercise ) intervention  during pregnancy and their follow-up cohorts .  Two review s evaluated the extracted outcomes using two st and ardised assessment tools , one for quality of reporting ( score range 0–6 ) and another for the variation in outcome selection . We extracted data in duplicate and reported using natural frequencies , medians , ranges , means and st and ard deviation ( SD ) . Results We captured  30  long-term offspring  outcomes reported in six articles ( four studies ) .   Offspring anthropometric measurements  were the most commonly reported outcomes . There was a large variation in the measurement tools used . The  mean overall quality score  for outcome reporting was 3.33 ( SD 1.24 ) , with poor reporting of secondary outcomes and limited justification for the choice of the reported outcomes . Most studies showed selective reporting for both their primary and secondary outcomes . Conclusion The quality of reporting for  long-term  offspring outcomes following  lifestyle interventions   in pregnancy  is varied with evidence of selective outcome reporting . Developing a core outcome set will help to reduce the variations in outcome reporting to optimise future research."
"aObjective : Bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) is a representative feature of asthma . Although  methacholine and mannitol  are commonly used for bronchial challenge tests , the optimal roles of the two agents for assessing BHR remain unclear . We compared the diagnostic performance of  methacholine and mannitol  in bronchial challenge tests . Methods : A systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register . The  sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic odds ratio ( DOR )  , and a  hierarchical summary  of the  receiver-operating characteristic curve ( HSROC  ) of the two agents for detecting BHR in asthma were pooled using meta- analysis . A meta-regression analysis was used to identify potential sources of heterogeneity within the selected studies . Results :  We identified six studies comprising 565 patients .  The  pooled sensitivity , specificity , and DOR  of methacholine were 0.61 ( 95%CI , 0.44 - 0.76 ) , 0.93 ( 95%CI , 0.70 - 0.99 ) , and 23.47 ( 95 % CI , 2.51- 219.89 ) , respectively . The  pooled sensitivity , specificity , and diagnostic odds ratio  of  mannitol  were 0.50 ( 95%CI , 0.28 to 0.73 ) , 0.97 ( 95 % CI , 0.94 to 0.99 ) , and 35.22 ( 95 % CI , 8.82 to 140.62 ) , respectively . The  area under the HSROC  for  mannitol  was higher than that for methacholine ( 0.97 vs. 0.81 , p < 0.01 ) . Considerable between- study heterogeneity was present for sensitivity and specificity in studies of both index tests . Univariate meta-regression analysis revealed that age and sex of the study participants were probable sources of heterogeneity for specificity in studies of methacholine . Conclusion : Although  mannitol  showed better diagnostic performance than methacholine for identifying BHR in asthma , substantial between- study heterogeneity necessitates caution when interpreting the data."
"yPatient  satisfaction  is an important measure of the quality of health care and is used as an outcome measure in interventional and quality improvement studies . Previous studies have found that there are few appropriately developed and vali date d question naires available . The authors conducted a systematic review to identify all tools used to measure   patient satisfaction  with anesthesia  , which have undergone a psychometric development and validation process , appraised the quality of these processes , and made recommendations of tools that may be suitable for use in different clinical and academic setting s. There are a number of robustly developed and subsequently vali date d instruments , however , there are still many studies using nonvali date d instruments or poorly developed tools , cl aim ing to accurately assess  satisfaction  with anesthesia . This can lead to biased and inaccurate results . Research ers in this field should be encouraged to use available vali date d tools , to ensure that  patient satisfaction  is measured and reported fairly and accurately."
"dLong-chain  ( n-3 ) PUFA ( LC-PUFA )  have been hypothesized to be beneficial in preventing pancreatic carcinogenesis , but the associations of  fish or LC-PUFA  intake with pancreatic cancer found in epidemiologic studies have been controversial and inconclusive . To estimate the overall association of  LC-PUFA or fish intake  with pancreatic cancer , we performed a systematic literature search of  English- language articles using PubMed and EMBASE through February  2012 and review ed the reference lists from retrieved articles .  Prospect  i  ve cohort or case-control studies  that reported ratio estimates and corresponding 95 % CI for the associations of  fish or LC-PUFA intake  and pancreatic cancer were selected . Independent data extraction was performed by 2 of the authors . The pooled associations were obtained by using a r and om-effects model . A data base was derived from  9 independent cohorts that included 1,209,265 participants ( 3082 events ) with a mean follow-up of 9 y and 10 independent case-control studies that included 2514 cases and 18,779 controls .  Compared with those having the lowest fish consumption ,  the pooled RR of pancreatic cancer  was 0.98 ( 95 % CI : 0.86 , 1.12 ) for those who had the highest fish intake from 8 cohort studies and was 0.96 ( 95 % CI : 0.76 , 1.21 ) from 9 case-control studies . We found similar results for  LC-PUFA intake  by combining data from 4 cohorts or 2 case-control studies . Our results do not support an  overall inverse association of  fish  or  LC-PUFA  intake with risk of pancreatic cancer .  Further studies that consider different species and preparation methods of fish , and additional adjustment for contaminants in fish , are warranted."
"sBACKGROUND The risk of getting influenza and pneumococcal disease is higher in  cancer patients  , and serum antibody levels tend to be lower in  patients with hematological malignancy .  OBJECTIVE To assess  flu and pneumococcal vaccinations   efficacy , effectiveness , and safety  in  onco-hematological patients .  METHODS Two systematic review s and possible meta- analysis were conducted to summarize the results of all primary study in the scientific literature about the  flu  and  pneumococcal vaccine  in  onco-hematological patients .  Literature search es were performed using Pub-Med and Scopus data bases . StatsDirect 2.8.0 was used for the analysis . RESULTS  22 and 26 studies were collected respectively  for  flu  and  pneumococcal vaccinations  .  Protection rate  of  booster  dose was 30 % ( 95 % CI=6 - 62 % ) for H1N1 .  Pooled prevalence protection rate of H3N2 and  B was available for meta- analysis only for first dose , 42.6 % ( 95 % CI=23.2 - 63.3 % ) and 39.6 % ( 95 % CI=26%-54.1 % ) for H3N2 and B , respectively .  Response rate of booster dose  result ed 35 % ( 95 % CI=19.7 - 51.2 % ) for H1N1 , 23 % ( 95 % CI=16.6 - 31.5 % ) for H3N2 , 29 % ( 95 % CI=21.3 - 37 % ) for B.  Despite the low rate of response ,  flu  , and  pneumococcal vaccines  are worthwhile for  patients with hematological malignancies . Patients undergoing chemotherapy in particular rituximab , splenectomy , transplant recipient  had lower and impaired  response .  No serious  adverse events  were reported for both vaccines."
"sIntroduction : It has been proposed that the use of  cue-reminders  may increase the  effectiveness  of interventions that aim to prevent health-risk behaviors ( i.e. , having unsafe sex , unhealthy dietary intake , lack of physical activity , and substance use ) . The aim of this systematic review was to explore whether there is evidence supporting this proposition , and to explore how  cue-reminders  are applied in health-risk behavior interventions to date . Method : We systemically review ed  ( non- ) r and omized trials  that examine  differences in health-risk behaviors between an experimental group receiving an  intervention with exposure to a cue-reminder  and a  control group receiving the intervention without such cue .   Results :  Six studies were eligible for inclusion .  The studies differed in sample and research design , and how the  cue-reminder  was applied . One study demonstrated a  positive and small effect  , and one study found a  negative medium effect  of the cue-reminder . In the remaining studies , the  effect sizes  were positive but non-significant . Discussion : It is unclear whether complementing health-risk behavior interventions with  cue-reminders  increases the  effectiveness  of these interventions . Further investigation and experimentation into the  efficiency and effectiveness  of  cue-reminders  is needed before health-risk behavior interventions are complemented with cue-reminders."
"eBackground Although  physical exercise  is recommended for  asthmatics  , evidence on the effects of  exercise  on clinical key factors is still missing . Objectives We performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to determine the effect of  exercise training  ( EXT ) on  quality of life ( QoL ) , bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) , exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) , lung function and exercise capacity  , plus the factors affecting changes in QoL and exercise capacity in  asthmatics  after a period of EXT . Data Sources A computerized search was conducted in MEDLINE , EMBASE , and CINAHL ( last search on 15 November 2012 ) , without language restriction , and references of original studies and review s were search ed for further relevant studies . Study Selection Two independent investigators  screened full-text studies with asthmatic subjects undertaking EXT ( defined as training for ≥7 days , ≥2 times per week  ,  ≥5 training sessions  in total  ) that  assessed at least one of the following  outcomes : QoL , airway hyperreactivity , forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) , inflammatory parameters , exercise capacity , or exercise endurance .  Potentially relevant studies were excluded if only  respiratory muscle training , breathing exercises or yoga  was performed , if  asthmatic subjects  with co-morbidities were investigated , if only data of mixed patient groups without separate results for asthmatics were presented , if training regimens were not sufficiently specified , if no numerical outcome data were presented , and if new long-term medication was introduced in addition to physical training .  Of 500 potentially relevant articles , 13.4 % ( 67 studies including 2,059 subjects ) met  the eligibility criteria and were included for further  analyses  . Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed according to the Cochrane H and book for Systematic Review s of Interventions . A meta- analysis of all r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) was performed to determine  the effect of EXT on asthma symptoms , BHR , EIB , FEV1 , exercise capacity and exercise endurance  compared  with control  training . In addition , relative pre/post changes were analysed in all RCTs and controlled trials . Finally , multiple linear regression models were used to identify effects of  relative changes in airway hyperreactivity ( BHR or EIB ) , lung function ( FEV1 or PEF ) and training hours on QoL and exercise performance  . Results In a  total of 17 studies including 599 subjects  , meta-analyses showed a significant  improvement in days without asthma symptoms , FEV1 and exercise capacity while BHR  only tended to improve . The analysis of relative within-group changes after EXT showed , however , significant improvements in  QoL ( 17 % ) , BHR ( 53 % ) , EIB ( 9 % ) , and FEV1  ( 3 % ) compared with control conditions . Multiple linear regression models revealed that changes in airway hyperreactivity and lung function significantly contributed to the change in  QoL  , while mainly the changes in airway hyperreactivity contributed to the change in exercise capacity . Conclusion EXT was shown to improve  asthma symptoms , QoL , exercise capacity , BHR , EIB , and FEV1   in asthmatics  and  improvements  in  BHR  explained part of the improvement in  QoL  and  exercise capacity .  Thus ,  physical activity  should be recommended as a supplementary therapy to medication . However , more well controlled studies should be performed assessing the relationship of  physical activity  ,  QoL  ,  airway hyperreactivity  ,  lung function  and especially  airway inflammation  as well as medication intake."
" There are insufficient r and omised controlled trial data evaluating the effects of  screening for  GDM based on different risk profiles and setting s on maternal and infant outcomes . Low- quality evidence suggests  universal screening  compared with  risk factor-based screening  leads to more women being diagnosed with GDM . Low to very low- quality evidence suggests no clear differences between primary care and secondary care screening , for outcomes  : GDM , hypertension , pre-eclampsia , caesarean birth , large-for-gestational age , neonatal complications composite , and hypoglycaemia .  Further , high- quality r and omised controlled trials are needed to assess the value of  screening for  GDM , which may compare different protocol s , guidelines or programmes for screening ( based on different risk profiles and setting s ) , with the absence of screening , or with other protocol s , guidelines or programmes . There is a need for future trials to be sufficiently powered to detect important  differences  in  short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes  , such as those important outcomes pre-specified in this review . As only a proportion of women will be diagnosed with GDM in these trials , large sample sizes may be required."

RESULTS  Specificity  was appropriately applied by 84 % ,  progression  by 29 % ,  overload  by 38 % and  initial values  by 67 % of newly identified studies .  Reversibility  was reported by 3 % and diminishing returns by 22 % of newly identified studies . No studies reported all components of the  exercise  prescription in the methods , or adherence to the prescribed intervention in the results .  Reporting of reversibility  has increased from 2010 , but no other improvements in reporting were noted from the previous review . SUMMARY /  No studies of exercise in  women with breast cancer  attended to all principles of  exercise training  , or reported all components of  the  exercise prescription   in the methods , or adherence to the prescription in the results . Full reporting of the exercise prescribed and completed is essential for study replication in research and translating research findings into the community , and should be prioritised in future trials."
"yObjective To identify the effectiveness of  auricular acupressure ( AA )  in  patients with acute  postoperative  pain after surgery  by systematic review . Methods A search of r and omized controlled trials was conducted in  5 English medical electronic data bases and 4 Chinese data bases .  Two review ers independently retrieved related studies , assessed the method ological quality , and extracted data with a st and ardized data form . Meta-analyses were performed using all time-points meta- analysis . Results A  total of 26 studies with 1,682 participants were included .  Results showed that compared with conventional therapy ,  AA  significantly improved  the total effective  rate [ risk ratio=1.25 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.13 to 1.37 , Plt;0.0001 ; heterogeneity : Plt;0.0001 , I2=85 % ] . In the subgroup analysis , the results changed in different follow-up time and surgery categories . The  pain relief  in the AA group might be the most significant at 72 h after surgery ( mean difference=–0.85 , 95 % CI,–1.20 to–0.50 , Plt;0.0001 ) and in abdominal surgery ( mean difference=–1.15 , 95 % CI,–1.41 to–0.90 , Plt;0.0001 ) . Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results of this meta- analysis were stable  . No serious adverse effects  were recorded . Conclusion It was recommended to  provide AA   to patients with acute  postoperative  pain .  However , a more accurate estimate of the effect requires further rigorously design ed large-scale and high- quality RCTs for improving acute postoperative pain after surgery."
"aBACKGROUND Globally , most  patients with hypertension  are treated with monotherapy , and control rates are poor because monotherapy only reduces blood pressure by around 9/5 mm Hg on average . There is a pressing need for blood pressure-control strategies with improved efficacy and tolerability . We aim ed to assess whether ultra-low-dose combination therapy could meet these needs . METHODS We did a r and omised , placebo-controlled , double-blind , crossover trial of a  quadpill-a single capsule containing four blood pressure-lowering drugs  each at quarter-dose  ( irbesartan 37·5 mg , amlodipine 1·25 mg , hydrochlorothiazide 6·25 mg , and atenolol 12·5 mg )  .  Participants with untreated hypertension were enrolled from four centres in the community of western Sydney , NSW , Australia , mainly by general practitioners .  Participants were r and omly allocated by computer to either the  quadpill or matching placebo  for 4 weeks ; this treatment was followed by a 2-week washout , then the other study treatment was administered for 4 weeks . Study staff and participants were unaware of treatment allocations , and masking was achieved by use of identical opaque capsules . The primary outcome  was placebo-corrected 24-h systolic ambulatory blood pressure reduction  after 4 weeks and analysis was by intention to treat . We also did a systematic review of trials evaluating the  efficacy  and safety of quarter-st and ard-dose blood pressure-lowering therapy against placebo . This trial is registered with the Australian New Zeal and Clinical Trials Registry , number ACTRN12614001057673 . The trial ended after 1 year and this report presents the final analysis .  FINDINGS Between November , 2014 , and December , 2015 , 55 patients were screened for our r and omised trial , of whom 21 underwent r and omisation . Mean age of participants was 58 years ( SD 11 )  and mean baseline office and 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels  were  154  (14)/90  ( 11 )  mm Hg and  140 (9)/87 ( 8)  mm Hg  , respectively . One individual declined participation after r and omisation and two patients dropped out for administrative reasons .  The placebo-corrected reduction in systolic 24-h blood pressure  with the quadpill was 19 mm Hg ( 95 % CI  14 - 23 ) , and office blood  pressure was reduced by 22/13 mm Hg ( p<0·0001 ) . During quadpill treatment , 18 ( 100 % ) of 18  participants achieved office blood  pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg , compared  with  six ( 33 % ) of 18 during placebo treatment ( p=0·0013  )  . There were  no serious adverse events  and all patients reported that the quadpill was easy to swallow . Our systematic review identified  36 trials ( n=4721 participants )  of one drug at quarter-dose and  six trials ( n=312 )  of two drugs at quarter-dose , against placebo .  The pooled placebo-corrected blood pressure-lowering effects  were 5/2 mm Hg and 7/5 mm Hg , respectively ( both p<0·0001 ) , and there were  no  side-effects from either regimen . INTERPRETATION The findings of our small trial in the context of previous r and omised evidence suggest that the benefits of quarter-dose therapy could be additive across classes and might confer a clinical ly important  reduction in blood pressure  . Further examination of the quadpill concept is needed to investigate effectiveness against usual treatment options and longer term tolerability .

" Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less  effective  than longer or higher-dose regimens , or indeed that the latter are associated with more  adverse events .  Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger , well- design ed trials . Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform . Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients."
" : The current evidence suggests surgery is superior  to stereotactic body radiation therapy  in terms of mid‐ and long‐term clinical outcomes  ; stereotactic body radiation therapy  is associated with  lower perioperative  mortality . However , the improved outcomes after surgery may be due at least in part to an imbalance of baseline characteristics . Future studies should aim to provide histopathologic confirmation of malignancy and  compare stereotactic body radiation therapy  with minimally invasive anatomical resections."
"sDecades of research have suggested that  expressive writing  produces  physical and psychological benefits  in controlled laboratory experiments among  healthy college students .  This work has been extended to clinical and  medical population s , including cancer patients .  Although  expressive writing  could be a promising and inexpensive intervention for this population , the effects have not been systematic ally examined in oncology sample s. A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines was conducted for experimental trials of  cancer patients who participated in an  expressive writing intervention .   PsycINFO and PubMed / Medline were search ed for peer- review ed studies .  Thirteen articles met the inclusion /exclusion criteria .  Although the majority of the intervention effects were null , there were several main effects for  expressive writing  on  sleep , pain , and general physical and psychological symptoms .  Several moderators were identified , suggesting that  expressive writing  may be more or less beneficial based on individual characteristics such as social constraints . The review ed studies were limited due to representativeness of the sample s , performance , detection and patient-reported outcomes biases , and heterogeneity of the intervention protocol and writing prompts . Future studies with rigorous design s are needed to determine whether  expressive writing  is therapeutically effective in cancer patients."

"lThe use of the highly effective  Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) conjugate vaccine  has increased globally . We review the benefits and limitations of studies measuring   Hib vaccine  effectiveness ( VE ) .  We critically examine the case-control approach by assessing the similarities and differences in methodology and findings and discuss the need for future Hib VE studies . In the absence of good surveillance data , vaccine effectiveness studies can play an important role , particularly with the increasing use of  pneumococcal vaccine  that has not been well tested under field conditions in less developed countries . However , the  effectiveness of  Hib vaccine   has been well documented so the need for future VE Hib studies is minimal."

"yOBJECTIVES A systematic review /meta- analysis was conducted to assess the  effectiveness and safety  of second-line treatments for  advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC )  , which includes the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor  axitinib .  METHODS Data base search es were conducted to identify r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Indirect comparisons using a fixed-effect Bayesian model were used to assess the  relative effectiveness of treatments  and reported as  hazard ratio ( HR ) and 95 % credible intervals ( CrI )  . RESULTS Although  24 RCTs met eligibility criteria , only three studies were  included in the fixed-effect Bayesian meta- analysis , due to differences in patient inclusion criteria /reported outcomes in the wider data set . Robust meta- analysis was restricted to the  subgroup pretreated with cytokines .  In terms of  progression-free survival ( PFS )  , axitinib was superior compared with placebo ( HR = 0.25 , 95 % CrI : 0.17 - 0.38 ) , sorafenib ( HR = 0.46 , 95 % CrI : 0.32 - 0.68 ) and  pazopanib  ( HR = 0.47 , 95 % CrI : 0.26 - 0.85 ) . An analysis including all  patients  ,  regardless  of  previous first-line treatment  , reported similar results . There was no significant  difference in PFS  between sorafenib and pazopanib .  Results from the present study suggest that axitinib will be an important treatment option to extend PFS in the management of  advanced RCC  in the second-line setting . Ongoing research will define the optimal treatment algorithm leading to a patient-focused treatment strategy."
"sOBJECTIVE  Caregivers of cancer patients  face intense dem and s throughout the course of the disease , survivorship , and bereavement .  Caregiver burden , needs , satisfaction , quality of life  , and other significant areas of caregiving are not monitored regularly in the clinic setting , result ing in a need to address the availability and clinical effectiveness of cancer caregiver distress tools . This review aim ed to determine the availability of  cancer caregiver instruments  , the variation of instruments between different domains of distress , and that between  adult and pediatric cancer patient population s.  METHOD A literature search was conducted using  various data bases from 1937 to 2013 .  Original articles on instruments were extracted separately if not included in the original literature search . The instruments were divided into different areas of caregiver distress and into adult versus pediatric population s.  Psychometric data  were also evaluated . RESULTS A  total of 5,541 articles were review ed  , and 135 articles ( 2.4 % ) were accepted based on our inclusion criteria . Some 59 instruments were identified , which fell into the following categories :  burden  ( n = 26 , 44 % ) ;  satisfaction with healthcare delivery  ( n = 5 , 8.5 % ) ;  needs  ( n = 14 , 23.7 % ) ;  quality of life  ( n = 9 , 15.3 % ) ; and other issues ( n = 5 , 8.5 % ) . The  median number of items  was 29 ( 4 - 125 ) : 20/59 instruments ( 33.9 % ) had ≤20 items ; 13 ( 22 % ) had ≤20 items and were psychometrically sound , with 12 of these 13 ( 92.3 % ) being self-report question naires . There were 44 instruments ( 74.6 % ) that measured  caregiver distress  for  adult cancer patients  and 15 ( 25.4 % ) for  caregivers of pediatric patients .  SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS There is a significant number of cancer caregiver instruments that are self-reported , concise , and psychometrically sound , which makes them attractive for further research into their clinical use , outcomes , and effectiveness."
"tThe purpose of this systematic review was to summarize and qualitatively analyze published evidence elucidating the prevalence of dysphagia and detail alterations in swallowing function in  patients with OSAS .   Computerized literature search  es were performed from four search engines . The studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria . The studies were screened using Covidence ( Cochrane tool ) and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses statement st and ards ( PRISMA -2009 ) .  A total 2645 studies were initially retrieved  , of  which a total of 17 studies met inclusion criteria .  Two review ers , blinded to each other , evaluated level and strength of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence -based Medicine Levels of Evidence and QualSyst , respectively .  Dysphagia prevalence  ranged from 16 to 78 % among the eligible studies . Studies varied in operational definitions defining  swallowing dysfunction ( dysphagia )  and method used to  assess swallowing function .  Approximately 70 % of eligible studies demonstrated strong method  ological  quality . The majority of studies ( n = 11 ; 65 % ) reported  pharyngeal swallowing impairments  in  patients with OSAS  , including  delayed initiation of pharyngeal swallow and penetration/aspiration .  This systematic review describes  swallowing function  in  patients with OSAS .  However , due to the variability in defining OSAS and dysphagia , in the assessment method used to determine dysphagia , and heterogeneity of study design s , true prevalence is difficult to determine . Clinicians involved in the management of  OSAS patients  should employ vali date d assessment measures to determine if swallow dysfunction is present."

"2Background The role of  platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  in  triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patients  is highly controversial and it is not endorsed by current guidelines . Our meta- analysis aim ed to better eluci date its activity , efficacy and safety . Material and methods A systematic search of Medline , Web of Science and conferences proceedings up to 30 October 2017 was carried out to identify r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating  platinum-based versus platinum-free neoadjuvant chemotherapy  in  TNBC patients .  Using the fixed and r and om effects models , pooled odds ratios ( ORs ) and hazard ratios ( HRs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were calculated for  pathological complete response ( pCR  , defined as  ypT0/is pN0 ) , event-free survival ( EFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) and grade 3 and 4 adverse events ( AEs : neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia and neuropathy )  . Results  Nine RCTs ( N = 2109 ) were included .  Overall ,  platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  significantly  increased pCR rate  from 37.0 % to 52.1 % ( OR 1.96 , 95 % CI 1.46 - 2.62 , P < 0.001 ) .  Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  remained significantly associated with  increased pCR rate  also after restricting the analysis to the three RCTs ( N = 611 ) that used the same st and ard regimen in both groups of weekly  paclitaxel ( with or without carboplatin )  followed by  anthracycline and cyclophosphamide  ( OR 2.53 , 95 % CI 1.37 - 4.66 , P = 0.003 ) . Conversely , among the  96 BRCA-mutated patients included in two RCTs  , the addition of carboplatin was not associated with significantly  increased pCR rate  ( OR 1.17 , 95 % CI 0.51 - 2.67 , P = 0.711 ) . Two RCTs ( N = 748 ) reported  survival outcomes :  no significant difference  in EFS  ( HR 0.72 , 95 % CI 0.49 - 1.06 , P = 0.094 )  and OS  ( HR 0.86 , 95 % CI 0.46 - 1.63 , P = 0.651 ) was observed . A significant higher risk of  grade 3 and 4 hematological AEs  , with no increased risk of  grade 3 and 4 neuropathy  was observed with  platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy .  Conclusion In  TNBC patients  ,  platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  is associated with significantly  increased pCR rates  at the cost of worse  hematological  toxicities .  Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy  may be considered an option in  TNBC patients .  PROSPERO registration number CRD42018080042."
"tThe  INtubation-SURfactant-Extubation ( INSURE ) procedure  is a widely-used surfactant administration method to treat  preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS )  but is not always successful . We conducted a systematic review to identify early predictive factors for failure of this procedure . A systematic literature search was performed until July 2018 in MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . Original studies comparing INSURE success with INSURE failure in  preterm infants with RDS  were included . A predefined data extraction form was used to retrieve data from articles , and method ological quality was assessed using the SIGN checklists .  Fifteen studies out of 690 identified records met inclusion criteria .  Method ological quality varied , only 8 studies performed multivariate analysis . We identified 20 different risk factors in total . Evidence for  birth weight ( BW )  as a predictor for INSURE failure was inconsistent , but there was a significant association between  decreasing gestational age ( GA ) and failure risk . RDS severity  was assessed in multiple ways , using  arterial blood gas values , imaging , and scoring systems .  In conclusion ,  extremely low BW , low GA , and severe RDS  appear to be risk factors for INSURE failure . However , evidence is inconsistent due to important method ological heterogeneity . Therefore , clinical applicability of these results is limited and implies the need for future large cohort studies on this subject."
"sSelf-report is often used to estimate health care utilization . However , the accuracy of such data is of paramount concern . The authors conducted a systematic review of 42 studies that evaluated the accuracy of    self-report utilization data    , where utilization was defined as a visit to a clinical provider or entity . They also present a broad conceptual model that identifies major issues to consider when collecting , analyzing , and reporting such data . The results show that   self-report  data  are of variable  accuracy  . Factors that affect accuracy include ( 1 )  sample population  and cognitive abilities , ( 2 ) recall time frame , ( 3 ) type of utilization , ( 4 ) utilization frequency , ( 5 ) question naire design , ( 6 ) mode of data collection , and ( 7 ) memory aids and probes."
"tObstructive  sleep apnea ( OSA )  is associated with   excessive daytime sleepiness   , decreased  quality of life , myocardial infa rct ion  ( 1 , 2 ) ,  heart failure  ( 3 ) ,  stroke  ( 4 , 5 ) , and  cognitive decline  ( 6 , 7 ) .  Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP )  improves  quality of life  and  symptoms  among  persons with OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness  ( 8) . Although  CPAP  has not been shown in r and omized trials to reduce  myocardial infa rct ions , stroke ,  or  death  ( 912 ) among  patients with OSA  , it decreases  blood pressure  and is associated with reduced risk for  motor vehicle accidents  ( 13 ) . As patients and providers gain awareness of OSA , and as prevalence of obesity ( a major risk factor for OSA ) increases ( 14 ) , health care systems need to develop strategies to address the increasing dem and for sleep services . The traditional evaluation and care model relies on primary care providers to refer  patients with suspected OSA   to a  sleep  specialist physician ( SSP ) .  The process often includes  consultation , in-laboratory diagnostic polysomnography ( PSG ) , CPAP initiation and titration PSG  for persons with OSA , and SSP follow-up of treatment adherence and efficacy . This traditional model may be expensive and inefficient . New OSA care models have been proposed and implemented , including  home sleep testing for diagnostic purpose s (  15  ,  16  )  ,  followed by treatment with an autotitrating CPAP device  ( 17 ) , which has  internal  algorithms that adjust  pressure  to  keep the airway open during sleep  . These models reduce  PSG-associated costs  and  logistical barriers  but typically still include  SSP consultation and follow-up .  Given recent data indicating a decreasing supply of SSPs ( 18 ) , other models have been proposed that would reduce reliance on SSPs by including providers not specifically trained as SSPs ( nonsleep specialists [ NSSs ] ) , such as nurses or primary care physicians , to provide the majority of OSA diagnosis and treatment . Although studies testing some of these new models have been conducted , systematic review s of studies focusing on who should deliver care are lacking . In this article , we exp and on 1 aspect of a larger evidence report conducted for the Department of Veterans Affairs Evidence -based Synthesis Program ( protocol registered in PROSPERO [ CRD42016036810 ] ) ( 19 ) by assessing the comparative effectiveness and harms of new  OSA  evaluation and  treatment  models comparing different provider types . Specifically , we evaluated case finding and care by NSSs versus SSPs for  patients with suspected or diagnosed OSA .  Methods Data Sources and Search es We search ed Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL for articles  published from January 2000 through July 2017  . Our search was limited to  studies that enrolled adults and were published in English .  The search for studies of NSSs versus SSPs included the Medical Subject Headings terms sleep apnea syndromes ; sleep apnea , obstructive ; and health personnel ( Appendix Table 1 ) . We obtained additional articles by h and - search ing reference lists of relevant studies . Appendix Table 1 . Search Strategies Study Selection Abstract s and full-text reports were independently review ed by 2 trained investigators and research associates . Full-text reports of studies identified as potentially eligible after abstract review were obtained for further review . We included r and omized or controlled clinical trials and observational studies that reported results in  adults with suspected or diagnosed OSA and were conducted in geographic setting s likely to have similar population s and sleep medicine re sources ( United States , Canada , Europe , Australia , and New Zeal and ) .  We adopted a broad definition of care models but required that the study include a comparison of providers with different qualifications ( for example , primary care physician vs. SSP ) . We did not include studies that compared  home sleep testing  with  sleep laboratory testing  if all test results were interpreted by SSPs . We excluded studies evaluating the role of dentists or anesthesiologists and studies in which the goal of the intervention was not OSA care . We also excluded  studies  if  they did not report our outcomes of interest  or  were dissertations , conference abstract  s , case reports ,  narrative  review s , editorials , or commentaries . Reasons for exclusion of a study at full-text review were noted , and disagreements were resolved by a third review er . Data Abstract ion and Quality Assessment Study characteristics and outcomes were extracted by one investigator and verified by a second . Our outcomes of interest included  patient-centered outcomes ( mortality , access to care , quality of life , patient satisfaction , adherence , symptom scores , and adverse events )  and  intermediate or re source -related outcomes ( re source use , costs , time to initiation of treatment , and case finding )  . Two trained investigators rated the risk of bias of individual studies over all outcomes as low , medium , or high . For r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , we based risk-of-bias ratings on the following criteria : allocation sequence generation , allocation concealment , blinding , incomplete outcome data , and selective outcome reporting ( 20 ) . For observational studies , we rated risk of bias using criteria from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Methods Guide ( 21 ) . We assessed strength of evidence as high , moderate , low , or insufficient , based on the following domains : study limitations ( low , moderate , or high , based on the quality or risk of bias of individual studies ) , consistency ( consistent , inconsistent , or unknown or not applicable ) ,  directness  ( direct or indirect ) , and precision ( precise or imprecise ) ( 22 ) . Strength of evidence was rated by one method ologist and verified by a second . Discrepancies were resolved by discussion . Data Synthesis and Analysis We described and qualitatively compared findings of included studies . Analyses were performed in Comprehensive Meta- Analysis , version 3 ( Biostat ) , using r and om-effects models to calculate mean differences with corresponding 95 % CIs . Role of the Funding Source The Department of Veterans Affairs , Veterans Health Administration , Office of Research and Development , Quality Enhancement Research Initiative assigned the topic and review ed the original protocol but was not involved in data collection , analysis , or manuscript preparation or su bmi ssion . Results Search results are shown in Figure 1 . Our search identified  12 studies that were eligible for inclusion .  Figure 1 . Evidence search and selection . *  An additional 23 studies on autotitrating positive airway pressure vs. continuous positive airway pressure  were included in the full evidence report only . Case Finding  in Adults With Suspected OSA  We identified  4 observational studies on case finding in adults with suspected OSA ( 2326 ) .  Study characteristics are summarized in Appendix Table 2 , with additional information provided in Supplement Table 1 . Two studies received government funding , 1 received both government and respiratory society funding , and 1 did not report a funding source . Each study took a different approach to case finding . Two were rated as having high risk of bias ( 23 , 25 ) , and 2 were rated as having medium risk of bias ( 24 , 26 ) . Although population s , interventions , comparators , and setting s differed across studies , outcomes were similar and results suggested  good agreement between SSPs and NSSs  ( Supplement Tables 2 and 3 ) . Supplement . Supplementary Material Appendix Table 2 . Summary of Study Characteristics In a single-site study in the  United States  , a nurse practitioner experienced in sleep medicine and supervised by an SSP review ed electronic health records of  patients  referred for evaluation of OSA ( 23 ) . The goal was risk stratification and determination of eligibility for an unattended sleep study . If information from the health records was inadequate , a clinic visit with an SSP was scheduled . The health record review ( nurse practitioner evaluation ) found  adequate information for 115 patients , whereas 90 had a clinic visit ( SSP evaluation  ) . A  community-based study in the United States included 191 patients with at least 4 hours of interpretable recording time from a  portable sleep monitoring device  (  24  ) .  The classification of disease severity that was based on the ApneaHypopnea Index value generated by the monitoring device software was compared with the classification that was based on an independent review of the monitoring device output by a board-certified SSP . In the third  study , conducted in Spain , 88 patients with suspected OSA were evaluated by 2  providers : a  respiratory physician who was trained in sleep medicine and used results from respiratory polygraphy , and an SSP who used results from PSG  ( 26 ) . Both evaluations took place within 1 month . Each of these studies reported on classification of  OSA severity  ( none to severe ) . Two reported coefficients of 0.75 ( 24 ) and 0.71 ( 26 ) , indicating good agreement . The third study only reported that the final  diagnoses of severity  did not statistically significantly differ between groups ( 23 ) . We found low-strength evidence that  classification of OSA severity  was similar ( Table 1 ) . One of the studies also reported agreement on the  ApneaHypopnea Index  ( < 10 , 10 to 29 , or 30 events per hour ) , with a coefficient of 0.65 ( 26 ) . Table 1 . Strength of Evidence The fourth study , also done in Spain , compared the ability of a primary care pulmonologist ( described as having basic knowledge of sleep medicine ) and an  SSP  to identify the  most suitable diagnostic test  for individual patients ( 25  ) . Ninety-six patients were included .  A coefficient of 0.74 was reported for agreement on the diagnostic test prescribed . No studies assessed  patient satisfaction  with care , but 1 study evaluated  patient-reported clinical improvement  ( 23 ) . The percentage who perceived  clinical improvement  at 30-day follow-up was similar ( P= 0.76 ) among patients who were evaluated by chart review and those who required a clinic visit . Many of our other outcomes of interest were not."
"eBACKGROUND  Treat to target ( TTT )  is a broad concept for treating  patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) .  It involves setting a treatment target , usually remission or low disease activity ( LDA ) . This is often combined with frequent patient assessment and intensive and rapidly adjusted drug treatment , sometimes based on a formal protocol . OBJECTIVE To investigate the  clinical effectiveness  and  cost-effectiveness  of  TTT  compared with  routine care .  DATA SOURCES Data bases including EMBASE and MEDLINE were search ed from 2008 to August  2016  . REVIEW METHODS A systematic review of clinical effectiveness was conducted . Studies were grouped according to comparisons made : ( 1 )  TTT  compared with  usual care  , ( 2 ) different targets and ( 3 ) different treatment protocol s. Trials were subgrouped by  early or established disease population s.  Study heterogeneity precluded meta-analyses . Narrative synthesis was undertaken for the first two comparisons , but was not feasible for the third . A systematic review of  cost-effectiveness  was also undertaken . No model was constructed as a result of the heterogeneity among studies identified in the clinical effectiveness review . Instead , conclusions were drawn on the  cost-effectiveness  of   TTT   from papers relating to these studies . RESULTS  Sixteen clinical effectiveness studies were  included . They differed in terms of treatment target , treatment protocol ( where one existed ) and  patient visit frequency .  For several outcomes , mixed results or evidence of no difference between  TTT  and conventional care was found . In early disease , two studies found that TTT result ed in  favourable remission rates  , although the findings of one study were not statistically significant . In established disease , two studies showed that  TTT  may be  beneficial  in terms of LDA at 6 months , although , again , in one case the finding was not statistically significant . The TICORA (  TIght COntrol  for  RA )  trial found evidence of  lower remission rates  for  TTT  in a  mixed population  . Two studies reported  cost-effectiveness :  in one ,  TTT  dominated usual care ; in the other ,  step-up combination treatments  were shown to be  cost-effective .  In 5 of the 16 studies included the clinical effectiveness review , no  cost-effectiveness  conclusion could be reached , and in one study no conclusion could be drawn in the case of  patients denoted low risk  . In the remaining 10 studies , and among patients denoted high risk in one study ,  cost-effectiveness  was inferred . In most cases  TTT  is likely to be  cost-effective  , except where biological treatment in early disease is used initially . No conclusions could be drawn for established disease . LIMITATIONS  TTT  refers not to a single concept , but to a range of broad approaches . Evidence reflects this . Studies exhibit substantial heterogeneity , which hinders evidence synthesis . Many included studies are at risk of bias . FUTURE WORK Future studies comparing  TTT  with  usual care  must link to existing evidence . A consistent definition of  remission  in studies is required . There may be value in studies to establish the importance of different elements of TTT ( the setting of a target , the intensive use of drug treatments and protocol s pertaining to those drugs and the frequent assessment of patients ) .  In  early RA  and studies of mixed  early and established RA population s  , evidence suggests that TTT improves  remission rates .  In established disease , TTT may lead to improved  rates of LDA .  It remains unclear which element(s ) of TTT ( the target , treatment protocol s or increased frequency of patient visits ) drive these outcomes . Future trials comparing  TTT  with  usual care  and /or different  TTT  targets should use outcomes comparable with existing literature . Remission , defined in a consistent manner , should be the target of choice of future studies . STUDY REGISTRATION This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015017336 .

"sBACKGROUND Numerous studies investigating the efficacy of  TNF-alpha antagonists  in  moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis  have been published . We present a graphic synthesis of efficacy data based on a systematic review of the published studies . METHODS The Medline , Embase and Cochrane Library bibliographic data bases were search ed for studies based on the following selection criteria : 1 . Original studies , 2 . Using  infliximab , etanercept or adalimumab  as the sole systemic treatment for plaque-type cutaneous psoriasis , 3 . Minimum follow-up of 10 weeks , 4 . Use of the  PASI75 index  ( improvement of at least 75 % from baseline PASI  score  ) as an endpoint .  Twenty-one articles were selected  and  PASI75 scores  and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals were calculated at three , six and 12 months . RESULTS At M3 ,  success rates  were about 80 % with  infliximab  and  adalimumab  once-weekly , around 50 % with  etanercept  50 mg twice-weekly and  adalimumab  fortnightly ; and 30 % with  etanercept  25 mg twice-weekly . Maintenance regimens after three months ensured  success rates  above 50 % with all three treatments , although the long-term results were based on fewer studies .  Our graphic synthesis and tolerance data for the three drugs should guide clinicians in their therapeutic choices in  moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis .  Additional studies with better reporting of loss to follow-up are needed to better assess the long-term efficacy of these drugs."
" This review does not support the use of  prophylactic thyroid hormones  in  preterm infants  to reduce  neonatal mortality , neonatal morbidity or improve neurodevelopmental outcomes .  An adequately powered clinical trial of  thyroid hormone supplementation  with the goal of preventing the postnatal nadir of thyroid hormone levels seen in very preterm infants is required."
" Previous trials have shown that conjugate pneumococcal  vaccines  are  safe and effective  in normal healthy patients , even those under the age of two years . The controlled trials included in this review have demonstrated  immunogenicity  ( the body 's response , without which there is no protection ) of these vaccines , and observational studies in  people  with sickle cell disease support these findings . We therefore recommend that  conjugate pneumococcal vaccines  are used in  people with sickle cell disease .  R and omised trials in  patients with sickle  cell  disease  will be needed to determine the optimal vaccination regimen when further , potentially more effective vaccines become available . Such trials should measure clinical outcomes of effectiveness."
"dThe purpose of the current study was to conduct a 10-year systematic review of   HIV/AIDS mass communication campaigns  focused on sexual behavior , HIV testing , or both ( 1998–2007 )  and to compare the results with the last comprehensive review of such campaigns , conducted by Myhre and Flora ( 2000 ) . A comprehensive search strategy yielded  38 HIV/AIDS campaign evaluation articles published in peer- review ed journals , representing 34 distinct campaign efforts conducted in 23 countries .  The articles were coded on a variety of campaign design and evaluation dimensions by two independent coders . Results indicated that compared with the previous systematic review ( 1986–1998 period ) , campaigns increasingly have employed the following strategies : ( 1 ) targeted defined audiences developed through audience segmentation procedures ; ( 2 ) design ed campaign themes around behavior change ( rather than knowledge change ) ; ( 3 ) used behavioral theories ; ( 4 ) achieved high message exposure ; ( 5 ) used stronger research design s for outcome evaluation ; and ( 6 ) included measures of behavior ( or behavioral intentions ) in outcome assessment s. In addition , an examination of  10 campaign efforts  that used more rigorous quasi-experimental design s revealed that the majority ( 8 of 10 ) demonstrated  effects on behavior change or behavioral intentions .  Despite these positive developments , most HIV/AIDS campaigns continue to use weak ( i.e. , preexperimental ) outcome evaluation design s. Implication s of these results for improved design , implementation , and evaluation of HIV/AIDS campaign efforts are discussed."
" There is limited evidence to suggest that  MP in combination with other rehabilitation treatment  appears to be beneficial in  improving upper extremity function  after stroke , as compared with other  rehabilitation treatment without MP .  Evidence regarding  improvement in motor recovery and quality of movement  is less clear . There is no clear pattern regarding the ideal dosage of MP required to improve outcomes . Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of MP on time post stroke , volume of MP that is required to affect the outcomes and whether improvement is maintained long-term . Numerous large ongoing studies will soon improve the evidence base."
" Our systematic review has highlighted a pattern of growth in the number of studies evaluating  technology-based alcohol  interventions in primary care . Although these interventions appear to be largely beneficial in primary care , outcomes may be enhanced by provider involvement and implementation strategy use . This review enables better underst and ing of the typologies and efficacy of these interventions and informs recommendations for those developing and implementing technology-based alcohol interventions in primary care setting."

" A limited number of small studies have shown that  nedocromil  is of benefit in improving  lung function  and  some measures of symptoms  , but the evidence with regard to the primary outcome of the review was conflicting . Two long-term trials did not show consistent effects on  lung function  outcomes , whereas several small short-term trials have shown benefit in these outcomes . Differing severities at baseline may explain this difference with milder participants experiencing less benefit , although the discrepancy between study findings may also reflect publication bias .  Nedocromil sodium  is associated with a very good  safety profile  with no significant  short term or long- term adverse side effects .  Although  nedocromil  may have advantages over inhaled corticosteroids in terms of  side effects  , there is a need for head to head trials of  nedocromil  and inhaled corticosteroids to establish whether  asthma control  is similar , especially in mild asthma . It is not yet clear where  nedocromil  should sit in relation to other therapies in the treatment of asthma in children."
" There is some limited evidence suggesting that oral appliance improves  subjective sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing  compared with a control .  Nasal continuous positive airways pressure  appears to be more  effective  in improving  sleep disordered breathing  than oral appliance . Until there is more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of  oral appliances  , it would appear to be appropriate to restrict  oral appliance therapy  to patients with sleep apnoea who are unwilling or unable to comply with continuous positive airways pressure therapy."
"dPediatric  obesity  treatment programs report high attrition rates , but it is unknown if family experience and satisfaction contributes . This review surveys the literature regarding satisfaction in  pediatric obesity  and questions used in measurement . A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline , PsychINFO , and CINAHL . Studies of  satisfaction  in pediatric weight management were review ed , and related studies of obesity were included .   Satisfaction survey  questions  were obtained from the articles or from the authors .  Eighteen studies were included ; 14 quantitative and 4 qualitative .  Only one study linked  satisfaction  to  attrition  , and none investigated the association of  satisfaction  and  weight outcomes .  Most investigations included  satisfaction  as a secondary aim or used single-item questions of  overall satisfaction ;  only one assessed  satisfaction  in noncompleters . Overall ,  participants  expressed high levels of  satisfaction  with  obesity  treatment or prevention programs . Surveys focused predominantly on  overall satisfaction  or specific components of the program . Few in-depth studies of  satisfaction  with pediatric obesity treatment have been conducted . Increased focus on  family satisfaction  with  obesity  treatment may provide an avenue to lower  attrition rates  and improve  outcomes .  Enhancing measurement of satisfaction to yield actionable responses could positively influence outcomes , and a framework , via patient-centered care principles , is provided."

"eStudy design : Systematic review . Objectives : To provide a quantitative analysis of all r and omized controlled trials design ed to determine the effectiveness of  physical interventions  for  people with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) .  Setting :  Sydney , Australia .  Methods : A search was conducted for r and omized controlled trials involving   physical interventions   for  people with SCI .  Two review ers independently rated method ological quality using the PEDro scale and extracted key findings from the trials . Results :  Four thous and five hundred and forty three abstract s were identified  of  which 31 trials met the inclusion criteria  . Trials examined the effectiveness  of  fitness and strength training   ( n=7 ) ,   gait training   ( n=5 ) ,   h and therapy   ( n=3 ) ,   stretch   ( n=4 ) ,   acupuncture   ( n=3 ) ,   h and splinting   ( n=2 ) and   other related therapies   ( n=7 ) . Six trials reported a  between-group mean difference  with a clearly important treatment effect on at least one outcome measure . These trials supported the use of  fitness , strength and gait  training as well as acupuncture . Conclusion : There is initial evidence supporting the effectiveness of some  physical interventions  for people with SCI . However , there is a pressing need for high- quality trials to determine the effectiveness of all physical interventions commonly administered in clinical practice."

"sThe current epidemic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is reshaping the field of hepatology all around the world . The widespread diffusion of metabolic risk factors such as obesity , type2-diabetes mellitus , and dyslipidemia has led to a worldwide diffusion of NAFLD . In parallel to the increased availability of effective anti-viral agents , NAFLD is rapidly becoming the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western Countries , and a similar trend is expected in Eastern Countries in the next years . This epidemic and its consequences have prompted experts from all over the word in identifying effective strategies for the diagnosis , management , and treatment of  NAFLD  . Different scientific societies from Europe , America , and Asia-Pacific regions have proposed guidelines based on the most recent evidence about NAFLD . These guidelines are consistent with the key elements in the management of  NAFLD  , but still , show significant difference about some critical points . We review ed the current literature in English language to identify the most recent scientific guidelines about NAFLD with the aim to find and critically analyse the main differences . We distinguished guidelines from 5 different scientific societies whose reputation is worldwide recognised and who are representative of the clinical practice in different geographical regions . Differences were noted in : the definition of  NAFLD  , the opportunity of NAFLD screening in high-risk patients , the non-invasive test proposed for the  diagnosis of NAFLD  and the identification  of  NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis   , in the follow-up protocol s and , finally , in the treatment strategy ( especially in the proposed  pharmacological management  ) . These difference have been discussed in the light of the possible evolution of the scenario of NAFLD in the next years."
" Little r and omised evidence is available evaluating the use of  oral anti-diabetic agents  in  women with diabetes mellitus , impaired glucose tolerance , previous gestational diabetes mellitus planning a pregnancy or pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus .  Large trials comparing any combination of  oral anti-diabetic agent , insulin and dietary and lifestyle advice  in these women , reporting on  maternal and infant health outcomes , glycaemic control , women 's views on the intervention and long-term health outcomes for mother and child  , are required to guide clinical practice."
 The ideal intraoperative ventilation strategy in  obese patients  remains obscure . There is some evidence that RM added to PEEP compared with PEEP alone  improves intraoperative oxygenation and compliance without adverse effects  . There is no evidence of any difference between PCV and VCV.
 Currently available data from RCTs are insufficient to confirm or refute whether pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation offers any advantage for  people with acute respiratory failure due to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome .  More studies including a larger number of people given  PCV  and  VCV  may provide reliable evidence on which more firm conclusions can be based.
"  Hib vaccine  is  safe and effective .  The size of the effect could plausibly be anywhere between a 46 % and 93 % reduction in Hib  invasive disease  , before the effect of herd immunity is taken into account . In re source -poor setting s , decisions to use the vaccine will depend on its cost , the local burden of Hib disease and competing priorities . Insufficient evidence from r and omised controlled trials was identified of the effects of  Hib conjugate vaccine  on either  Hib-specific or  on all-cause mortality."
"sBACKGROUND Allergic diseases have increased worldwide in the last 2 decades , with children suffering the highest burden of the condition . The  ω-3 long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA )  possesses anti-inflammatory properties that could lead to a reduction in inflammatory mediators in allergies . OBJECTIVE A systematic review and meta- analysis of the most recent follow-ups of r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of  ω-3 LCPUFA supplementation  started during pregnancy on  allergic outcomes in offspring .  METHODS  The RCTs with a minimum of 1-month follow-up post gestation  were eligible for inclusion . The CENTRAL , MEDLINE , SCOPUS , WHO 's International Clinical Trials Register , E-theses , and Web of Science data bases were search ed . Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration 's risk of bias tool . RESULTS  Ten RCTs ( 3,637 children ) , from 9 unique trials  , examined the effectiveness  of ω-3 LCPUFA supplementation  started during pregnancy on the  development  of   allergic outcomes  in offspring .  Heterogeneities were seen between the trials in terms of their sample , type , and duration of intervention and follow-up . Pooled estimates showed a significant reduction  in childhood "" sensitization to egg ""  ( relative risk [ RR ] = 0.54 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.32 - 0.90 ) , and  "" sensitization to peanut ""  ( RR = 0.62 , 95 % CI = 0.40 - 0.96 ) . No statistical differences were found for  other allergic outcomes ( eg  ,  eczema , asthma/wheeze )  .  These results suggest that  intake of ω-3 LCPUFA  started during pregnancy can reduce the  risk of  sensitization to egg and peanut ; however , the evidence is limited because of the small number of studies that contributed to the meta-analyses . The current evidence on the association between  supplementation with ω-3 LCPUFA  started during pregnancy and allergic outcomes is weak , because of the risk of bias and heterogeneities between studies."

"OBackground Thoracic surgical procedures impair respiratory function , decreasing ventilation and oxygenation and increasing the risk of  acute respiratory failure  and  pulmonary complications .  To prevent these clinical repercussions ,  positive airway pressure therapy  is widely used to increase  pulmonary ventilation  , decrease  muscle  overload , and ensure adequate oxygenation ; however , the benefit of this therapy remains unclear . Methods / design A systematic search of the literature including PubMed , CINAHL , AMED , PsycINFO , LILACS , Scielo , Scopus , PEDro , and the Cochrane Library will identify the  r and omized and quasi-r and omized trials  that used   CPAP , Bilevel , or IPPB compared  with a control without intervention , a sham treatment or other lung expansion  techniques  following  thoracic surgical procedures .   From these trials , we will extract data on a predefined list of outcomes , including  oxygenation , ventilation , respiratory failure , pulmonary complications , and time of resolution of the clinical condition .  The method ological  quality  of each trial included will be assessed using the PEDro scale . The strength of the recommendations will be summarized using the  GRADE  scale . Meta-analyses will be performed , if appropriate . Discussion This review aims to promote greater knowledge regarding the efficiency of the use of non-invasive positive airway pressure on  recovery of respiratory function  and on prevention of  pulmonary complications  following thoracic surgical procedures . This review could help health professionals improve the care for  patients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures .  Systematic review registration PROSPERO."
" We found no statistically significant differences in  fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events  in trials in which regular salmeterol was r and omly allocated with  ICS  , in comparison to  ICS  alone at the same dose .  Although 13,447 adults and 1862 children have now been included in trials  , the frequency of adverse events is too low and the results are too imprecise to confidently rule out a relative increase in  all cause mortality or non-fatal adverse events  with salmeterol used in conjunction with  ICS .  However , the absolute difference between groups in the  risk of serious adverse events  was very small . We could not determine whether the increase in  all cause non-fatal serious adverse events  reported in the previous meta- analysis on regular salmeterol alone is abolished by the additional use of regular  ICS .  We await the results of large ongoing surveillance studies m and ated by the FDA to provide more information . There were no asthma-related  deaths  and few asthma-related  serious adverse events .  Clinical decisions and information for patients regarding regular use of salmeterol have to take into account the balance between known symptomatic benefits of salmeterol and the degree of uncertainty and concern associated with its potential harmful effects."
"eIntroduction  Nosocomial  pneumonia is the most important infectious complication in  patients admitted to intensive care units .   Kinetic bed therapy  may reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in  mechanically ventilated patients .  The objective of this study was to investigate whether  kinetic bed therapy  reduces the incidence of  nosocomial  pneumonia and improves outcomes in  critically ill mechanically ventilated patients .  Methods We search ed Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , CENTRAL , and AMED for studies , as well as review ed abstract s of conference proceedings , bibliographies of included studies and review articles and contacted the manufacturers of medical beds . Studies included were  r and omized or pseudo-r and omized  clinical trials of  kinetic bed therapy  compared to  st and ard manual turning  in  critically ill mechanically ventilated adult patients .  Two review ers independently applied the study selection criteria and extracted data regarding study validity , type of bed used , intensity of kinetic therapy , and population under investigation . Outcomes assessed included the  incidence of nosocomial pneumonia , mortality , duration of ventilation , and intensive care unit and hospital length of stay .  Results Fifteen prospect i ve clinical trials were identified ,  which included a total of 1,169 participants .  No trial met all the validity criteria . There was a significant reduction in the  incidence of nosocomial pneumonia  ( pooled odds ratio ( OR ) 0.38 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.28 to 0.53 ) , but no reduction in  mortality  ( pooled OR 0.96 , 95%CI 0.66 to1.14 ) ,  duration of mechanical ventilation  ( pooled st and ardized mean difference ( SMD ) -0.14 days , 95%CI , -0.29 to 0.02 ) ,  duration of intensive care unit stay  ( pooled SMD -0.064 days , 95 % CI , -0.21 to 0.086 ) or  duration of hospital stay  ( pooled SMD 0.05 days , 95 % CI -0.18 to 0.27 ) . Conclusion While  kinetic bed therapy  has been purported to reduce the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients , the overall body of evidence is insufficient to support this conclusion . There appears to be a reduction in the  incidence  of  nosocomial pneumonia  , but no effect on  mortality , duration of mechanical ventilation , or intensive care or hospital length of stay .  Given the lack of consistent benefit and the poor method ological quality of the trials included in this analysis , definitive recommendations regarding the use of this therapy can not be made at this time."
"AThe purpose of this review is to conduct a systematic review and meta- analysis comparing the effects of  continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) with  a m and  ibular advancement device  ( MAD ) in improving the  quality of life ( sleepiness , cognitive , and functional outcomes )  in  patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) .  Authors identified r  and omized  ,   placebo-controlled   studies from MEDLINE through PubMed , Web of Science , and the Cochrane Library . Studies were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria , as well as risk of bias . Initial search yielded  240 unduplicated references  , which the authors reduced to 12 relevant studies .  Patients with  CPAP therapy   showed no statistically significant difference in the  post-treatment quality of life  measured with the  SF-36 mental health component  ( p = .994 ) , or the  SF-36 physical functioning component  ( p = .827 ) . There was no significant improvement in  neither Functional Outcomes of Sleep Question naire  ( p = .788 )  nor cognitive performance  ( p = .395 ) compared to patients treated with oral appliances . However , the meta-analyses ’ overall results showed a significant improvement in the  post-treatment apnea – hypopnea index ( AHI )  in favor of  CPAP  therapy as compared with the oral appliance group ( p < .001 ) . Meta-analyses showed unclear results for  sleepiness  with no significant differences in average post-treatment  Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ ESS ]  ( p = .203 ) , but significant differences in change in  ESS  from baseline favorable to CPAP treatment ( p = .047 ) . Further studies are needed . Compliance with treatment was 1.1 h per night significantly lower with CPAP than MAD ( p = .004 ) , which could explain why though  efficacy ( AHI )  is better with  CPAP  , no significant results are shown for  quality of life , cognitive , and functional outcomes .  Though  CPAP  is significantly more efficient in reducing  AHI  ( moderate quality of evidence ) , it has a significantly lower compliance result ing in no differences with MAD in  quality of life , cognitive , or functional outcomes .  Sleep medicine professionals should monitor treatment compliance and offer patients non-compliant with  CPAP  an oral appliance for treatment of OSA."
"nIdentifying modifiable risk factor for   exclusive breastfeeding  ( EBF ) interruption  is key for improving child health globally . There is no consensus about the effect of  pacifier  use on  EBF interruption .  Thus , the aim of this systematic review was to investigate the association between  pacifier  use and  EBF interruption  during the first six month . A search of CINAHL , Scopus , Web of Science , LILACS and Medline ; from inception through 30 December 2014 without restriction of language yielded  1,866 publications  ( PROSPERO protocol CRD42014014527 ) . Predetermined inclusion /exclusion criteria peer review ed yielded  46 studies : two clinical trials , 20 longitudinal , and 24 cross-sectional studies .  Meta- analysis was performed and meta-regression explored heterogeneity across studies . The pooled effect of the association between  pacifier   use and EBF interruption  was 2.48 OR ( 95 % CI = 2.16 - 2.85 ) . Heterogeneity was explained by the study design ( 40.2 % ) , followed by differences in the measurement and categorization of  pacifier  use , the method ological quality of the studies and the socio-economic context . Two RCT 's with very limited external validity found a null association , but  44  observational studies , including  20 prospect i ve cohort studies  , did find a consistent association between   pacifier  use and risk of EBF interruption  ( OR = 2.28 ; 95 % CI = 1.78 - 2.93 ) . Our findings support the current WHO recommendation on  pacifier  use as it focuses on the risk of  poor breastfeeding outcomes  as a result of  pacifier  use . Future studies that take into account the risks and benefits of  pacifier  use are needed to clarify this recommendation."
"sNonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) results from excessive fat accumulation in the liver in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption . Insulin resistance ( IR ) is proposed to be an underlying pathogenic factor in the development and progression of disease . There are currently no proven pharmacotherapies and weight loss is the only prescribed treatment despite a lack of evidence to support a specific diet or  lifestyle therapy .  The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of  dietary lifestyle interventions  on  IR  measured by  Homeostasis model assessment  in  patients with NAFLD .  A systematic electronic search of Medline , Scopus , The Cochrane Library , CINAHL and PubMed data bases ( 1999–2015 ) was performed by two independent review ers . R and omized control trials evaluating the efficacy of  diet and lifestyle interventions  on IR in  adults diagnosed with NAFLD  were included .  A total of 6441 articles were identified ;  eight r and omized control trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria . Three studies involved  dietary interventions  and five incorporated  diet and exercise .  The majority of intervention groups result ed in significant reductions in  IR  , with no significant changes observed in the control groups . Lifestyle interventions compared with controls reduced  IR  measured by  homeostasis model assessment .  All  diet and diet and lifestyle intervention  trials were efficient in  reducing IR  in  participants with NAFLD .  A lack of literature and variation across interventions warrants the need for extensive research to establish firm dietary lifestyle recommendations."
"PSTUDY DESIGN A systematic review of r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . OBJECTIVE To explore the evidence for the  effectiveness  of  acupuncture  for  nonspecific low back pain ( LBP ) .  SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Since the most recent systematic review s on RCTs on  acupuncture  for LBP ,  6 RCTs  have been published , which may impact on the previous conclusions . METHODS Search es were completed for RCTs on all types of  acupuncture  for  patients with nonspecific LBP published in English .  Method ologic quality was scored using the Van Tulder scale .  Trials  were deemed to be  high quality  if they  scored more than 6/11 on the Van Tulder scale  , carried out appropriate statistical analysis , with at least  40 patients per group  , and did not exceed 20 % and 30 % dropouts at short/intermediate and long-term follow-up , respectively . High quality trials were given more weight when conducting the best evidence synthesis . Studies were grouped according to the control interventions , i.e. ,  no treatment , sham intervention , conventional therapy , acupuncture in addition to conventional therapy .  Treatment effect size and clinical significance were also determined . The  adequacy of  acupuncture  treatment  was judged by comparison of recommendations made in textbooks , surveys , and review s. RESULTS  Twenty-three trials ( n = 6359 )  were included and classified into 5 types of comparisons , 6 of which were of high quality . There is moderate evidence that  acupuncture  is more  effective  than no treatment , and strong evidence of no significant difference between  acupuncture  and  sham acupuncture  , for  short-term pain relief .  There is strong evidence that  acupuncture  can be a useful supplement to other forms of  conventional  therapy for nonspecific LBP , but the effectiveness of  acupuncture  compared with other forms of conventional therapies still requires further investigation .   Acupuncture  versus  no treatment  , and as an adjunct to  conventional care  , should be advocated in the European Guidelines for the treatment of chronic LBP."

"nParkinson ’s disease ( PD ) is managed primarily by  dopamine agonists and physiotherapy  while  virtual reality ( VR )  has emerged recently as a complementary method . The present study review ed the effectiveness of   VR   in rehabilitation of  patients with PD .  Literature search  up to June 2019 identified ten studies ( n = 343 participants ) suitable for meta- analysis and 27 studies ( n = 688 participants ) for systematic review .   St  and  ard mean difference ( SMD )  and  95 % confidence intervals ( CI )  were calculated using a r and om effects model . In meta- analysis , compared with active  rehabilitation intervention , VR training  led to greater improvement of  stride length ,  SMD = 0.70 ( 95%CI = 0.32–1.08 , p = 0.0003 ) , and was as  effective for gait speed , balance and co-ordination , cognitive function and mental health , quality of life and activities of daily living .  Compared with passive  rehabilitation intervention , VR  had greater  effects on balance :  SMD = 1.02 ( 95%CI = 0.38–1.65 , p = 0.002 ) . Results from single r and omised controlled trials showed that  VR training  was better than  passive rehabilitation intervention  for  improving gait speed  SMD = 1.43 ( 95%CI = 0.51–2.34 , p =  0.002 ) , stride length  SMD = 1.27 ( 95%CI = 0.38–2.16 , p =  0.005  )  and activities of daily living  SMD = 0.96 ( 95%CI = 0.02–1.89 ) . Systematic review showed that  VR training  significantly ( p <  0.05  )  improved motor function , balance and co-ordination , cognitive function and mental health , and quality of life and activities of daily living .   VR  used in rehabilitation for  patients with PD  improves a number of outcomes and may be considered for routine use in rehabilitation."
"sLeukemia is the most commonly diagnosed childhood cancer , although its etiology is still largely unknown . Growing evidence supports a role for infection in the etiology of acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , and the involvement of the immune system suggests that vaccination may also play a role . However , the findings presented in the published literature are inconsistent . Therefore , we conducted a PRISMA systematic review and meta- analysis .  14 studies were identified and meta-analyzed .   Vaccinations  studied comprised  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) vaccine , Triple vaccine , Hepatitis B vaccine ( HBV ) , Polio , Measles , Rubella , Mumps , trivalent MMR vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B ( HiB ) vaccine .  We observed a protective association between  any vaccination  in the first  year  of  life and risk of childhood leukemia  ( summary odds ratio ( OR ) 0.58 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.36–0.91 ] ) . When individual vaccines were analysed , some evidence of an association was seen only for BCG ( summary OR 0.73 [ 95 % CI 0.50–1.08 ] ) . In conclusion , early  vaccination  appears to be associated with  a reduced risk of  childhood leukemia  .  This finding may be underpinned by the association observed for BCG . Given the relatively imprecise nature of the results of this meta- analysis , our findings should be interpreted cautiously and replicated in future studies."

We aim ed to determine the  efficacy and harm  associated with  chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone  in  elderly ( ≥70 years ) , stage III NSCLC patients  through a systematic review . We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE , EMBASE , CENTRAL , Scopus , Web of Science and conference proceedings . Two review ers independently identified r and omized trials ( RCT ) and extracted trial-level data . Risk of bias was assessed and meta- analysis was conducted looking  at survival and safety outcomes  . We included three trials and subgroup data from one systematic review . The three RCTs had high risk of bias due primarily to lack of blinding and the systematic review scored 4/11 using the AMSTAR  tool . Overall survival  ( HR 0.66 , 95 % CI 0.53 - 0.82 ; I2 0 % ; 3 trials ; 407 patients  ) and progression-free survival  ( HR 0.67 , 95 % CI 0.53 - 0.85 ; I2 0 % ; 2 trials ; 327 patients ) both favored chemoradiotherapy  . Risk of treatment-related death and grade 3 + pneumonitis  were not significantly different between groups . In conclusion , treatment of  stage III NSCLC patients 70 years or older   with chemotherapy and radiotherapy  is associated  with improved overall survival  compared  to radiotherapy  alone . With the  exception of increased hematological toxicity  , CRT appears to be tolerable in  fit elderly patients  and represents a reasonable st and ard of clinical care."
" There is no evidence to support the long-term use of  oral steroids  at doses less than 10 - 15 mg  prednisolone  though some evidence that higher doses ( > /= 30 mg prednisolone ) improve  lung function  over a short period . Potentially harmful adverse effects e.g ..  diabetes , hypertension  ,  osteoporosis  would prevent recommending long-term use at these high doses in most patients."
" The research showed that an effective survivorship program can significantly help  CRC survivors  maintain  good health and quality of life  for long periods . However , there is a lack of consensus and conclusive evidence regarding how the guidelines for such a program should be design ed , in terms of both its form and content."
 Existing interventions generally fail to maintain benefits derived from PR programs . Future studies should evaluate maintenance  interventions  that are theoretically-based and seek to impact known maintenance mediators . Evaluation of these interventions should include substantial follow-up periods and adherence measurements.
"eBACKGROUND The survival  rate  of  childhood cancer patients  increased over the past decades . However , even after successful treatment the transition back to normalcy is often a major challenge for the whole family . Therefore , this study aims to provide an overview of  psychosocial interventions  for  childhood cancer survivors and their families  in the first years after the end of cancer treatment . METHODS We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA Checklist ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ; PROSPERO registration number : CRD42017059782 ) . In November 2016 and September 2017 , we search ed the data bases CINAHL , MEDLINE , PSYNDEX , and Web of Science . We included studies investigating  psychosocial interventions  for  childhood cancer survivors diagnosed under the age of 21 , their family members or the family as a whole .  Further , we summarized the study characteristics and conducted a narrative synthesis of the results . Finally , we assessed the study quality with  the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool .  RESULTS  We identified a total of 8215 records based on our data base search es and 17 additional records through h and search es .  We included 33 articles in the qualitative synthesis . Most of the studies described interventions for the cancer survivor ( n = 15 ) . Nine studies investigated interventions for the whole family , and two studies interventions for siblings . The interventions mainly take place in an outpatient group setting ( n = 15 ) . Overall , most of the studies reported a significant  psychosocial benefit  of the interventions . However , the quality of the included studies was limited .  In summary , we identified a broad range of different interventions and thus could give a comprehensive overview of existing interventions for childhood cancer survivors and their families . However , there is a necessity for high quality studies . The results may help to optimize health care services that support families with the re-entry into daily life."
"dObjective To review the effectiveness of  classic Chinese acupuncture  in the treatment of   chronic pain   by comparing treatment groups with different  types of control groups  in accordance with the newly published guidelines for systematic review s. Methods We search ed EMBASE  , PubMed  ,  and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials data bases from 2000 to 2018 .  We included  r and omized  controlled trials that included  acupuncture  as the  sole  treatment or as an  adjunctive treatment  for   chronic pain .   The outcome was  pain intensity measured by the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) pain subscale , 11-point numeric rating scale ( NRS ) , and other tools .  Two research ers conducted the study selection , data extraction , and quality assessment processes independently . Disagreements were solved by discussion and re analysis of the data . The quality of all included studies was evaluated using the CBNG ( the Cochrane Back and Neck Group ) and the STRICTA ( St and ards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture ) checklists . Results  Sixty-one studies  were fully analyzed and ranked based on the newest STRICTA and CBNG st and ards . We found good evidence that receiving  acupuncture  is better than not receiving treatment or being placed on a waiting list and reasonable evidence that it is better than conventional or usual care . Limited evidence was found regarding  placebo  treatments that involve the expectation of needling ( real or fake ) . Conclusion  Sham acupuncture  may not be appropriate as a control intervention for assessing the effectiveness of  acupuncture . Acupuncture  effectiveness in controlling  chronic pain  is still limited due to the low quality of the studies published."
"kPenetration – aspiration is considered the most serious component of  oropharyngeal dysphagia .  Clinicians regularly evaluate the pathophysiology of swallowing and postulate reasons or mechanisms behind penetration – aspiration . In this article we share the results of a two-stage literature review design ed to eluci date the association between abnormalities in physiological measures of swallowing function and the occurrence of penetration – aspiration . In the first stage , a broad scoping review was undertaken using search terms for nine different structures involved in oropharyngeal swallowing . In the second stage , based on the results of the initial search , a more focused systematic review was undertaken which explored the association between aspiration and abnormalities in respiratory , tongue , hyoid , and laryngeal function in swallowing .  A total of 37 articles  underwent detailed quality review and data extraction in the systematic review . The results support measurement of  tongue strength , anatomically normalized measures of hyoid movement , bolus dwell time in the pharynx while the larynx remains open , respiratory rate , and respiratory swallow phasing  as parameters relevant to aspiration risk."
" In comparison with  placebo  , we have found an increased  risk  of  serious adverse events  with regular  formoterol  , and this does not appear to be abolished in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids  .  The effect on  serious adverse events  of regular  formoterol  in children was greater than the effect in adults , but the difference between age-groups was not significant . Data on all-cause  serious  adverse events should be more fully reported in journal articles , and not combined with all adverse events or limited to those events that are thought by the investigator to be drug-related."
"dCancer-related  fatigue ( CRF )  is a distressing symptom that affects the quality of life ( QOL ) of  patients with breast cancer and their families .  The effectiveness of pharmacologic therapies alone has not been sufficient in the management of CRF ; therefore , a combination of pharmacologic and  nonpharmacologic  approaches is justified . The purpose of this article is to critically review the literature related to  nonpharmacologic supportive strategies  in enhancing  QOL  among  patients with breast cancer experiencing CRF .  The results show that  exercises (  e.g. ,  home-based exercise , supervised exercise ) , education and counseling , sleep therapy ,  and  complementary therapy  are feasible as effective nonpharmacologic supportive interventions to  improve QOL  in patients with breast cancer suffering from CRF . Therefore , nurses may consider these  nonpharmacologic supportive strategies  as adjunctive interventions to pharmacologic interventions in enhancing  QOL  for patients with breast cancer experiencing CRF . However , because previous studies had some method ologic limitations , such as small sample size , lack of objective measures , or predominantly  Caucasian  sample , future research to further explore  nonpharmacologic interventions  in this area is warranted."
"4Inhaled  bronchodilators including long-acting beta-agonist ( LABA ) and long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA )  play a central role in the treatment of  stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .  However , it is still unclear whether  LABA  or  LAMA  should be used for the initial treatment . Therefore , we conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the  efficacy and safety  of  LABA versus LAMA  in  patients with stable COPD .  We search ed relevant r and omized control trials ( RCTs )  with a period of treatment of at least 12 weeks  and analyzed the  exacerbations , quality of life , dyspnea score , lung function and adverse events  as the outcomes of interest . We carefully excluded unblinded data and identified a total  of 19 RCTs ( N = 28,211 ) .   LAMA  significantly decreased  the exacerbations  compared to  LABA  ( OR 0.85 , 95 % CI 0.74 to 0.98 ; P = 0.02 ) .  In St George ’s Respiratory Question naire and transitional dyspnoea index score  , there were no differences between  LABA and LAMA  treatment . Compared to  LABA  , there was a small but significant  increase  in  the trough FEV1  after  LAMA  treatment ( Mean difference 0.02 , 95 % CI 0.01 to 0.03 , P = 0.0006 ) . In  the safety components  , there was no difference in  the serious adverse events  between  LABA  and  LAMA  .  However  ,  LAMA  showed a significantly  lower incidence of total adverse events  compared to  LABA  ( OR 0.92 , 95 % CI 0.86 to 0.98 ; P = 0.02 ) . Treatment with  LAMA  in stable COPD provided a significantly  lower incidence of exacerbation and non-serious adverse events  , and  a higher trough FEV1  compared to  LABA .

"4INTRODUCTION  Lower tidal volume ventilation  in  patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS )  is a strategy to reduce the plateau pressure and driving pressure to limit  ventilator-induced lung injury  ( VILI ) . Several r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) and meta-analyses showed that limiting both the plateau pressure and the tidal volume decreased mortality , but the optimal plateau pressure to demonstrate a benefit is uncertain . The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the optimal upper limit of plateau pressure in  patients with ARDS  to prevent VILI and improve  clinical outcomes  using meta- analysis with and without meta-regression . METHODS AND ANALYSIS RCTs comparing two mechanical ventilation strategies will be included , with lower plateau pressure and with higher plateau pressure , among  patients with ARDS and acute lung injury .  Data sources include MEDLINE via the NCBI Entrez system , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , EMBASE and Ichushi , a data base of papers in  Japanese . Two of three physicians will independently screen trials  obtained by search for eligibility , and extract data from included studies onto st and ardised data recording forms . For each included trial , the  risk of bias and the quality of evidence  will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendation  Assessment  Development  and Evaluation system  . ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study does not require ethical approval . The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis with and without meta-regression will be disseminated through conference presentation and publication in a peer- review ed journal . TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42016041924."
"tIn this quantitative systematic review we assessed the effects of  ventilation with smaller tidal volume ( VT )  on  morbidity  and mortality  in patients aged 16 yr or older affected by acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome . Five r and omized trials ( 1202 patients )  comparing  ventilation  using  smaller VT  and  /or low airway driving pressure  ( plateau pressure 30 cm H2O or less ) , result ing in  VT  of 7 mL/kg or less versus  ventilation  that uses  VT  in the range of 10 to 15 mL/kg , were identified after a systematic search of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , data bases of current research , reference lists , and "" gray literature . ""  Mortality at day 28  was significantly reduced by  lung-protective ventilation  ( relative risk [ RR ] , 0.74 ; confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.61 - 0.88 ) , whereas beneficial effect on  long-term mortality  was uncertain ( RR , 0.84 ; CI , 0.68 - 1.05 ) . The comparison between  small and conventional VT  was  not significantly different  if a  plateau pressure  less than or equal to 31 cm H2O in the control group was used ( RR , 1.13 ; CI , 0.88 - 1.45 ) . Clinical heterogeneity , such as different lengths of follow-up and higher  plateau pressures  in control arms in two trials , make the interpretation of the combined results difficult."
" : Primary care providers , in collaboration with clinician specialists , must be vigilant in providing consistent long-term care . This approach will ensure clear constant communication to help address the challenges faced by the families and survivors as they progress through adulthood . Implication s for cancer survivors : Encouraging primary care providers to become knowledgeable and comfortable in utilizing appropriate re sources is achieved through consultation with oncology or psychiatric specialists or with online re sources for safer management of childhood cancer survivors . The implication s for this patient population would ultimately allow for a more patient-centred approach to therapy."

"sSeveral studies and review s regarding the supplementation of  omega-3 LC-PUFAs  have been developed during the last years . Indeed , the evidence states that high doses  omega-3 LC-PUFAs  produce a small but significant decrease in  blood pressure  in  older and hypertensive subjects .  Due to the increasing interest in the benefits of  LC-PUFAs  , we aim ed to evaluate the scientific evidence provided in the past five years ( 2012 - 2016 ) on the effects of the intake of  omega-3 LC-PUFAs  on cardiovascular risk factors such as inflammation and oxidative  stress  , through a systematic review in PubMed data base .  Twenty-eight articles were related to cardiovascular disease ( CVD )  and are included in this systematic review .  The studies included healthy subjects and CVD patients ; we  included the  number of subjects  , type of study , type and doses of  omega-3 LC-PUFAs  , primary outcomes , and results . The use of  omega-3 LC-PUFAs  for ameliorating  CVD risk factors  can be recommended . However , the administration  of omega-3  does not seem to show any  benefit  for the management of CVD or associated complications."
"sBackground Diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality in  children under 5 years  along with its long-term impact on growth and cognitive development . Despite advances in the underst and ing of diarrheal disorders and management strategies , globally nearly 750,000  children  die annually as a consequence of diarrhea . Methods We conducted a systematic review of the efficacy and effectiveness studies . We used a st and ardized abstract ion and grading format and performed meta-analyses for all outcomes . The estimated effect of  cholera , shigella , Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) and rotavirus vaccines  was determined by applying the st and ard Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group ( CHERG ) rules . Results A  total  of  24 papers were selected  and analyzed for all the four vaccines . Based on the evidence , we propose a 74 %  mortality reduction in rotavirus specific mortality  , 52 % reduction in  cholera incidence  due to their respective vaccines . We did not find sufficient evidence and a suitable outcome to project  mortality reductions  for cholera , ETEC and shigella in  children  under 5 years . Conclusion  Vaccines  for rotavirus and cholera have the potential to reduce  diarrhea morbidity  and  mortality  burden . But there is no substantial evidence of efficacy for ETEC and shigella vaccines , although several promising vaccine concepts are moving from the development and testing pipeline towards efficacy and Phase 3 trials."

"kOBJECTIVES To compare the effect of  donor breast milk  with infant formula in  preterm infants .  Separate comparisons with formula were made for  donor breast milk  that was : ( 1 ) given as a sole diet ; ( 2 ) given as a supplement to mother 's own breast milk  ;  and ( 3 )  fortified with macronutrients and micronutrients .  The main outcomes were  death , necrotising enterocolitis ( NEC ) , infection , growth and development .  DATA SOURCES Electronic data bases-Cochrane , CENTRAL , MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , and HMIC : DH . REVIEW METHODS Systematic review and meta- analysis of trials and observational studies of  preterm or low birthweight infants .  RESULTS  Seven studies ( including five r and omised controlled trials ) , all from the 1970s and 1980s  , fulfilled the inclusion criteria . All studies compared the  effect of  sole donor breast milk   with   formula   ( combined n =  471  ) . One of these also compared the effect of  donor breast  milk   with  formula  given as a supplement to mother 's own milk ( n = 343 ) . No studies examined  fortified donor breast milk .  A meta- analysis based on three studies found a  lower risk of NEC  in  infants receiving donor breast milk compared with formula  ( combined RR 0.21 , 95 % CI 0.06 to 0.76 ) . Donor breast milk was associated with  slower growth  in the early postnatal period , but its long-term effect is unclear .  Donor breast milk is associated with a  lower risk of NEC  and  slower growth  in the early postnatal period , but the quality of the evidence is limited . Further research is needed to confirm these findings and measure the effect of fortified or supplemented donor breast milk."

"sEsophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the world . Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) accounts for 90 % of esophageal cancer cases , over half of which occur in  China  . Linxian , a county located in the North Central Taihang Mountain range , has the highest ESCC mortality rate , which may be the leading cause of death in this area . In a decades-long research program in Linxian , Chinese and international scientists have exerted great efforts to describe the epidemiological characteristics and eluci date the etiology of ESCC . A systematic review and summary of the current knowledge gained from previous research is informative for future ESCC prevention and control in similar population s , and may be translated to other high-incidence countries , such as Brazil , Iran , Malawi , and South Africa . As ESCC is a major cause of cancer death , more research is required in China and in other high-incidence countries to deepen our underst and ing of the etiology of ESCC and develop preventative strategies."
":Background Cerebral palsy is a life-long disability that affects motor control and activities of daily living . Depending on the type  of cerebral palsy  , some  individuals  may have trouble performing tasks with one or both of their arms and /or legs . Different strategies exist to help develop  motor capacity .   Biofeedback therapy  is a commonly applied rehabilitation strategy . In  biofeedback therapy  , information about the motor  behavior  while completing a task is given back to the individual to help improve their performance . This can provide valuable information that would otherwise be unknown to the individual . Biofeedback may also have a unique method of operation in clinical population s , such as  people with cerebral palsy .  Therefore , it is important to identify the most effective mechanisms for specific population s. This review aims to evaluate the  effects of  biofeedback interventions   that have been used towards improving  motor performance and motor learning  in  people with cerebral palsy .  Methods Using a customized strategy , MEDLINE , CINAHL , Embase , PsycINFO , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , SCOPUS , SPORTD iscus , and PEDro data bases will be search ed . Two independent review ers will screen titles and abstract s , review full texts for inclusion criteria , and extract data from relevant articles using a st and ardized template .  Quality of evidence  and  risk of bias  will be assessed through the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE )  methodology . Discussion Several studies have investigated biofeedback-based interventions for  people with cerebral palsy .  However , there is a great variety and limited consensus regarding how to implement biofeedback mechanisms . This systematic review will consoli date the current evidence to direct future study and develop effective biofeedback rehabilitation strategies . Systematic review registration PROSPERO ID :."

 Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow firm conclusions regarding the  efficacy  and  safety  of  glutamine  for induction of remission in Crohn 's disease . Data from two small studies suggest that  glutamine supplementation  may not be beneficial in active Crohn 's disease but these results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients . This review highlights the need for adequately powered r and omised controlled trials to investigate the  efficacy  and  safety  of  glutamine  for induction of remission in Crohn 's disease.

Relevant studies were identified from a systematic MEDLINE and EMBASE search of studies published  from 1985 to 2019 .  Studies were included if they were RCTs . If no RCTs were identified , prospect i ve and retrospecctive comparative studies ( where confounders are controlled for studies with greater than 30 patients ) were included .  Overall survival , progression-free survival , recurrence-free survival , adverse events and quality of life  data were extracted . For  patients with newly diagnosed , primary stage III epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma  ,  HIPEC with CRS  should be considered for those with at least stable disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the time of interval CRS if complete or optimal cytoreduction is achieved . There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of  HIPEC  when primary  CRS  is performed for  patients with newly diagnosed , primary advanced epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma or in those with recurrent ovarian cancer  outside of a clinical trial . There is insufficient evidence to recommend  HIPEC with CRS  for the prevention of or for the treatment  of peritoneal colorectal carcinomatosis  outside of a clinical trial . There is insufficient evidence to recommend  HIPEC with CRS  for the prevention of  or  for the  treatment of gastric peritoneal carcinomatosis  outside of a clinical trial . There is insufficient evidence to recommend  HIPEC with CRS  in  patients with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma or in those with disseminated mucinous neoplasm in the appendix  as a st and ard of care ; however , these patients should be referred to  HIPEC  specialty centres for assessment for treatment as part of an ongoing research protocol."
"eThis systematic literature review ( SLR ) had two objectives : to analyse published economic evaluations of   biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs ( bDMARDs )  for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) previously treated with  DMARDs   and to assess the quality of those that included sequences of treatments . We performed an SLR on PubMed , Central , Cochrane , and  French  data bases from January 2000 to December 2018 . The search focused on cost-effectiveness/utility/benefit analyses . We extracted data on treatment sequences , outcomes ( e.g. quality -adjusted life year ) and choices of economic evaluation methods ( e.g. model type , type of analysis , and method of utility estimation ) . We analysed the improvement of methods by comparing two sub-periods ( 2000–2009 and 2010–2018 ) . The  quality of reporting and  the  quality of the methods  were assessed using the Consoli date d Health Economic Evaluation Reporting St and ards ( CHEERS ) and a set of eight key aspects for a reference case for economic evaluation of bDMARDs based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology ( OMERACT ) and Drummond checklists . Data extraction and study assessment were performed independently by two health economists . From  the 824 records identified in the initial search  ,  51 publications were selected .  Of these , 31 included sequences . Individual models such as discrete-event simulations were used in over two-fifths ( 22/51 , 43 % ) of the selected studies . Few studies ( 7/51 , 14 % ) used  utility scores  based on generic instruments ( e.g. EQ-5D  ) . Estimation of hospitalization costs  was described in only approximately one-third of studies ( 19/51 ) .  Loss of quality of life ( QoL )  related to  adverse events  such as tuberculosis and  pneumonia  was included in one-tenth ( 5/51 , 10 % ) of the studies . It was difficult to compare the results of the economic evaluations ( i.e. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ) due to the high heterogeneity of studies in terms of disease stage , data sources , inputs , and methods of health outcome assessment used . For identified studies including sequences , the CHEERS assessment of reporting quality showed insufficient reporting of uncertainty analyses and utility weights in more than a third of the studies ( 11/31 , 35 % ; 9/25 , 36 % ) . An in-depth assessment of the quality of the studies revealed that only seven , mostly conducted during the sub-period 2010–2018 , addressed the majority of method ological quality assessment issues such as the  simulation of patient sequence pathways  , the use of systematic review s and meta-analyses of comparative effectiveness , the choice of treatment sequence , and  rules for switching  . Our SLR identified a lack of high- quality evaluations assessing  bDMARD sequences  , although some improvements were made in the reporting and modelling of patients ’ pathways in studies published after 2010 . In order to improve  economic evaluations  of RA , clear health technology assessment guidance on  RA health-related QoL instruments  must be provided , and data including  long-term disease progression  must be made available."
">Abstract Objective : This review determines the effects of  virtual reality interventions  for  stroke subjects  based on the International Classification of Functioning , Disability , and Health ( ICF ) framework .  Virtual reality  is a promising tool for therapy for stroke rehabilitation , but the effects of  virtual reality interventions  on  post-stroke patients  based on the specific ICF domains ( Body Structures , Body Functions , Activity , and Participation ) have not been investigated . Method : A systematic review was conducted , including trials  with adults with a clinical diagnosis of a chronic , subacute , or acute stroke .  Eligible trials had to include studies with an intervention protocol and follow-up , with a focus on upper limbs and /or lower limbs and /or balance . The Physiotherapy Evidence Data base ( PEDro ) was used to assess the method ological quality of r and omized controlled trials . Each trial was separated according to method ological quality into a high- quality trial ( PEDro ≥ 6 ) and a low- quality trial ( PEDro ≤ 6 ) . Only high- quality trials were analyzed specifically based on the outcome of these trials . Results : In total ,  54 trials involving 1811 participants were included .  Of the papers included and considered high quality , 14 trials  evaluated areas of the Body Structures component  , 20 trials of the  Body Functions  domain , 17 trials of the  Activity  component , and 8 trials of the Participation domain . In relation to ICF Part 2 , four trials  evaluated areas of the Personal Factors component  and one trial  evaluated domains of the Environmental Factors  component . Discussion : The effects  of virtual reality  on stroke rehabilitation based on the ICF framework  are positive in Body Function and Body Structure  . However , the results in the  domains Activity and Participation  are inconclusive . More high- quality clinical trials are needed to confirm the  effectiveness of virtual  reality in the domains of  Activity  and  Participation ."
"sBackground The use of  social or behavioral theories  within  exercise-related injury prevention program ( ERIPP )  research may lead to a better underst and ing of why adherence to the programs is low and inform the development of interventions to improve program adherence . There is a need to determine which theories have been used within the literature and at what level theory was used to further the field . Objective To determine which  social or behavioral science theories  have been incorporated within ERIPP research and assess the level at which the theories were used . The key question guiding the search was “ What  social or behavioral theories  have been used within ERIPP research ? ” Methods A systematic review of the literature was completed with an appraisal of bias risk using a custom critical appraisal tool . An electronic search of EBSCOhost ( Academic Search Complete , CINAHL , Medline , Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection ) and PubMed was completed from inception to October 2018 . Studies investigating   attitudes towards ERIPP  participation  with the use of a  social or behavioral theoretical model  or  framework  were eligible for inclusion . Results The  electronic  search returned  7482 results and two articles were identified though a h and search  , which result ed in  ten articles meeting  inclusion criteria . Four different behavioral or social theoretical models or frameworks were identified including the   health action process approach  model  ,   health belief model   ,   self-determination  theory  , and   theory of planned behavior .   Six studies utilized the theory at a B level meaning a theoretical construct was measured while four utilized the theory at the C level meaning the theory was tested . The  mean critical appraisal score  was 78 % , indicating a majority of the studies were higher quality . Conclusion There has been an increase in the use of theory within literature that is specific to  ERIPP participation .  Additionally , the use of theory has shifted from guiding program design to the measurement of theoretical constructs and testing of the theoretical models."
"sPurpose Many  cancer survivors  experience problems with  persisting symptoms  such as  pain , fatigue , anxiety and depression  post-treatment .  Self-management interventions  are recommended for  cancer patients  as they can help individuals identify and manage these continuing symptoms . This systematic review examines the type , content and impact of  self-management interventions  for  cancer survivors  on health outcomes such as  activity participation , self-efficacy , quality of life and symptom management .  Methods This was a systematic review of the English language scientific literature search ed for r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) , systematic review s and meta-analyses of self-management programmes conducted with  cancer survivors .  Six data bases were systematic ally search ed . Results Initial search es yielded  2633 citations .  Following screening and a risk of bias assessment ,  six studies  were included in the final review . Heterogeneity of the interventions precluded meta- analysis . Three studies reported significant differences between groups in a number of areas including  fatigue , physical functioning , distress and self-efficacy  at their first follow-up assessment . These studies included two psychosocial interventions and one  exercise and diet intervention .  Not all findings were sustained across studies at follow-up assessment . Conclusion It is not possible to draw definitive conclusions as to the impact the different types of self-management programme had on  cancer survivors .  The sustainability of the interventions review ed was poor , suggesting that cancer survivors require interventions that can be applied into their daily activities."
" Considering the proportion of  children affected  with  PEM  world-wide , there have been relatively few pharmacokinetic studies of drugs frequently used for their treatment . More studies are therefore required to establish the appropriate dose and safety of these drugs for  PEM children .  The studies need to recognise that PEM is a disease spectrum and should further look at the differential effects of kwashiorkor and marasmus on drug  pharmacokinetics  in children."
"  Exercise  during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer can be regarded as a supportive self care intervention that probably results in less  fatigue , improved physical fitness  , and little or no difference in  cancer-specific quality of life and depression .   Exercise  may also slightly improve  cancer site-specific quality of life and cognitive function  , while it may result in little or no difference in  health-related quality of life .  This review is based on trials with a considerable degree of clinical heterogeneity regarding  adjuvant cancer treatments and exercise interventions .  Due to the difficulty of blinding exercise trials , all included trials were at high risk for performance bias . Furthermore , the majority of trials were at high risk for detection bias , largely due to most outcomes being self reported . The findings of the up date d review have enabled us to make a more precise conclusion that both  aerobic and resistance exercise  can be regarded as beneficial for  individuals  with  adjuvant therapy-related side effects .  Further research is required to determine the optimal type , intensity , and timing of an  exercise intervention .  Furthermore , long-term evaluation is required due to possible long-term side effects of adjuvant treatment."

"yExergames have been suggested as an innovative approach to enhance  physical  activity  in the elderly .  The objective of this review was to determine the  effectiveness  of  exergames  on  vali date  d  quantitative physical outcomes  in  healthy elderly individuals .  We used Centre for Review and Disseminations guidance to conduct systematic review s. Four electronic data bases were search ed . We included r and  omized controlled  trials  ( RCTs )  ,  the study participants were healthy elderly individuals  , and the intervention of interest was  exergaming .  The title  and abstract screening of the 1861 citations identified 36 studies as potentially eligible for this review  , and an additional  nine were  identified from reference lists . The full text screening identified  seven studies with a total of 311 participants  , all reporting RCTs with low-to-moderate method ological quality . Six of the seven studies found a  positive effect of  exergaming  on the health of the elderly  . However , the variation of intervention approaches and outcome data collected limited the extent to which studies could be compared . This review demonstrates how  exergames  have a potential to  improve physical health  in the elderly . However , there is a need for additional and better- design ed studies that assess the  effectiveness and long-term adherence  of  exergames design ed  specifically for the elderly."
"sDietary patterns may be related to  quality of life ( QoL )  of  older adults  , although evidence from literature is conflicting . The demographic shifts toward ageing population s in many countries increases the importance of underst and ing the relationship between diet and QoL in older adults . This review was design ed to investigate associations between  dietary patterns   and QoL in older adults .  The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review s and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines .  Eight electronic data bases were  search ed to identify  articles published in English from January 1975 to March 2018 that investigated associations between dietary patterns and QoL in older adults .  Relevant studies were identified based on set inclusion and exclusion criteria , data were extracted and analysed to examine the relationships and possible implication s for public health recommendations . The systematic review included  15 articles ( One r and omized control trial , six prospect i ve cohorts and eight cross sectional ) .  The studies looked at correlations between  different dietary patterns  and /or adherence to  particular  dietary patterns  and self-reported QoL or self-rated health status .  Excluding two studies which showed no significant association ,  healthy dietary patterns  were associated with better  self-rated health and QoL  in one or more domains , and adherence to  healthy dietary  patterns like the Mediterranean diet were significantly associated with improvement in at least one of the  QoL  domains."
" Individualised risk estimates may be effective for purpose s of population health , but their effects on increasing  uptake  of  screening  programmes may not be interpretable as evidence of informed decision making by patients . Greater attention is required to ways of developing interventions for screening programmes that can achieve this."
"wPURPOSE OF REVIEW Accurate assessment of  dietary  intake in interventional trials is the key to evaluate changes in dietary behaviour and compliance . We evaluated the use of  dietary assessment tools  in  r and omized trials on diet-based interventions in pregnancy  by a systematic review . RECENT FINDINGS We up date d our previous search  (  until  January 2012 )  on  trials of diet and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy  using Medline and EMBASE up to December 2015 . Two independent review ers undertook study selection and data extraction . We assessed the characteristics of  dietary  assessment  tools  , the timing and frequency of use and any validation undertaken . Two-thirds ( 39/58 , 67 % ) of the included studies used some form of  tools  to   assess dietary intake . Multiple days ' food diaries   were the most commonly used ( 23/39 , 59 % ) . Three studies ( 3/39 , 8 % ) vali date d the used tools in  a pregnant population .  Three studies ( 3/39 , 8 % ) prespecified the criteria for adherence to the intervention . The use of  dietary assessment tools  was not associated with  study quality , year of publication , journal impact factor , type of journal  and the study sample size . SUMMARY Although  self-reporting dietary assessment tools  are widely used in interventional  dietary trials in pregnancy  , the quality and applicability of existing tools are low."
"yBACKGROUND / PURPOSE Despite its widespread use , no r and omised studies have investigated the value of  perioperative systemic therapy  as adjunct to cytoreduction and HIPEC for  colorectal peritoneal metastases .  This systematic review evaluated the available evidence , which consists of non-r and omised studies only . METHODS A systematic search identified studies that investigated the influence of  neoadjuvant , adjuvant , or perioperative systemic therapy  on  overall survival ( OS ) .  RESULTS The  11 included studies ( n=1708 )  were clinical ly heterogeneous and subject to selection bias . Studies on  neoadjuvant systemic therapy  revealed  OS benefit  ( n=3 ) ,  no OS benefit  ( n=1 ) , and superiority of  chemotherapy with bevacizumab vs. chemotherapy  ( n=2 ) . Studies on  adjuvant systemic therapy  showed  no OS benefit  ( n=3 ) . Studies on  perioperative systemic therapy  demonstrated  OS benefit  ( n=1 ) , and superiority of modern  vs. conventional systemic therapy(n=1  ) .  Significant limitations of available evidence question the widespread use of  perioperative systemic therapy  in this setting , stress the need for r and omised studies , and impede conclusions regarding optimal timing and regimens . Included studies may suggest a  survival  benefit of neoadjuvant systemic therapy."
"tTo compare the relative efficacy of current and investigational  biologic and oral small molecule ( OSM )  treatments for  active ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) .  A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all phase  2/3 r  and  omized  trials  of interest in patients with AS .  Outcomes assessed were ≥  20 % improvement in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Criteria ( ASAS20 )  and change from  baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index ( BASFI ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP )  at weeks 12–16 . Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted for outcomes using a r and om effects model . Baseline-risk adjustment was also conducted to account for differences in placebo response across studies .  Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve ( SUCRA ) values  are reported , reflecting the relative probability that intervention was the best of all interventions . The investigational agent  tofacitinib  5 mg was the top-ranked treatment ( SUCRA , 93 % ) for ASAS20 response , followed by  intravenous ( IV ) golimumab  2 mg/kg ( 90 %  )  . Golimumab IV 2 mg/kg and  infliximab  5 mg/kg were the top two ranked treatments for change from  baseline in BASFI  ( golimumab IV , 81 %  ;  infliximab , 80 % ) and  change from baseline in CRP   (  infliximab , 90 % ; golimumab IV , 82 % ) . Two approved therapies  ( golimumab  IV  , infliximab  ) and one investigational product ranked highest  for efficacy  in AS . Key Points • Although golimumab IV  ,  infliximab , and tofacitinib ranked highest for efficacy in AS , differences in efficacy between approved and investigational therapies were not statistically significant . Key Points • Although golimumab IV  ,  infliximab , and tofacitinib ranked highest for efficacy in AS , differences in efficacy between approved and investigational therapies were not statistically significant."
" The findings indicated that  radiologically confirmed pneumonia  , as a severe morbidity proxy for mortality , provided better estimates for the LiST model of effect of interventions on mortality reduction than did other outcomes evaluated . The LiST model will use this to estimate the  pneumonia mortality  reduction which might be observed when scaling up  Hib and PC conjugate vaccination  in the context of an overall package of child health interventions."
"dBackground To assess the scope , volume and quality of research on the  acceptability , utilisation and effectiveness of  telephone- and computer-delivered interventions   for  caregivers of people living with dementia .  Methods Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL and Cochrane data bases were search ed  ( Jan  1990  – Dec 2016 )  . Eligible papers were classified as data -based descriptive , measurement or intervention studies . Intervention studies were first categorised according to mode of delivery ( e.g.  telephone , computer )  ; then assessed against the  Effective Practice and Organisation of Care  ( EPOC ) method ological criteria for research design .  Impact on health-related outcomes ;  and the  acceptability , feasibility and utilisation of interventions  were also assessed . Results The  number of publications  increased by 13 % each year ( p < 0.001 ) . Half were descriptive studies ( n = 92 , 50 % ) describing caregiver  views on acceptability , access or utilization of technology .  The remainder ( n = 89 , 48 % ) reported on interventions design ed to improve  caregiver outcomes .  Only  34  met EPOC design criteria . Interventions were delivered  via computer  ( n = 10 ) ,  multiple modalities  ( n = 9 ) or  telephone  ( n = 15 ) . Interventions that incorporated various elements  of  psycho-education  ,  peer  support ,  skills  training and  health  assessment s  led to  improvements in caregiver wellbeing .  While largely acceptable , utilisation of computer-based interventions was variable , with use often decreasing over time . Conclusion Interventions delivered via telephone and computer have the potential to augment existing dementia care . High- quality trials are required to make clear recommendations about the types of interventions that are most effective . Those that provide  caregivers  with : access to practical strategies to manage care of the person with dementia and their own wellbeing , advice and support from peers and /or clinicians ; and that target the dyad should be explored."
" Overall , this review shows that  psychosocial interventions  may have small , short-term beneficial effects on certain domains of well-being , as measured by the  physical component of GHQoL and cancer-related QoL  when compared with  usual care .  Prostate cancer  knowledge  was also increased . However , this review failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on other domains such as  symptom-related QoL , self-efficacy , uncertainty , distress or depression .  Moreover , when beneficial effects were observed , it remained uncertain whether the magnitude of effect was large enough to be considered clinical ly important . The quality of evidence for most outcomes was rated as very low according to GRADE , reflecting study limitations , loss to follow-up , study heterogeneity and small sample sizes . We were unable to perform meaningful subgroup analyses based on disease stage or treatment modality . Although some findings of this review are encouraging , they do not provide sufficiently strong evidence to permit meaningful conclusions about the effects of these interventions in  men with prostate cancer .  Additional well-done and transparently reported research studies are necessary to establish the role of  psychosocial interventions  in men with prostate cancer."
"dAim : To determine the dose of  activity-related arm training  undertaken by  stroke survivors during acute and subacute rehabilitation .  Methods : A systematic review of PubMed , CINAHL and EMBASE up to December 2014 was completed . Studies were eligible if they defined the dose  ( time or repetitions )  of  activity-related arm training  using  observational methods  for a  cohort of adult stroke survivors receiving acute or subacute rehabilitation .  All studies were quality appraised using an evidence -based learning critical appraisal checklist . Data was analysed by method of documented  dose per session ( minutes  , repetitions ) , environment (  acute or subacute rehabilitation  ) and therapy discipline  ( physiotherapy  ,  occupational therapy  ) . Results :  Ten studies were included : two observed stroke survivors during acute rehabilitation and eight during subacute rehabilitation .  During acute rehabilitation , one study reported 4.1 minutes per session during  physiotherapy  and 11.2 minutes during  occupational therapy  , while another study reported 5.7 minutes per session during  physiotherapy  only . During inpatient rehabilitation  ,  activity-related arm training   was on average undertaken for 4 minutes per session ( range 0.9 to 7.9 , n = 4 studies ) during physiotherapy and 17 minutes per session ( range 9.3 to 28.9 , n = 3 studies ) during occupational therapy .  Repetitions per session  were reported by two studies only during subacute rehabilitation . One study reported 23  repetitions per session  during physiotherapy and occupational therapy , while another reported 32  repetitions  per session across both disciplines . Conclusion : The dose of  activity-related arm training  during acute and subacute rehabilitation after stroke is limited."

"  Verbal face-to-face feedback  in the health professions may result in a moderate to large improvement in  workplace task performance  , compared with  no feedback .  However , the quality of evidence was low , primarily due to risk of bias and publication bias . Further research is needed .

"sLack of adherence to health-promoting advice challenges the successful prevention and management of many conditions . The  Health Belief Model ( HBM )  was developed in 1966 to predict health-promoting behaviour and has been used in  patients with wide variety of disease .  The  HBM  has also been used to inform the development of interventions to improve  health behaviours .  Several review s have documented the  HBM 's  performance in predicting behaviour , but no review has addressed its utility in the design of interventions or the efficacy of these interventions . A systematic review was conducted to identify interventional studies which use the  HBM  as the theoretical basis for intervention design . The  HBM  has been used continuously in the development of behaviour change interventions for 40 years . Of  18 eligible studies  , 14 ( 78 % ) reported significant improvements in  adherence  , with 7 ( 39 % ) showing moderate to large effects . However , only six studies used the  HBM  in its entirety and five different studies measured  health beliefs  as  outcomes  . Intervention success appeared to be unrelated to  HBM  construct addressed challenging the utility of this model as the theoretical basis for adherence-enhancing interventions . Interventions need to be described in full to allow for the identification of effective components and replication of studies."

"hRates of childhood obesity are increasing , and it is essential to identify the active components of interventions aim ing to prevent and manage  obesity in children .  A systematic review of  behaviour change interventions  was conducted to find evidence of  behaviour change techniques ( BCTs )  that are most effective in changing physical activity and /or eating behaviour for the prevention or management of  childhood obesity  . An electronic search was conducted for r and  omised  controlled trials published between January 1990 and December 2009  . Of 4309 titles and abstract s screened , full texts of 135 articles were assessed , of which 17 published articles were included in this review .  Intervention descriptions were coded according to the behaviour-specific CALO-RE taxonomy of BCTs . BCTs were identified and compared across obesity management ( n=9 ) vs prevention ( n=8 ) trials . To assess the effectiveness of individual BCTs , trials were further divided into those that were effective ( defined as either a group reduction of at least 0.13  body mass index (  BMI ) units or a significant difference in  BMI  between intervention and control groups at follow-up ) vs non-effective ( reported no significant differences between groups ) . We reliably identified BCTs utilised in effective and non-effective prevention and management trials . To illustrate the relative effectiveness of each BCT ,  effectiveness ratios  were calculated as the ratio of the number of times each BCT was a component of an intervention in an effective trial divided by the number of times they were a component of all trials . Results indicated six BCTs that may be effective components of future management interventions ( provide information on the consequences of behaviour to the individual , environmental restructuring , prompt practice , prompt identification as role model/position advocate , stress management/emotional control training and general communication skills training ) , and one that may be effective in prevention interventions ( prompting generalisation of a target behaviour ) . We identified that for management trials , providing information on the consequences of behaviour in general was a feature of non-effective interventions and for prevention trials , providing information on the consequences of behaviour in general , providing rewards contingent on successful behaviour and facilitating social comparison were non-effective . To design effective  behaviour change programmes  for the prevention and management of childhood obesity , we would recommend utilising the BCTs identified as effective in this review . The impact on intervention effectiveness of combining BCTs should be the topic of further research."
"sWhile several studies have documented an increased risk of  metabolic disorders  in  patients with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS )  , associations between and rogenic and metabolic parameters in these patients are unclear . We aim ed to investigate the relationships between biochemical markers of  hyper and rogenism  ( HA ) and metabolic parameters in  women with PCOS .  In this systematic review and meta- analysis , a literature search was performed in the PubMed , Scopus , Google Scholar , ScienceDirect , and Web of Science from 2000 to 2018 for assessing and rogenic and metabolic parameters in  PCOS patients .  To assess the relationships between and rogenic and metabolic parameters ,  meta-regression analysis  was used .  A total number of 33 studies involving 9905 patients with PCOS were included  in this analysis . The associations  of  total testosterone  (  tT  )  with  metabolic parameters  were not significant ; after adjustment for age and BMI , we detected associations of this and rogen  with low-density lipoproteins cholesterol ( LDL-C  ) ( β=0.006 ; 95 % CI : 0.002 ,  0.01 ) , high-density lipoproteins cholesterol ( HDL-C  ) ( β=-0.009 ; 95 % CI :  -0.02  ,  -0.001 ) , and systolic blood pressure  ( SBP ) ( β=-0.01 ; 95 % CI : -0.03 , -0.00 ) . We observed a positive significant  association between free testosterone ( fT ) and fasting insulin  ( β=0.49 ; 95 % CI : 0.05 , 0.91 ) ; this association remained significant after adjustment for confounders . We also detected a  reverse association between  fT  and HDL-C  ( β=-0.41 ; 95 % CI :  -0.70  ,  -0.12 )  . There was a positive significant  association between A4 and TG  ( β=0.02 ; 95 % CI : 0.00 , 0.04 ) after adjustment for PCOS diagnosis criteria . We also found  significant negative associations between A4 , TC , and LDL-C. Dehydroepi and rosterone sulfate ( DHEAS )  had a  positive association with LDL-C  ( β=0.02 ; 95 % CI  : 0.001 , 0.03  ) and a reverse  significant association with HDL-C  ( β=-0.03 ; 95 % CI : -0.06 , -0.001 ) . This meta- analysis confirmed the associations of some and rogenic and metabolic parameters , indicating that measurement of these parameters may be useful for predicting metabolic risk in PCOS patients."

"yObjectives The aim of this study was to assess the current evidence for long-acting  β2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) fixed-dose combinations  ( FDCs ) in the treatment of  COPD .  Material s and methods A systematic literature search of  r and omized controlled trials published in English up to September 2017 of  LABA/LAMA FDCs vs LABA or LAMA or LABA/inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) FDCs  in COPD patients was  performed using PubMed , Embase , Scopus , and Google Scholar . Outcomes including  forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) , Transition Dyspnea Index ( TDI ) scores , St George 's Respiratory Question naire ( SGRQ ) scores , exacerbations , exercise tolerance ( endurance time [ ET ] ) , inspiratory capacity ( IC ) , and rescue medication use  were evaluated . Results In total ,  27 studies were included in the review .   LABA/LAMA  FDCs significantly  improved lung function ( FEV1 )  at 12 weeks compared with  LABA  or  LAMA  or  LABA/ICS  . These effects were maintained over time . Significant improvements with LABA/LAMA FDCs vs each evaluated comparator were also observed in  TDI and SGRQ scores  , even if significant differences between different LABA/LAMA FDCs were detected . Only the  LABA/LAMA  FDC  indacaterol/glycopyrronium  has shown superiority vs LAMA and LABA/ICS for  reducing exacerbation rates  , while olo  date rol/tiotropium and indacaterol/glycopyrronium  have been shown to  improve ET and IC  vs the active comparators  . Rescue medication use  was significantly reduced by LABA/LAMA FDCs vs the evaluated comparators . LABA/LAMA FDCs were  safe  , with no increase in  the risk of adverse events  with LABA/LAMA FDCs vs the monocomponents . Conclusion Evidence supporting the  efficacy  of LABA/LAMA FDCs for COPD is heterogeneous ,  particularly for TDI and SGRQ scores , exacerbation rates , ET , and IC  . So far ,  indacaterol/glycopyrronium  is the LABA/LAMA FDC that has the strongest evidence for superiority vs LABA , LAMA , and LABA/ICS FDCs across the evaluated outcomes . LABA/LAMA FDCs were safe ; however , more data should be collected in a real-world setting to confirm their safety."
"dBreast cancer is the most common cancer among  women .  The number of  breast cancer survivors  has increased due to screening and improved treatment methods , which makes it important to increase knowledge on their health and well-being .  Physical activity  has been reported to improve  quality of life , decrease fatigue and reduce all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality  in  breast cancer survivors .  The beneficial effects of  physical activity  may manifest themselves in circulating levels of insulin , insulin-growth factors ( IGFs ) I and II and their binding proteins ( IGFBPs ) , or inflammatory biomarkers . The aim of this report was to review available r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) on the effects of  physical activity  on biomarkers in breast cancer survivors . We identified  12 publications based on nine RCTs that  fulfilled our inclusion criteria published until 19th June 2012 . The  RCTs were small ( 16 - 101 breast cancer survivors ) ; mean BMI was ≥25 and the mean age in 8 out of 9 RCTs was approximately 50 years .  Five RCTs reported statistically significant  effects  of physical activity  on insulin , IGF-I , IGF-II and IGFBP-3  in breast cancer survivors , but the results were not consistent . None of four RCTs found any evidence for a role of investigated interleukines . One trial reported some evidence  that exercise   may decrease C-reactive protein levels  . In conclusion , available RCTs have produced some evidence  that physical activity  may result in beneficial  changes in levels of insulin , IGFs , IGFBPs , and inflammatory biomarkers  in breast cancer survivors . However , further larger RCTs on physical  activity  and biomarkers in breast cancer survivors are warranted."
"tAbstract The effectiveness of  biologic therapies  now means that remission or low  disease  activity are realistic targets for treatment . However , after achieving remission/low disease activity , the next steps remain unclear . The aim of this publication was to conduct a broad systematic literature review to evaluate dosing down of  biologics .  After screening papers and abstract s for relevance and application of inclusion /exclusion criteria , a structured extraction process was used to collect information on the included studies .  Fifty-two papers were included in the analysis across rheumatic disease .  In patients who discontinue  therapy  ,  remission  is not typically sustained , with reported  rates of relapse  and flare across early RA ( 48–54 % ) , established RA ( 2–84 % ) , axial spondyloarthritis ( 11–53 % ) and PsA ( 44.9 % ) . In many cases , an  acceptable disease activity  can be regained upon retreatment . More research is needed to underst and the long-term impacts of these strategies on efficacy , safety and cost."

" 1 , 2 and 3-year  overall survival  is incremented by the  IPC .  No differences have been found at  5-year  in  overall survival rate .  2 and 3-year  mortality rates  in patients with nodal invasion and 1 and 2-year  mortality rates  in patients with serosal infiltration are improved by the use of  IPC . IPC  has positive effect on  peritoneal recurrence  and  distant metastasis . Morbidity rate  is incremented by  IPC .  Loco-regional lymph-nodes invasion in patients affected by advanced gastric cancer is not a contraindication to IPC."
"eBackground : Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most deadly complication of all major chronic liver diseases . Since early detection is the most significant determinant of overall survival , intense screening is of major importance . Methods : This overview is based on a systematic review of the available literature on  HCC screening and surveillance  in the PubMed data base . Results : Over the last decades , major etiological risk factors were identified and the population at highest risk for the development of HCC was clearly defined .  Screening  in these patients has been repeatedly demonstrated to detect early tumor stages and to be cost-effective . Therefore ,  screening  is recommended by all current guidelines and usually comprises a bi-annual  ultrasound  examination in Western countries . In some Asian countries biomarkers are also used ; however , their efficiency for Western HCCs remains to be determined . The detection of  lesions  > 1 cm during routine screening requires subsequent confirmation of HCC . The diagnosis can be accurately established by modern imaging techniques , i.e. computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging , in the majority of patients . In ambiguous cases and if radiological criteria are not met by two imaging techniques , biopsies remain the gold st and ard for diagnosis . Furthermore ,  histology  is of key importance for the development of new diagnostic and predictive biomarkers . Conclusion :   Screening and detection algorithms   for  patients at risk for HCC  are  effective  and should be rigorously implemented in clinical routine."
"nBackground Early intervention with nutritional support has been found to stop  weight loss  in  older people malnourished or at risk of malnutrition .  Enriched food could be a more attractive alternative to improve meals , than conventional oral nutritional supplements . Aims To determine the effectiveness of  food-based fortification  to prevent risk of malnutrition in  elderly patients in community or institutionalized elderly patients .  Methods A systematic review was conducted of r and omized controlled trials , quasi-experimental , and interrupted time series including a longitudinal analysis . Participants  Elderly patients who are institutionalized , hospitalized or community-dwelling , with a minimum average age of 65 years . All type of patient groups , with the exception of people in critical care , or those who were recovering from cancer treatment , were included .  InterventionS tudies had to compare  food-based fortification  against alternatives . Studies that used  oral nutritional supplementation  such as  commercial sip feeds , vitamin or mineral supplements  were excluded . The search was conducted in Cochrane , CINAHL , PubMed , EMBASE , LILACS , and Cuiden . An independent peer review was carried out . Results From  1011 studies obtained , 7 were included for the systematic review , with 588 participants .  It was possible to perform meta- analysis of four studies that provided results on  caloric and protein intake .  Food-based fortification yielded positive  results  in the  total amount of ingested calories and protein .  Nevertheless , due to the small number of participants and the poor quality of some studies , further high quality studies are required to provide reliable evidence . Implication s for practice Despite the limited evidence , due to their simplicity , low cost , and positive results in  protein and calories  intake , simple dietary interventions based on the  food-based fortification or densification with protein or energy  of the st and ard diet could be considered in patients at risk of malnutrition."

"nBACKGROUND This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of  distraction  for reducing  infant  distress  during vaccinations in young children aged 0 to 3 years .  DESIGN / METHODS Data base search es identified relevant r and omized and quasi-r and omized controlled trials . Three separate clinical questions related to variants of the psychological strategy of  distraction ( directed video ; directed toy ; nondirected toy )  were pursued .  Distress  was identified as the critical outcome to assess the benefits of distraction and extracted from relevant trials .  Distress  was analyzed by phase of procedure ( distress preprocedure ; distress acute ; distress recovery ; idiosyncratic phases based on some or all of the 3 aforementioned phases ) . RESULTS  Ten studies were included  in the review . Significant results are presented herein . For  directed video distraction  , moderate quality evidence suggested that  distress  was lowered in the treatment group st and ardized mean difference ( SMD -0.68 lower [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , -1.04 to -0.32 ] ) for the acute+recovery phase as well as the preprocedure phase ( SMD -0.49 lower [ 95 % CI , -7.6 to -0.22 ] ) . For  directed toy distraction  , the analysis of low- quality evidence for a  combined preprocedure+acute+recovery phase of distress  ( analysis n=81 ) , suggested that  distress  was lowered in the treatment group ( SMD -0.47 lower [ 95 % CI , -0.91 to -0.02 ] ) . An effect for  nondirected toy distraction  was also seen , analyzing very-low- quality evidence , for the  acute distress phase  ( n=290 ; SMD -0.93 lower [ 95 % CI , -1.86 to 0.00 ] ) .  Generally low- quality to very-low- quality evidence suggests that there may be an effect of  directed ( toy and video ) and nondirected toy distraction  for  children aged 0 to 3 years  , for certain phases of the vaccination."
">Faster  weight gain  early in infancy may contribute to a greater risk of later  obesity in formula-fed compared to breast-fed infants .  One potential explanation for the difference in weight gain is higher  macronutrient intake  in  formula-fed infants  during the  first weeks of life  . A systematic review was conducted using Medline to assess the   macronutrient and energy content plus volume of intake   in  breast-fed and formula-fed infants in early infancy . All studies from healthy , term , singleton infants reporting values for the composition of breast milk during the first month of life were  included . The  energy content  of colostrum ( mean , SEM : 53.6 ± 2.5 kcal/100 mL ) , transitional milk ( 57.7 ± 4.2 kcal/100 mL ) , and mature milk ( 65.2 ± 1.1 kcal/100 mL ) was lower than  conventional infant formula  ( 67 kcal/100 mL ) on all days analyzed .  The protein concentration  of colostrum ( 2.5 ± 0.2 g/100 mL ) and transitional milk ( 1.7 ± 0.1 g/100 mL ) was higher than formula ( 1.4 g/100 mL ) , while the  protein  content of mature milk ( 1.3 ± 0.1 g/100 mL ) was slightly lower .  Formula-fed infants  consume a higher volume and more energy dense milk in early life leading to  faster growth  which could potentially program a  greater risk of long-term obesity ."
" Compared with non-automated weaning strategies , weaning  with SmartCare  ™  significantly decreased weaning time , time to successful extubation , ICU stay and proportions of patients receiving  ventilation for  longer than  seven days and 21 days . It also showed a favourable trend toward fewer patients receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days ; however the estimated effect was imprecise . Summary estimates from our review suggest that these benefits may be achieved without increasing  the risk of adverse events  , especially  reintubation ;  however , the quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate , and evidence was derived from 10 small r and omized controlled trials."
"sVaccine-induced  antibodies  may wane more quickly in  persons living with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV )  than in  healthy individuals .  We review ed the literature on vaccines routinely recommended in  HIV-infected patients  to estimate how seroprotection decreases over time in those who initially responded to immunization . For each study retrieved from the literature , the decrease of seroprotection was modeled with a log binomial generalized linear model , and data were pooled in a meta- analysis to provide estimates of seroprotection 2 and 5 years after the last vaccine administration . Our analyses confirmed that the  duration of seroprotection  was shorter in  HIV-infected patients  and that with current guidelines , a substantial proportion of patients would have lost  protective antibodies  before a booster was proposed . We therefore discuss the implication s for the monitoring of antibody levels and timing of revaccination in these patients."
">Background Up to 33 % of the general population  over 50 years of age  are affected by nocturnal leg cramps  .  Currently there are no generally accepted clinical characteristics , which identify nocturnal leg cramps . This study aims to identify these clinical characteristics and to differentiate between them and the characteristics of restless leg syndrome and periodic limb disorder . Method A systematic literature study was executed from December  2015  to May  2016  . This study comprised of a systematic literature review of r and omized clinical trials , observational studies on  nocturnal and rest  cramps of legs and other muscles , and other systematic and narrative review s. Two research ers independently extracted literature data and analyzed this using a st and ardized review ing protocol . Modified versions of the Cochrane Collaboration tools assessed the risk of bias . A Delphi study was conducted to assess agreement on the characteristics of  nocturnal leg cramps  . Results After systematic and manual search es , eight r and omized trials and ten observational studies were included . On the basis of these we identified seven diagnostic characteristics of  nocturnal leg cramps : intense pain , period of duration from seconds to maximum 10 minutes , location in calf or foot , location seldom in thigh or hamstrings , persistent subsequent pain , sleep disruption and distress .  Conclusion The seven above characteristics will enhance recognition of the condition , and help clinicians make a clear distinction between  NLC  and other  sleep-related musculoskeletal  disorder  among older adults ."
")Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is one of the main causes of mortality in  critically ill patients .  Injured lungs can be protected by optimum  mechanical ventilator  setting s , using low tidal volume ( VT ) values and higher positive-end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) ; the benefits of this protective strategy on outcomes have been confirmed in several prospect i ve r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . The question is whether healthy lungs need specific protective ventilatory setting s when they are at risk of injury . We performed a systematic review of the scientific literature and a meta- analysis regarding the rationale of applying  protective ventilatory strategies  in patients at risk of ARDS in the perioperative period and in the intensive care unit ( ICU )."
" AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Technical expertise to enable the delivery of high quality RT to complex target volumes as is required in gastric cancer , and surgical st and ards to ensure the delivery of high quality surgery , have matured in recent years . Six trials with large sample sizes are currently ongoing to better define the role of  preoperative CRT  ( two studies ) and  postoperative CRT  ( four studies ) , when used in conjunction with high quality  surgery  and  RT  , and contemporary CT regimens . The moderate likelihood of  locoregional recurrences  and the favorable  therapeutic  ratio with using RT preoperatively in other setting s , provide optimism that  preoperative CRT  would have a pivotal role to play in locally advanced  gastric cancer  . Active accrual into ongoing trials is strongly encouraged."
")Background  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT )  , a st and ard of care for  locally advanced breast cancer patients  , is widely used for  early breast cancer patients also .  The varying role of regimens used as  NACT  needs to be investigated . Despite availability of some r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , it is unclear which treatment regimen suits best . Further , there is no study comparing all the three regimens . Accordingly , present study will compare the efficacy of  anthracyclines , taxanes , and targeted therapy  administered in neoadjuvant setting on the basis of oncological outcomes and functional outcomes . Method / design Online data bases PubMed and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials will be search ed to acquire eligible studies . Further , content of relevant journals , references of relevant articles , and proceedings of major related conference will also be search ed . The RCTs comparing any of abovementioned regimen as  NACT  on  breast cancer patients will  be eligible . Two review ers independently and in duplicate will screen the records on the basis of title and abstract and complete full-text review to determine eligibility . Similarly , data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be done by two independent review ers . The pair-wise meta- analysis as well as network meta- analysis will be conducted to assess the  relative efficacy of anthracyclines , taxanes , and targeted therapy regimens .  Discussion The present systematic review will improve the underst and ing of the relative efficacies of the three treatment regimens and possibly guide the clinical practice s by providing the current best evidence on the efficacy of various regimens of  NACT  in the management of  breast cancer patients .

"DTumor  necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor ( TNFi ) treatment  is effective for  ulcerative colitis ( UC ) and Crohn ’s disease ( CD ) .  Although several meta-analyses have been performed to evaluate the association between  TNFi  treatment and  surgical morbidity  , the results are controversial . We conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of the prevention of  surgical site infection ( SSI )  after surgery for  UC and CD in patients on  TNFis   , based on literature published between January 2000 and May 2019 ( registered on PROSPERO , No. CRD42019134156 ) . Overall ,  2175 UC patients in 13 observational studies ( OBSs ) and 7084 CD patients in 16 OBSs were included .  The  incidences of incisional ( INC ) SSI and organ/space ( O/S ) SSI  after surgery for UC were 179/1985 ( 9.0 % ) and 176/2175 ( 8.1 % ) , respectively .  TNFi  use was not associated with the  incidences of INC SSI  ( odds ratio ( OR ) 1.04 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( 0.47–2.32 ) or  O/S SSI  ( OR 1.85 , 95 % CI ( 0.82–4.20 ) ) after surgery for UC .  The INC SSI and O/S SSI incidences  after surgery for CD were 289/3089 ( 9.4 % ) and 526/7,084 ( 7.4 % ) , respectively . Preoperative  TNFi  use was not associated  with INC SSI  ( OR 0.98 , 95 % CI ( 0.52–1.83 ) ) or  O/S SSI incidence  ( OR 1.09 , 95 % CI ( 0.78–1.52 ) ) after surgery for CD . We did not find a significant association between preoperative  TNFi   use  and  SSI  in surgery for UC or CD."
" Regular use of  ICS  at low or medium daily doses is associated with a  mean  reduction of 0.48 cm/y in  linear growth velocity  and a 0.61-cm change from baseline in  height  during a one-year treatment period in  children with mild to moderate persistent asthma .  The effect size of   ICS  on linear growth velocity  appears to be associated more strongly with the ICS molecule than with the device or dose ( low to medium dose range ) .   ICS-induced  growth suppression  seems to be maximal during the first year of therapy and less pronounced in subsequent years of treatment . However , additional studies are needed to better characterise the molecule dependency  of growth suppression  , particularly with newer molecules (  mometasone  ,  ciclesonide  ) , to specify the respective role of molecule , daily dose , inhalation device and patient age on the effect size of ICS , and to define the  growth suppression effect  of  ICS  treatment over a period of several years in  children  with  persistent asthma .  PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Do inhaled corticosteroids reduce  growth  in  children with persistent asthma  ? Review question : We review ed the evidence on whether  inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS )  could  affect growth  in  children with persistent asthma  , that is , a more severe asthma that requires regular use of medications for control of symptoms . BACKGROUND Treatment guidelines for asthma recommend  ICS  as first-line therapy for  children  with  persistent asthma .  Although  ICS  treatment is generally considered safe in children , parents and physicians always remain concerned about the potential negative effect of ICS on  growth .  Search date : We search ed trials published until January 2014 . Study characteristics : We included in this review trials comparing daily use of  corticosteroids  , delivered by any type of inhalation device for at least three months , versus  placebo or non-steroidal drugs  in  children up to 18 years of age with persistent asthma .  KEY RESULTS Twenty-five  trials involving 8471 children with mild to moderate persistent asthma ( 5128 treated with  ICS  and 3343 treated with  placebo or non-steroidal drugs )   were included in this review . Eighty percent of these trials were conducted in more than two different centres and were called multi-centre studies ; five were international multi-centre studies conducted in  high-income and low-income  countries across  Africa  ,  Asia-Pacifica  ,  Europe and the Americas  . Sixty-eight percent were financially supported by pharmaceutical companies . Meta- analysis ( a statistical technique that combines the results of several studies and provides a high level of evidence ) suggests that  children treated daily with  ICS   may grow approximately half a centimeter per year less than those not treated with these medications during the first year of treatment . The magnitude of  ICS-related   growth reduction  may depend on the type of drug .  Growth reduction  seems to be maximal during the first year of therapy and less pronounced in subsequent years of treatment . Evidence provided by this review allows us to conclude that daily use of  ICS  can cause a small  reduction in height  in  children up to 18 years of age with persistent asthma ;  this effect seems minor compared with the known benefit of these medications for asthma control . QUALITY OF EVIDENCE Eleven of 25 trials did not report how they guaranteed that participants had an equal chance of receiving  ICS  or  placebo  or  non-steroidal drugs .  All but six trials did not report how research ers were kept unaware of the treatment assignment list . However , this method ological limitation may not significantly affect the  quality of  evidence because the results remained almost unchanged when we excluded these trials from the analysis."
 : This first-ever meta- analysis of the kinematic differences between  people with stroke and healthy adults performing reach-to-target  found statistically significant differences for 21 of the 26 comparisons . The differences identified and values provided are potential foci for tailored rehabilitation interventions to improve upper limb recovery after stroke.
" From the patient perspective , our results support current season vaccination regardless of prior season vaccination . We found no overall evidence that prior season vaccination negatively impacts current  season  VE . It is important that future VE studies include vaccination history over multiple seasons in order to evaluate repeated vaccination in more detail."
"sAmino acid profile is a key aspect of  human milk ( HM )  protein quality . We report a systematic review of   total amino acid ( TAA )  and  free amino acid ( FAA ) profiles   , in  term and preterm HM derived from 13 and 19 countries , respectively .  Of the  83 studies that were critically review ed , 26 studies with 3774 subjects were summarized for  TAA  profiles  ,  while 22 studies with 4747 subjects were review ed for FAA .  Effects of gestational age , lactation stage , and geographical region were analyzed by Analysis of Variance . Data on  total nitrogen ( TN ) and TAA composition  revealed general inter- study consistency , whereas  FAA  concentrations varied among studies .  TN and all TAA declined  in the first two months of lactation and then remained relatively unchanged . In contrast , the  FAA glutamic acid and glutamine  increased , peaked around three to six months , and then declined . Some significant differences were observed for TAA  and FAA  , based on gestational age and region . Most regional TAA and FAA data were derived from Asia and Europe , while information from Africa was scant . This systematic review represents a useful evaluation of the amino acid composition of  human milk  , which is valuable for the assessment of protein quality of breast milk substitutes."

"ePost-hepatectomy  liver  failure contributes significantly to postoperative mortality after  liver resection .  The prediction of the individual risk for liver failure is challenging . This review aim ed to provide an overview of cytokine and growth factor triggered signaling pathways involved in liver regeneration after resection . MEDLINE and  Cochrane  data bases were search ed without language restrictions for articles from the time of inception of the data bases till March 2019 . All studies with comparative data on the effect of cytokines and growth factors on liver regeneration in  animals and humans  were included .  Overall 3.353 articles comprising 40 studies involving 1.498 patients and 101 animal studies were identified and met the inclusion criteria .  All included trials on humans were retrospective cohort/observational studies . There was substantial heterogeneity across all included studies with respect to the analyzed cytokines and growth factors and the described endpoints . High-level evidence on  serial measurements of growth factors and cytokines in blood sample s  used to predict liver regeneration after resection is still lacking . To address the heterogeneity of patients and potential markers , high throughput serial analyses may offer a method to predict an individual ’s  regenerative  potential in the future."
"aBACKGROUND The effectiveness of  chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery ( CRTS )  in  patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma  remains controversial . We performed a systematic review of the literature with meta- analysis . METHODS Electronic data bases were used to identify published studies  between January 1992 and April 2012 .  Pooled relative risk ( RR ) with 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) was utilized to estimate the strength of the association between  CRTS  and  surgery alone  ( SA ) survival of the  resectable esophageal carcinoma patients .  Heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed in the present study . RESULTS The final analysis of  2755 resectable esophageal carcinoma cases from 21 r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) are presented  . Compared to the SA group ,  the 1 , 3- and 5-year survival rates  were significantly higher in the CRTS group ( all P < 0.05 ) ; the 3-  and  5-year  survival  rates for the Eastern patients , Western patients , patients undergoing concurrent  chemoradiotherapy  , patients with squamous cell carcinoma , patients undergoing  High-dose radiotherapy  ( ≥ 40 Gy ) , and patients given either  "" cisplatin + Fluorouracil "" or "" cisplatin + paclitaxel "" chemotherapy  were significantly higher in the CRTS group ( all P < 0.05 ) . There were no statistical significance s  in the 3- and 5-year survival rates  for  patients undergoing sequential chemoradiotherapy  or  patients with  adenocarcinoma between the two groups ( all P > 0.05 ) . Compared to the RCTS group ,  the surgery rate  in the SA group was higher ( P < 0.05 ) , while the CRTS group had  significantly higher radical resection rate , R0 resection rate and lower postoperative local recurrence rate  ( all P < 0.05 ) .  The differences in postoperative complication incidence , post-operative distant metastasis and postoperative mortality rate  were not statistically significant between the two groups ( all P > 0.05 ) .  CRTS can significantly improve the survival and surgical conditions of patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma."
" The  inactivated influenza vaccine  has been proven effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza among  healthy adults ( 16 - 65 years ) and children ( ≥6 years )  ( GRADE A evidence ) . However , there is strikingly limited good- quality evidence ( all GRADE B , C or not existing ) of the effectiveness of influenza vaccination  on complications such as pneumonia , hospitalisation and influenza-specific and overall mortality .  Inconsistent results are found in studies among  children younger than 6 years , individuals with COPD , institutionalised elderly ( 65 years or older ) , elderly with co-morbidities and healthcare workers in elderly homes  , which can only be explained by bias of unknown origin . The vaccination of pregnant women might be beneficial for their newborns , and vaccination of children might be protective in non-recipients of the vaccine of all ages living in the same community ( one RCT , Grade B evidence )."
" For  ICU patients without ALI or ARDS  , strategy C ( lower VT + higher PEEP ) was associated with the  highest PaO2/FiO2 ratio .  Strategy B ( higher VT + lower PEEP ) was superior to the other strategies in  improving pulmonary compliance .  Strategy A ( lower VT + lower PEEP ) was associated with a  shorter length of ICU stay  , whereas strategy D ( lower VT + ZEEP ) was associated with the lowest PaO2/FiO2 ratio and pulmonary compliance."
"gAbstract The purpose of the present review was to determine whether the use of  postoperative adjuvant systemic therapy  in  patients with completely resected non – small‐cell lung cancer ( NSCLC )   improves survival .  Cancer Care Ontario 's Program in Evidence ‐Based Care review ed the evidence to up date previously published recommendations for  patients with completely resected NSCLC .  Relevant studies were identified from a systematic MEDLINE , EMBASE , and Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s search of studies published from  2010 to 2016  . All phase III r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and relevant systematic review s were included .  Data on overall survival ( OS ) , disease‐free survival , adverse events , and quality of life  were extracted from each of the studies . Two relevant systematic review s , 13 RCTs , and a series of pooled analyses by Lung  Adjuvant Cisplatin  Evaluation‐Biomarker were included in the present review .  Adjuvant chemotherapy  statistically significantly  improved OS  for resected stage II‐IIIA NSCLC and is recommended . For  patients with stage IB NSCLC  , no significant improvement was seen  in OS ;  however , the results from subgroup analyses indicate that it would be reasonable to  consider adjuvant chemotherapy  for patients with larger tumors ( ≥ 4 cm ) . The present data do not support the use  of adjuvant novel therapies  ( ie , epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor  , bevacizumab  ,  and immunotherapy )  either as an addition to , or instead of  , cytotoxic chemotherapy .  No predictive biomarkers are available to select patients more likely to  benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy . Cytotoxic chemotherapy  remains the st and ard of care as adjuvant  therapy  for patients with resected stage II‐IIIA NSCLC . Additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate targeted agents in molecularly defined subgroups before these agents can be recommended in the adjuvant setting."

"sPurpose : To identify , describe and discuss the parameters used to predict  weaning from  mechanical ventilation  and extubation outcomes .  Methods : Systematic review of scientific articles using four electronic data bases : PubMed , Embase , PEDro and Cochrane Library . Search terms included  “ weaning ”  ,  “ extubation ”  ,  “ withdrawal ”  and  “ discontinuation  ” , combined with  “ mechanical ventilation ”  and “ predictive factors ” , “ predictive parameters ” and “ predictors for success ” . In this study , we included original articles that presented predictive factors for weaning or extubation  outcomes in adult patients  and  not restricted  to a single disease .  Articles not written in English  were excluded . Results :  A total of 43 articles were included , with a total of 7929 patients and 56 different parameters related  to weaning and extubation  outcomes  .  Rapid Shallow Breathing Index ( RSBI )  was the most common predictor , discussed  in 15 studies ( 2159 patients )  , followed by Age and Maximum Inspiratory Pressure in seven studies . The other 53 parameters were found in less than six studies . Conclusion : There are several parameters used to predict weaning and extubation outcomes .  RSBI  was the most frequently studied and seems to be an important measurement tool in deciding whether to wean/extubate a  patient .  Furthermore , the results demonstrated that weaning and extubation should be guided by several parameters , and not only to respiratory ones."
"yThe introduction of  minimally invasive surgery  in other gynecologic cancers has shown benefits with similar  oncologic  outcomes . However , the biology and complexity of surgery for ovarian cancer may preclude this approach for  ovarian cancer patients .  Our objective is to assess feasibility to achieve  complete  cytoreductive surgery after  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  for  stage IIIC – IV ovarian cancer patients  via   minimally  invasive surgery .  Our data sources include PubMed , Embase , Scopus , Biosis , Clinical trials.gov , and the Cochrane Library . Meta- analysis was performed using the r and om-effects model with DerSimonian and Laird estimator for the amount of heterogeneity to estimate the pooled outcomes . A funnel plot and Egger ’s regression test were used to test publication bias . The  Newcastle – Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale  was used to assess the quality of the studies . There were  6 studies ( 3 prospect i  ve ,  3  retrospective  ) that met the criteria for meta- analysis with a total of 3231 patients , 567 were in the minimally invasive group and 2664 in the laparotomy group .  Both groups were similar in stage and serous histology .  Complete cytoreductive surgery  was achieved in 74.50 % ( 95 % CI 40.41–97.65 % ) and 53.10 % ( 95 % CI 4.88–97.75 % ) of patients in the minimally invasive and laparotomy groups , respectively . There was no statistical significant difference between these 2 pooled proportions ( p = 0.52 ) . Three studies compared  minimally invasive surgery  vs  laparotomy .  No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in  obtaining complete cytoreductive surgery  [ OR = 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.70–1.16 ; p = 0.43 ) ] . A symmetrical funnel plot indicated no publication bias .  The pooled proportion for grade > 2 postoperative complications  was not significant among the laparoscopy group [ 3.11 % ( 95 % CI 0.00–10.24 % ; p = 0.15 ) ] .  Complete cytoreductive surgery appears feasible and safe  with  minimally invasive surgery  in selected advanced ovarian cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
"sBACKGROUND Numerous r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) have arrived at conflicting conclusions on  expressive writing ( EW )  as an intervention for  breast cancer ( BC ) patients  , but there has been no meta- analysis of these studies to assess the effectiveness of  EW  in BC population . METHODS PubMed , Web of Science , The Cochrane Library , EMBASE , and CINAHL and the www . clinical trial.gov data base on ongoing clinical trials were search ed to identify all the RCTs investigating efficacy of  EW  on  the physical and psychological health in BC patients .  The risk of bias of the original studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration 's tool . Our primary outcomes for physical and psychological health were respectively  negative somatic symptoms and negative mood  which were stratified by emotional , benefit-finding and multiple prompts in sub-group analyses . The data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.2 and Stata version 12.0 statistical software . RESULTS Of  the 5,232 titles screened , we identified 11 RCTs with a total of 1,178 participants .  The pooled results showed a significant  effect of EW  using either an emotional prompt or a benefit-finding prompt on  reducing negative somatic symptoms  in BC patients in the ≤3-month follow-up group [ Mean Difference ( MD ) , -13.03 , 95 % CI , -19.23 to -6.83 , P<0.0001 ; MD , -9.18 , 95 % CI , -15.57 to -2.79 , P = 0.005 ] . There was  no significant  effect of EW  on physical health  in the > 3-month follow-up group . There were no significant differences  regarding psychological health indexes   between EW  intervention and control groups at any of the follow-up time-points ( P>0.05 ) .  This systematic review and meta- analysis  reveals that EW intervention  may have a significantly positive  impact  on  the  physical health but not the psychological  health in BC patients  , but this benefit may not last long . However , further high- quality studies with more homogeneity are needed to confirm the current findings."
"sAscites is a major complication of cirrhosis,1 occurring in 50 % of patients over 10 years of follow up.2 The development of ascites is an important l and mark in the natural history of cirrhosis as it is associated with a 50 % mortality over two years,2–5 and signifies the need to consider  liver transplantation  as a therapeutic option.3 The majority ( 75 % ) of patients who  present with ascites  have  underlying cirrhosis  , with the remainder being due to  malignancy  ( 10 %  )  ,  heart failure  ( 3 %  )  , tuberculosis ( 2 % ) , pancreatitis ( 1 % ) , and other rare causes.6 The true prevalence and incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and its complications in the UK are unknown .  Mortality from cirrhosis  has increased from 6 per 100 000 population in 1993 to 12.7 per 100 000 population in 2000.7 Approximately 4 % of the general population have abnormal  liver function or liver disease8  and approximately 10–20 % of those with one of the three most common chronic liver diseases ( non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , alcoholic liver disease , and chronic hepatitis C ) develop  cirrhosis  over a period of 10–20 years . With a rising frequency of alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , a huge increase in the burden  of  liver disease is expected over the next few years8 with an inevitable increase in the  complications of cirrhosis .  There have been several changes in the clinical management of  cirrhotic ascites  over recent years , and the purpose of these guidelines is to promote a consistent clinical practice throughout the UK . These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search , including the results of r and omised control trials , systematic review s , prospect i ve retrospective studies and , in some instances , evidence obtained from expert committee reports . Where possible a judgement is made on the quality of the information used to generate the guidelines , and the specific recommendations."

FINDINGS 10 RCTs and 2 observational studies were included .  Children with serum levels between 10 - 20mg/l  did not have a  reduction in duration of symptoms , length of hospital stay or need for mechanical ventilation or better spirometric results  compared with levels<10mg/l . Levels above 20mg/l are not associated with higher  rates of adverse effects .  This study is limited due to heterogeneity in the way theophylline levels were reported and poor surveillance of adverse effects across studies .  Dosing strategies aim ing for levels between 10 - 20mg/l are not associated with better outcomes . Clinicians should rely on clinical outcomes and not serum levels when using intravenous  theophyllines  in children suffering an acute exacerbation of asthma."
"sBackground Cholera is an acute watery diarrhoea caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae , which if severe can cause rapid dehydration and death . Effective management requires early diagnosis and rehydration using oral rehydration salts or intravenous fluids . In this review , we evaluate the additional benefits of treating cholera with  antimicrobial drugs .  Objectives To quantify the benefit of  antimicrobial treatment  for  patients with cholera  , and determine whether there are differences between classes of antimicrobials or dosing schedules . Search methods We search ed the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register ; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) ; PubMed ; EMBASE ; African Index Medicus ; LILACS ; Science Citation Index ; metaRegister of Controlled Trials ; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ; conference proceedings ; and reference lists to March 2014 . Selection criteria R and omized and quasi‐r and omized controlled clinical trials  in adults and children with cholera  that compared : 1 ) any  antimicrobial treatment with placebo or no treatment  ; 2 )  different antimicrobials  head‐to‐head ; or 3 ) different  dosing  schedules or different duration s of  treatment with  the same  antimicrobial  . Data collection and analysis Two review ers independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria , and extracted data from included trials  . Diarrhoea duration and stool volume  were defined as primary outcomes . We calculated mean difference ( MD ) or ratio of means ( ROM ) for continuous outcomes , with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) , and pooled data using a r and om‐effects meta‐ analysis . The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach . Main results  Thirty‐nine trials were included in this review with 4623 participants .  Antimicrobials versus  placebo  or no treatment Overall , antimicrobial therapy  shortened the mean duration of diarrhoea  by about a day and a half compared  to  placebo or no treatment ( MD ‐36.77 hours , 95 % CI ‐43.51 to ‐30.03 , 19 trials , 1013 participants , moderate quality evidence ) . Antimicrobial therapy also  reduced the total stool volume  by 50 % ( ROM 0.5 , 95 % CI 0.45 to 0.56 , 18 trials , 1042 participants , moderate quality evidence ) and  reduced the amount of rehydration fluids  required by 40 % ( ROM 0.60 , 95 % CI 0.53 to 0.68 , 11 trials , 1201  participants  ,  moderate quality evidence ) . The mean duration of fecal excretion of vibrios  was reduced by almost three days ( MD 2.74 days , 95 % CI ‐3.07 to ‐2.40 ,  12 trials , 740 participants ,   moderate  quality evidence ) . There was substantial heterogeneity in the size of these benefits , probably due to differences in the antibiotic used , the trial methods ( particularly effective r and omization ) , and the timing of outcome assessment . The benefits of antibiotics were seen both in trials recruiting  only patients with severe dehydration  and in those  recruiting patients with mixed levels of dehydration .  Comparisons of antimicrobials In head‐to‐head comparisons , there were no differences detected  in diarrhoea duration or stool volume  for  tetracycline  compared  to doxycycline  (  three trials , 230 participants  , very low quality evidence ) ; or  tetracycline  compared to  ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin  (  three trials ,  259 participants , moderate quality evidence ) . In indirect comparisons with substantially more trials ,  tetracycline  appeared to have larger benefits than  doxycycline , norfloxacin and trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole  for the primary review outcomes . Single dose  azithromycin   shortened the duration of diarrhoea  by over a day compared to  ciprofloxacin  ( MD ‐32.43 , 95 % CI ‐62.90 to ‐1.95 , two trials , 375 participants , moderate quality evidence ) and by half a day compared to  erythromycin  ( MD ‐12.05 , 95 % CI ‐22.02 to ‐2.08 , two trials , 179 participants , moderate quality evidence ) . It was not compared with  tetracycline  . Authors ' conclusions In treating cholera , antimicrobials result in substantial improvements in clinical and microbiological outcomes , with similar effects observed in severely and non‐severely ill patients .  Azithromycin and tetracycline  may have some advantages over other antibiotics."
" Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD  ( reduced rate of exacerbations , reduced rate of decline in quality of life and possibly reduced rate of decline in FEV(1 ) )  against the potential side effects  ( oropharyngeal c and idiasis and hoarseness , and risk of pneumonia ) ."
 New trials are currently being conducted that may revolutionize MIBC treatment preceding or following cystectomy . Head-to-head phase III trials of  perioperative chemotherapy  and further phase II and phase III trials of targeted therapy and other therapeutic approaches are necessary before the current  cisplatin-based perioperative chemotherapy  paradigm is altered.
"gThe objective of this study was to review the evidence about what factors influence   user engagement  in   Internet-based behavioral interventions   for chronic illness .  We conducted a systematic review of the recent published literature . Search es of MEDLINE ( using Ovid and PubMed ) , The Cochrane Library , and PsycINFO , from January 2000 to December 2008 , were completed . Additional articles were identified from search ing the bibliographies of retrieved articles . We identified studies of  interactive health communication interventions  delivered via the  Internet  that , apart from delivering health information , had another component such as interactive tools to manage illness , decision support for treatment , or social support .  We restricted the age range to adulthood .  The search identified  186 abstract s ; 46 articles were review ed .  We used a qualitative approach called "" positive deviance "" to study those interventions that have succeeded in engaging users where most have failed . Some ways to improve  user engagement  in  Internet interventions  suggested by our review include addressing  health concerns  that are important and relevant to an individual patient or consumer and an individualized approach , such as personally tailored advice and feedback . Interventions that are part of larger health management programs that include clinicians appear to be especially promising."
"eABSTRACT Previous studies have shown that  fish consumption  and dietary intake of  n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  (  n-3 PUFAs  ) are associated with  hip fracture ;  however , findings were conflicting . The present review aim ed to summarize the current evidence on the association of  fish consumption  and dietary  intake  of  n-3 PUFAs  with  hip fracture .  The online data bases of PubMed , ISI Web of Science , Scopus , ProQuest , Science Direct and Embase were search ed until August 2017 for related publications using relevant keywords . To pool data , either a fixed-effects model or r and om-effects models were used . Cochran 's Q tests were used to assess heterogeneity between studies . In total ,  10 studies ( 7 prospect i ve and 3 case-control studies ) were included in  this systematic  review  , and  9 studies with total sample size of 292657 participants were included in the meta- analysis . The age of participants was 20 years or older .  Combining 8 effect sizes from 4 prospect i ve studies and 2 case-control studies revealed a significant inverse  association between fish consumption and risk of hip fracture  ( pooled effect size : 0.88 , 95 % CI : 0.79 - 0.98 , P = 0.02 ) . Although this relationship became non-significant in prospect i ve studies , a significant inverse association was found in prospect i ve studies with sample size of 10000 individuals or more , and studies that considered  body mass index  as a covariate . Furthermore ,  dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs  was inversely associated with  risk of hip fracture  ( pooled effect size : 0.89 , 95 % CI : 0.80 - 0.99 , P = 0.02 ) . Also , such relationship was seen after excluding one case-control study and combining effect sizes only from prospect i ve studies ( pooled effect size : 0.88 , 95 % CI : 0.80 - 0.98 , P = 0.02 ) . In conclusion , we found that fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs might have  protective effects on bone health  and decline the risk of hip fracture."
")Unhealthy alcohol use involves a spectrum from hazardous use ( exceeding guidelines but no harms ) through to alcohol dependence .  Evidence -based  management of unhealthy alcohol use in primary health care has been recommended since 1979 . However , sustained and systematic implementation has proven challenging . The  Continuing Quality Improvement ( CQI ) process  is design ed to enable services to detect barriers , then devise and implement changes , result ing in service improvements . We conducted a systematic review of literature reporting on strategies to improve implementation of  screening and interventions  for  unhealthy alcohol use in primary care  ( MEDLINE EMBASE , PsycINFO , CINAHL , the Australian Indigenous Health InfoNet ) . Additional inclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) pragmatic setting ; ( 2 ) reporting original data ; ( 3 ) quantitative outcomes related to provision of service or change in practice . We investigate the extent to which the three essential elements of  CQI  are being used ( data -guided activities , considering local conditions ; iterative development ) . We compare characteristics of programs that include these three elements with those that do not . We describe the  types , organizational levels  ( e.g. health service , practice , clinician  ) , duration of strategies , and their outcomes .   Fifty-six papers representing 45 projects were included .  Of these , 24 papers were r and  omized  controlled trials , 12 controlled studies and 20 before/after and other design s. Most reported on strategies for improving implementation of  screening and brief intervention .  Only six addressed  relapse prevention pharmacotherapies .  Only five reported on  patient outcomes  and none showed significant improvement . The three essential CQI elements were clearly identifiable in 12 reports . More studies with three essential CQI elements had  implementation and follow-up duration  s above the median ; utilised multifaceted design s ; targeted both practice and health system levels ; improved screening and brief intervention than studies without the CQI elements . Utilizing  CQI  methods in implementation research would appear to be well-suited to drive improvements in service delivery for unhealthy alcohol use . However , the body of literature describing such studies is still small . More well- design ed research , including hybrid studies of both implementation and patient outcomes , will be needed to draw clearer conclusions on the optimal approach for implementing screening and treatment for unhealthy alcohol use .

"eMetabolic syndrome ( MS ) is characterised by accumulation of CVD risk factors . The use of  very long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( VLC n3 PUFA )  could potentially benefit MS by reducing risk factors . To better underst and the possible VLC  n3 PUFA  benefits , the literature was systematic ally review ed for r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) that published effects of  VLC n3 PUFA  on  MS patients . 17 RCT  fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analysed for relevance to the research question . The available RCT convincingly show that the administration of  VLC n3 PUFA  doses > 1 g for at least 3 months produces a  significant reduction of triglycerides  ranging from 7 % to 25 % . These results confirm the  hypotriglyceridemic effect  of VLC n3 PUFA in MS patients . The  triglyceride lowering  may produce further benefits by reducing  the % of pro-atherogenic small dense LDL particles ( sdLDL )  and also perhaps by  ameliorating the inflammatory process associated with MS .  High doses  of VLC n3 PUFA  ( ≥ 3 g/day ) may  produce further TAG reductions but could raise other risk factors such as LDL-C.  No clear effects were found on  other MS markers .   The combination of VLC n3 PUFA plus a statin  may be useful to  prevent the occurrence of coronary events .  More studies are needed using different amounts of VLC  n3 PUFA  , time lengths , dietary background s and different profiles of  MS patients  before clear recommendations can be made."
 Problems with reporting  quality  impedes meaningful interpretation and cross- study comparisons . Inconsistent and misapplied terminology also create barriers to interprofessional communication and translation of findings to patient care . Improved reporting quality and creation of shared language will advance scientific rigor and clinical relevance of music intervention research.
"sAIM Because type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is related to obesity , it is often associated with  obstructive  sleep apnoea  syndrome  ( OSAS ) , although OSAS is also frequently diagnosed in  patients with type 1 diabetes ( T1D )  and may promote gestational diabetes . Thus , this systematic review of the scientific evidence aim ed to evaluate the epidemiological association between OSAS and all forms of diabetes , the current underst and ing of the pathophysiological mechanisms behind these associations , the expected benefits and limitations of  OSAS  treatment in  patients with diabetes  and , finally , to propose which patients require screening for OSAS . METHODS A panel comprising  French expert endocrinologists and pneumologists  was convened . Two of these experts made a search of the relevant literature for each subpart of the present report ; all panel experts then critically review ed the entire report separately as well as collectively . RESULTS There is little evidence to support the notion that   OSAS  treatment improves glycated haemoglobin  , although it may  improve nighttime blood glucose control and insulin sensitivity .  However , there is robust evidence that   OSAS  treatment lowers 24-h blood pressure .   The high prevalence of  OSAS  in  patients with T1D and T2D  justifies screening for the syndrome , which should be based on clinical symptoms , as the benefits of  OSAS  treatment are mainly improvement of symptoms related to  sleep apnoea .  There are also several clinical situations wherein screening for  OSAS  seems justified in patients with diabetes even when they have no symptoms , particularly to optimalize control of  blood pressure  in cases of resistant hypertension and microvascular complications."
"dInfluenza  vaccination programmes  are assumed to have a herd effect and protect contacts of  vaccinated persons  from influenza virus infection . We search ed MEDLINE , EMBASE , the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) , Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) from inception to March 2014 for studies assessing the  protective effect  of  influenza vaccination  vs  no vaccination  on influenza virus infections in contacts . We calculated odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence  intervals  ( CIs ) using a r and om-effects model . Of  43,082 screened articles , nine r and omised controlled  trials  (  RCTs ) and four  observational studies  were eligible . Among the RCTs , no statistically  significant herd effect on the occurrence of influenza in contacts  could be found ( OR : 0.62 ; 95 % CI : 0.34 - 1.12 ) . The one RCT conducted in a community setting , however , showed a significant effect ( OR : 0.39 ; 95 % CI : 0.26 - 0.57 ) , as did the observational studies ( OR : 0.57 ; 95 % CI : 0.43 - 0.77 ) . We found only a few studies that quantified the  herd effect of vaccination  , all studies except one were conducted in  children  , and the overall evidence was grade d as low . The evidence is too limited to conclude in what setting ( s ) a herd effect may or may not be achieved."
"eThe purpose of this review was to compare the  efficacy and safety  of  synthetic bone graft substitutes versus autograft or allograft  for the treatment of  lumbar and cervical spinal degenerative diseases .  Multiple major medical reference data bases were search ed for studies that evaluated spinal fusion using  synthetic bone graft substitutes ( either alone or with an autograft or allograft ) compared with autograft and allograft .  R and  omized  controlled trials ( RCT  ) and cohort studies with more than 10 patients were included .   Radiographic fusion , patient-reported outcomes , and functional outcomes  were the primary outcomes of interest . The search  yielded 214 citations with 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria .  For the  patients with lumbar spinal degenerative disease  , data from 19 comparative studies were included : 3 RCTs , 12 prospect i ve , and 4 retrospective studies .  Hydroxyapatite ( HA ) , HA+collagen , β-tricalcium phosphate ( β-TCP ) , calcium sulfate , or polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA )  were used . Overall , there were no differences between the treatment groups in terms  of fusion , functional outcomes , or complications  , except in 1 study that found higher rates of HA graft absorption . For the  patients with cervical degenerative conditions  , data from 8 comparative studies were included : 4 RCTs and 4 cohort studies ( 1 prospect i ve and 3 retrospective studies ) .  Synthetic grafts included HA , β-TCP/HA , PMMA , and biocompatible osteoconductive polymer ( BOP ) .  The PMMA and BOP grafts led to  lower fusion rates  , and PMMA , HA , and BOP had  greater risks of graft fragmentation , settling , and instrumentation problems  compared with iliac crest bone graft . The overall quality of evidence evaluating the potential use and superiority of the  synthetic biological material s  for lumbar and cervical fusion in this systematic review was low or insufficient , largely due to the high potential for bias and small sample sizes . Thus , definitive conclusions or recommendations regarding the use of these  synthetic material s  should be made cautiously and within the context of the limitations of the evidence."
"dOBJECTIVE Assessment of the available evidence regarding the effect of  augmented  feedback   on  motor function  of the upper extremity in  rehabilitation patients .  METHODS A systematic literature search was performed to identify  r and omized  controlled trials that evaluated the effect of  augmented feedback  on  motor function .  Two review ers systematic ally assessed the method ological quality of the trials . The reported effects were examined to evaluate the effect of therapeutic interventions using  augmented feedback  and to identify a possible relationship with patient characteristics , type of intervention , or method ological quality . RESULTS  Twenty-six r and omized controlled trials were included  , 9 of which reported a positive effect on  arm function tests .  Follow-up measurements were performed in 8 trials , 1 of which reported a positive effect . Different therapeutic interventions using  augmented feedback  , i.e. electromyographic  biofeedback  ,  kinetic feedback  ,  kinematic feedback  , or  knowledge of results  , show no difference in effectiveness  .   No firm evidence was found of effectiveness regarding the use of  augmented feedback  to improve  motor function  of the upper extremity in  rehabilitation patients .  Future studies should focus more on the content , form and timing of  augmented feedback  concerning the therapeutic intervention . It should be emphasized that motor learning effects can only be determined by re-examining the population after a follow-up period."
"dOBJECTIVE R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating various  lung-protective ventilation  modes or strategies in  newborn infants  have failed to show clear differences in  mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia .  This review tries to identify possible reasons for this observation , applying modern concepts on ventilator-induced lung injury and lung-protective ventilation . DATA SOURCE Published RCTs and systematic review s on  mechanical ventilation in newborn infants  were identified by search ing PubMed and the Cochrane Library . DATA SYNTHESIS A total of  16 RCTs  and four systematic review s comparing  high-frequency ventilation with conventional mechanical ventilation ( CMV )  failed to show consistent differences in  mortality and bronchopulmonary dysplasia .  Unfortunately , clear information or data on ventilation and oxygenation targets in the search for optimal lung volumes during  high-frequency ventilation or CMV  is lacking in many RCTs , question ing the validity of the results and the meta-analytic subgroup analysis . Based on improvement in oxygenation , only three RCTs successfully applied the optimal lung volume strategy during high-frequency ventilation . A total of 24 RCTs and three systematic review s comparing various  CMV  modes and setting s and two RCTs investigating permissive hypercapnia reported no differences in  mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia .  However , the intervention arms in these RCTs did not differ in  tidal volume or positive end-expiratory pressures  , variables that are considered important determinants in ventilator-induced lung injury . In fact , no RCT in  newborn infants  has substantiated so far the experimental finding that avoiding large  tidal volumes  and low  positive end-expiratory pressure  during  CMV  is lung protective in  newborn infants .   RCTs investigating lung-protective ventilation in  neonates  have mainly focused on comparing  high-frequency ventilation  with  CMV .  Most of these RCTs show weaknesses in the design , which may explain the inconsistent effect of high-frequency ventilation on bronchopulmonary dysplasia . RCTs on  CMV  only focused on comparing various modes and setting s , leaving the important question whether reducing  tidal volume  or increasing  positive end-expiratory pressure  is also lung protective in  newborn infants  unanswered."
  INO  can not be recommended  for patients with AHRF .   INO  results in a  transient improvement in oxygenation  but does not  reduce mortality  and may be harmful.
"dBACKGROUND There are still many unresolved questions in the management of  locally advanced Head and Neck Cancer ( HNC ) .  Many  chemotherapeutic drugs  and  radiotherapy  fractionation schemes are available and not all have been evaluated in head-to-head clinical trials . This systematic review and Bayesian network meta- analysis aims to compare the available treatment strategies and  chemotherapeutic  options for locally advanced HNC . METHODS We performed a search on bibliography data bases , trials registries and meetings proceedings for published and unpublished r  and omized trials from January 1st 2000 to December 1st 2017 .  Trials had to compare  systemic interventions and radiotherapy ( RT ) approaches  for  locally advanced , non-metastatic HNC . Trials recruiting patients whose surgery was the first treatment option , sample size less than 20 per arm or that did not use r and omization for treatment allocation  were excluded from the analysis . Summary estimates on  Overall survival ( OS ) , Progression-free survival ( PFS ) and toxicity outcomes  ( grade 3 - 4 mucositis and neutropenia ) were extracted from the included studies on a predefined data base sheet . Bias was assessed through the Chocrane  risk of bias assessment tool  . We performed a set of pair-wise meta-analyses using a r and om effect model . We also performed a r and om effect network meta- analysis under a Bayesian framework . FINDINGS From the  57 included trials , including 15,723 patients  , was possible to conduct analysis on 26 treatments for OS , 22 treatments for  PFS  and 10 treatments for  toxicity .  In terms of  OS  Concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) with  cisplatin  ( HR 0.70 , 95 % CrI [ credible interval ] 0.62 - 0.78 ) and cetuximab on top of CCRT ( HR 0.7 , 95 % CrI 0.5 - 0.97 ) are clearly superior to conventional RT alone .  Induction chemotherapy ( IC )  with  cisplatin and fluorouracil  ( HR 0.74 , 95 % CrI 0.52 - 0.95 ) , IC with  docetaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil  ( HR 0.55 , 95 % CrI 0.54 - 0.89 ) and IC  with paclitaxel , cisplatin , fluorouracil  ( HR 0.55 , 95 % CrI 0.34 - 0.89 ) before CCRT are all superior to conventional RT . CCRT with  cisplatin  is also superior to altered fractionation RT ( HR 0.74 , 95 % CrI 0.64 - 0.84 ) . Altered fractionation RT is not superior to conventional RT ( HR 0.95 , 95 % CrI 0.85 - 1.06 ) . Regarding  PFS  , CCRT with cisplatin ( HR 0.72 , 95 % CrI 0.63 - 0.83 ) ,  cisplatin and fluorouracil  ( HR 0.67 , 95 % CrI 0.5 - 0.88 ) ,  carboplatin  ( HR 0.63 , 95 % CrI 0.46 - 0.87 ) ,  carboplatin and fluorouracil  ( HR 0.75 , 95 % CrI 0.56 - 1 ) , IC  with cisplatin and fluorouracil  ( HR 0.59 , 95 % CrI 0.45 - 0.78 ) , IC with  docetaxel , cisplatin and fluorouracil  ( HR 0.53 , 95 % CrI 0.41 - 0.68 ) and IC with  paclitaxel , cisplatin and fluorouracil  ( HR 0.59 , 95 % CrI 0.35 - 0.99 ) are superior to conventional  RT  and altered fractionation RT . IC with  docetaxel , cisplatin and fluorouracil  shows a significant superiority against CCRT with cisplatin ( HR 0.73 95 % CrI 0.58 - 0.92 ) .  Altered fractionation  RT is not superior to conventional RT ( HR 0.91 , 95 % CrI 0.81 - 1.02 ) .  Altered fractionation increases the risk of developing grade 3 - 4 mucositis  compared to conventional RT ( OR 3.74 95 % 1.64 - 8.67 ) INTERPRETATION : CCRT with cisplatin remains the gold st and ard of treatment . Taxane based IC regimens may have a impact on locally advanced disease .  Altered fractionation RT  is inferior to CCRT and also does not seem to be meaningfully better than conventionally fractionated RT alone . Its role in locally advanced disease should be reevaluated."
 The findings indicate that  telephone-delivered interventions  show promise in  reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety  . Further research is required to establish the types of interventions that are most effective and the characteristics of clients who find them beneficial.
" In this systematic overview , we categorised the efficacy for 22 comparisons based on information about the  effectiveness and safety of bDMARDs  ( monotherapy or combined with  csDMARDs ) ,  csDMARDs  (  monotherapy or  combined with other csDMARDs ) ,  glucocorticoids  combined with  methotrexate  or other csDMARDs , and  methotrexate  ( monotherapy  or  combined with other csDMARDs )  , identifying interventions which were likely or unlikely to be beneficial."
"nOBJECTIVE Data on  duration and long-term protective effects  of  hepatitis A vaccines ( HepA )  have not been review ed using a systematic approach . Our objective is to provide a comprehensive review of evidence on the  duration of protection  achieved by  HepA  , which is needed for revising existing vaccine policies . Limitations in data availability and implication s for future research in this area are discussed . METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted including  all studies published between 1997 and 2011 reporting on long-term protection of  HepA.   The outcomes considered were  hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) infection and sero-protection measured  by  anti-HAV antibodies  after follow-up times of over 5 years post-vaccination . RESULTS  299 studies were identified from MEDLINE and 51 studies from EMBASE . 13 manuscripts met our inclusion criteria .  The maximum observation times and reported persistence  levels of sero-protective anti-HAV antibodies  was 15 years for  live attenuated HepA  and 14 years for  inactivated HepA.  All data were from observational studies and showed that higher number of doses of live attenuated vaccine led to higher  seropositivity and GMT  , but dosage and schedule did not significantly impact the long-term protection following inactivated vaccine . Few comparisons were made between the two vaccine types indicating highest  levels of antibody titers  achieved by multiple doses of live attenuated vaccines 7 years post-vaccination .  Available data indicate that both inactivated and  live attenuated HepA  are capable of providing  protection  up to 15 years as defined by currently accepted , conservative correlates of protection . Further investigations are needed to continue to monitor the  long-term protection  afforded by these vaccines . St and ardized methods are required for vaccine-follow-up studies including assessment of co-variables potentially affecting long-term protection."
"eGlobal coverage of  infant  Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) vaccination   has increased considerably during the past decade , partly due to GAVI Alliance donations of the vaccine to  low-income  countries  .  In setting s where large numbers of  children  receive only one or two vaccine doses rather than the recommended three doses , dose-specific efficacy estimates are needed to predict impact . The objective of this meta- analysis is to determine   Hib vaccine  efficacy  against different clinical outcomes after receiving one , two or three doses of vaccine .  Studies were eligible for inclusion  if a prospect i ve , controlled design had been used to evaluate commercially available  Hib conjugate vaccines .   Eight studies were included .   Pooled vaccine efficacies against invasive Hib disease  after one , two or three doses of vaccine were 59 % , 92 % and 93 % , respectively . The meta- analysis provides robust estimates for use in decision-analytical models design ed to predict the impact of Hib vaccine."

"sAsthma is a common chronic respiratory disease in  children .  In addition to medications ,  physical therapy  is considered as a treatment strategy for  asthma .  We conducted this study to investigate the effects of  physical therapy  on  lung function  in  children with asthma .  Three data bases were search ed . We conducted the meta- analysis for the forced  expiratory volume  in the first second in percent predicted values [  FEV1(%pred  ) ] , the  forced vital capacity  in percent  predicted values [ FVC(%pred )  ] , and the  peak expiratory flow  in  percent predicted values  [  PEF(%pred  ) ] by using a r and om effect model . Of the  6474 identified studies ,  18 studies ( 16 in  physical training  , 2 in  breathing exercise or inspiratory muscle training )  were included in the systematic review and 11 studies ( all in  physical training )  were included in the meta- analysis . The meta- analysis showed a significantly improved  FVC(%pred )  in the experimental group .  Physical training  improved  FVC(%pred )  significantly  in children with asthma .  Further study is needed , especially on the effects of  breathing exercise  and inspiratory  muscle training  in children with asthma . Our study review ed the  physical therapies  for  children with asthma  and clarified whether and how these therapies affect them . Our study found that  physical training  improved the  forced vital capacity in percent predicted values [ FVC(%pred ) ]  significantly in  asthmatic children .  Our study provided evidence that  physical training  could improve  lung function  in  children  with asthma , which is not identical to the Global Initiative for Asthma ( GINA ) guidelines .

"eResearch es that developed interdisciplinary actions in schools seeking to modify the arteial pressure levels or salt and /or sodium consumption by  children  were analyzed . Studies available on the PubMed , ScienceDirect and Lilacs data bases , associating the keywords : intervention study ,  nutrition intervention  , schoolchildren , school health , blood pressure , sodium and salt were included . The research included  articles from the last 15 years , in Portuguese , English and Spanish , which had preschool or school children as participants .  With respect to the change of the  blood pressure levels  , 7 studies with positive and significant results and 6 without variation were identified . In terms of modification of the ingestion of food with high salt and /or sodium content , 4 studies revealed positive and significant results , and only one was unsuccessful . The conclusions drawn are that the interventions that use  nutritional education combined with physical activities  prevail in the literature . However , these actions proved to be more effective when implemented over a long period of time."

DATA SOURCES Medline , PsycINFO , Embase , HMIC , AMED ( OvidSP ) ; CDSR , CENTRAL , DARE ( Cochrane Library , Wiley ) ; CINAHL ( EBSCOhost ) ; British Nursing Index ( NHS Evidence ) ; ASSIA ( ProQuest ) ; Social Science Citation Index ( Web of Knowledge ) ; EThOS ( British Library ) ; Social Care Online and OpenGrey from inception to November 2012 . Forward and backward citation chases , h and search es of other review articles identified in the search , and key journals . TYPES OF STUDY All comparative studies were included . Articles were screened for inclusion independently by 2 review ers . Data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by one review er and checked by a second with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third if necessary . Data were not suitable for meta- analysis so narrative synthesis was carried out . RESULTS  A total of 6118 articles were identified in the original search  .  Eleven articles  were finally included .  Mealtime interventions  were categorized into 4 types :   music , changes to food service , dining environment alteration   , and   group conversation .   Study quality was poor , making it difficult to reach firm conclusions . Although all studies showed a trend in favor of the intervention , only 6 reported a statistically significant improvement in  behavioral symptoms .  Four studies suggest  cumulative  or  lingering  effects of music  on agitated and aggressive behaviors .   There is some evidence to suggest that  mealtime interventions  improve  behavioral symptoms  in  elderly people with dementia living in residential care  , although weak study design s limit the generalizability of the findings . Well design ed , controlled trials are needed to further underst and the utility of  mealtime interventions  in this setting."
"dAbstract This is a review of r and omized controlled trials of  intravenous 5-flurorouracil ( 5- FU)-containing chemotherapy  after curative resection versus  surgery alone  in  patients with gastric carcinoma  to determine the impact on survival rate , safety and economics . Data sources were the Cochrane Library ( 2006 , Issue 2 ) , Pub- Medline and Chinese Biomedical Data base .  We included 22 r and omized controlled trials comparing 4501 patients .   Intravenous 5-FU-containing chemotherapy  after  curative resection  had a slightly significant improvement in 3- , 5- and  7-year overall survival rate  ( OR 1.49 , 1.41 and 1.32 ) . No benefit of  postoperative disease-free survival rate  was induced by  5-FU-containing chemotherapy .  Sensitivity analysis was restricted to trials with the highest method ological quality , and the result was similar when the studies with Jadad score less than 3 ' were excluded . Subgroup analyses found borderline improved  overall survival rate  in both Western and Eastern countries but the statistical significance was stronger in the Eastern subset . The combinations of  5-FU plus mitomycin C , 5-FU plus cytosine arabinoside and 5-FU plus adriamycin or epidoxorubicin  induced potentially more improvement of  3-  and  5-year overall survival rates . Severe toxicities  were reported in  1629 patients  from 15 included trials , and  hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities  were the most remarkable side effects , around 5%-15 % respectively . The  chemotherapy-related overall mortality  was 1.1 % . No trials mentioned  cost-effectiveness analysis .  Although the results provide some evidence of a beneficial effect of adjuvant chemotherapy with  5-FU-containing regimens  , they are inconclusive due to the limitations of method ological quality of including r and omized controlled trials . Large scale r and omized controlled trials with a positive result are still m and atory before postoperative chemotherapy are recommended."
" While  the UCEIS , UCCIS and Mayo Clinic  Endoscopic Subscore have undergone extensive validation , none of these instruments have been fully vali date d and only two studies  assessed responsiveness  . Further research on the operating properties of these indices is needed given the lack of a fully-vali date d endoscopic scoring instrument for the evaluation of disease activity in  ulcerative  colitis."

"sPulsed  electromagnetic fields ( PEMF )  delivered by whole-body mats are promoted in many countries for a wide range of therapeutic applications and for enhanced well-being . However , neither the  therapeutic efficacy  nor the  potential health hazards  caused by these mats have been systematic ally evaluated . We conducted a systematic review of trials investigating the therapeutic effects of  low-frequency PEMF devices .  We were interested in all health outcomes addressed so far in r and omized , sham-controlled , double-blind trials . In total , 11 trials were identified . They were focused on   osteoarthritis of the knee   ( 3 trials ) or  the cervical spine  ( 1 ) ,  fibromyalgia  ( 1 ) ,  pain perception  ( 2 ) ,  skin ulcer healing  ( 1 ) ,  multiple sclerosis-related fatigue  ( 2 ) , or  heart rate variability and well-being  ( 1 ) . The  sample sizes  of the  trials ranged from 12 to 71 individuals .  The observation period lasted 12 weeks at maximum , and the applied magnetic flux densities ranged from 3.4 to 200 µT. In some trials sporadic  positive effects on health  were observed . However , independent confirmation of such singular findings was lacking . We conclude that the scientific evidence for  therapeutic  effects of whole-body  PEMF  devices is insufficient  . Acute adverse effects  have not been reported . However ,  adverse effects  occurring after long-term application have not been studied so far . In summary , the therapeutic use of low-frequency  whole-body PEMF devices  can not be recommended without more scientific evidence from high- quality , double-blind trials."
"eOBJECTIVE To establish whether  bilateral st and ing with visual feedback therapy  after  stroke  improves  postural control  compared with  conventional therapy  and to evaluate the generalization of the effects of  visual feedback therapy  on gait and gait-related activities . DESIGN A systematic review . METHODS A computer-aided literature search was performed . R and omized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials , comparing  visual feedback therapy  with  conventional balance treatments  were included up to April 2005 . The method ological quality of each study was assessed with the the Physiotherapy Evidence  Data base scale  . Depending on existing heterogeneity , studies with a common variable of outcome were pooled by calculating the summary effect-sizes using fixed or r and om effects models . RESULTS  Eight out of 78 studies , presenting 214 subjects ,  were included for qualitative and quantitative analysis . The method ological quality ranged from 3 to 6 points . The meta- analysis demonstrated non-significant  summary effect-sizes  in favour of visual feedback  therapy  for  weight distribution and postural sway , as well as balance and gait performance , and gait speed .   The additional value of  visual feedback therapy  in bilateral st and ing compared with  conventional therapy  shows no statistically significant effects on  symmetry of weight distribution  between paretic and non-paretic leg , postural  sway  in bilateral st and ing , gait and gait-related activities .  Visual feedback therapy  should not be favoured over  conventional therapy .  The question remains as to exactly how asymmetry in weight distribution while st and ing is related to balance control in patients with stroke."
"4I n this issue of Critical Care Medicine , Tang et al ( 1 ) provide a systematic review and meta- analysis of  nine controlled studies ( n 648 )  evaluating the effectiveness of  prolonged glucocorticoid  treatment  ( PGCT  )  in patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) ( 2–10 ) .  These studies ( Table 1 ) consistently report a significant improvement in  PaO2:FiO2  ( 2–10 ) and a  significant reduction in markers of systemic inflammation  ( 2–10 )  , multiple organ dysfunction score  ( 2 , 5 , 6 , 8–10 ) ,  duration of mechanical ventilation  ( 2,4–6,10 ) ,  and intensive care unit length of stay  ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 10 ) ( all with p values 0.05 ) without an  increased rate of complications .  The reduction in  duration of mechanical ventilation  is twoto three-fold greater than the reduction reported with low tidal volume ventilation or the conservative strategy of fluid management ( 11 , 12 ) . The more rapid  resolution of lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction scores  observed in these trials could positively affect  long-term physical recovery  ( 13 ) and  survival  ( 5 ) . The relevance of these findings to public health and healthcare economics urges investment in clinical investigation of this inexpensive and highly effective anti-inflammatory therapy . Because of differences in study design and patient characteristics and the limited size of the studies ( 1–4 ) , the cumulative mortality summary should be interpreted with some caution . Nevertheless , all four studies ( 2–5 ) ( n 334 ) investigating treatment initiated within 3 days of meeting acute lung injury and ARDS criteria showed a significant  reduction in mortality  , with an overall 24 % absolute reduction in mortality ( risk ratio , 0.69 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.56–0.84 ) . Two of the five studies ( 6 , 9 ) investigating treatment initiated after 5–7 days of meeting ARDS criteria showed a significant  reduction in mortality  , whereas three studies ( 7 , 8 , 10 ) found no  difference in mortality  , with an overall 15 % absolute reduction in mortality ( risk ratio , 0.75 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.55–1.02 ) that increased to 19 % for the  larger subgroup of patients ( n 233 ) r and omized before day 14  of  ARDS  ( risk ratio , 0.65 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.45–0.94 ) ( 6 , 8–10 ) . In the three studies without a  mortality benefit  ( 7 , 8 , 10 ) , treatment was associated with significant early physiologic improvement ; however , rapid dosage reduction ( 8) or premature removal after extubation ( as acknowledged by the authors ) ( 10 ) might have affected final outcome . In the ARDS  Network  trial , the treated group had— before removal of treatment — a noteworthy 9.5 days ’ reduction in  duration of  mechanical  ventilation  ( p 0.006 ) ( 10 ) . The  ARDS Network  trial reported a lower  mortality  for  patients ( n 132 ) r and omized before day 14  ( 27 % vs. 36 % ; p 0.14 ) and higher mortality for  patients ( n 48 ) r and omized after day 14 of ARDS  ( 8 % vs. 35 % ; p 0.01 ) ( 10 ) . The latter subgroup , however , had large imbalances in baseline characteristics and an uncharacteristically low mortality in the control group , and the  mortality  difference lost significance ( p 0.57 ) when adjusting for these imbalances ( 14 , 15 ) . Treatment decisions involve a tradeoff between benefits on the one h and and  risks , burdens  ,  and  ,  potentially  ,  costs  on the other ( 16 ) . As an aggregate ( n 648 ) , absolute and relative  reduction in mortality  is substantial for all patients ( 18 % and 35 % ) and even greater when treatment is initiated before day 14 of ARDS ( 21 % and 38 % ) . While awaiting a larger confirmatory trial in early acute lung injury and ARDS , this meta- analysis provides evidence of a sizable  reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay  and a  considerable survival benefit  with the potential saving of one life for every four treated patients ( 1 ) . In the United States alone , this could translate to tens of thous and s of lives  saved  per year and several billion dollars in  reduced healthcare expenditures  ( 17 ) . Furthermore , the low cost of off-patent  methylprednisolone  — in the United States approximately $ 240 for 28 days of intravenous therapy (5)—makes this treatment globally and equitably available . In their systematic review , Tang et al ( 1 ) report that PGCT at low-to-moderate doses was not associated with an  increased rate of major complications , including infections and neuromyopathy .  This counterintuitive finding deserves further elucidation and provides an opportunity to debunk common fallacies about glucocorticoid treatment-associated complications . Most misconceptions originate from the findings of sepsis and ARDS trials conducted in the 1980s that investigated a massive daily dose of  glucocorticoids ( methylprednisolone  , up to 120 mg/kg/day ) over a short time interval ( 24–48 hours ) . The experimental model supporting this treatment protocol relied on the intravenous administration of a  lethal bolus of lipopolysaccharide  that could be offset only by administering an equally massive dose of  glucocorticoids  before or within a brief experimentally generated inflammatory window ( 18–20 ) . This experimental model did not replicate human sepsis or acute lung injury and was discredited in the early 1990s ( 18 ) . Since then , longitudinal measurements of  inflammatory cytokines  in  ARDS patients  have clearly shown that  significant systemic and pulmonary inflammation  persists 28 days into the disease process ( 21–24 ) and that PGCT ( 14–21 days ) followed by slow tapering is essential to achieve and sustain biological resolution of the disease process ( 21 , 25 ) . In recent years , substantial evidence has accumulated showing that  systemic inflammation  , the central pathogenetic process in ARDS ( 21 , 22 , 24 ) , is also implicated in the type  of morbidity—  * See also p. 1594."
" Despite some evidence of an effect , there is insufficient evidence at this stage to strongly recommend any of the interventions to assist in decreasing the effects of CRCD , except in terms of improving quality of life."
 FCR research has exp and ed somewhat haphazardly over the last 20 years . Adopted consensual definition and used well-vali date d measures will be necessary . Longitudinal research examining the longer-term development and impact of FCR is clearly needed . The proposal and evaluation of theoretical models of FCR is a priority . Implication s for Cancer SurvivorsIdentifying the key features of FCR will stimulate the research and the development of targeted interventions for  cancer survivors  and their carers.
"nIT IS ESTIMATED THAT UP TO 107000 CASES OF  ACUTE LUNG injury ( ALI ) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS )  occur yearly in the United States . Although the mortality rate from ARDS has been decreasing , between 17000 and 43000  patients die  from  ALI and ARDS  annually . Despite substantial progress in underst and ing the pathophysiology of this syndrome and numerous r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of both  pharmacological agents  and  mechanical ventilatory strategies  , the only interventions shown to reduce mortality have been  lung-protective strategies  of  mechanical ventilation  that decreased tidal volume . In the ARDS Network trial , tidal volume limitation was associated with a clinical ly and statistically significant 22 % relative reduction in mortality for  patients with ALI and ARDS .  Central to the success of these trials is the concept that mechanical ventilation itself perpetuates lung injury . Although this concept has led to positive studies of interventions to decrease iatrogenic lung damage complicating ARDS , no multicenter trial has convincingly demonstrated benefit from interventions such as  surfactants , corticosteroids , ketoconazole ,  or  other therapies  that treat the underlying pathogenic mechanisms or physiological perturbations that characterize ALI and ARDS . In the context of an empty therapeutic armamentarium for lung injury , considerable research efforts and clinical enthusiasm greeted the discovery of  nitric oxide  ( NO ) . From a clinical perspective , inhaled  nitric oxide  has many of the properties of an ideal pulmonary vasodilator . It acts on the endothelial surface of the lung to produce regional vasodilation in ventilated lung units . As a result , nitric oxide was expected to produce relatively selective  pulmonary vasodilation  that in theory would improve the  ventilationperfusion mismatch , hypoxemia , and pulmonary hypertension  characteristic of ARDS . The short half-life of nitric oxide suggested that it was free of significant systemic hemodynamic  effects .  Given the potential role of nitric oxide as a pulmonary vasodilator , its use as a therapeutic agent increased dramatically and rapidly . A survey of members of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine in 1997 found that  63.2 % of respondents ( 196/310 )  prescribed inhaled  nitric oxide  , primarily for treatment of  ALI and ARDS .  Consistent with the role of nitric oxide as a pulmonary vasodilator , earlier case series and a single-center RCT demonstrated that it induces short-term  improvements  in  oxygenation and pulmonary vascular resistance  in  patients with lung injury .  Unfortunately , these physiologic gains have not translated into improved patient outcomes when nitric oxide was evaluated in larger controlled studies . A recent systematic review of 5 RCTs of  inhaled nitric oxide vs placebo or no therapy  for  acute  hypoxemic respiratory failure  ( including ALI , ARDS , and  other  diagnoses ) in adults and children  concluded that inhaled  nitric oxide  produced modest improvements in  oxygenation  for up to 72 hours but had no effect on  mortality  ( pooled relative risk using fixed effects model , 0.98 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.661.44 ) or on the  duration of mechanical ventilation .  In addition to direct effects on gas exchange ,  nitric oxide  has potentially beneficial  immunological properties ;  it inhibits  platelet aggregation  and  neutrophil adhesion .  The anti-inflammatory properties of  nitric oxide  have been postulated to explain decreased ischemia-reperfusion lung injury in animal models and in small observational studies of lung transplantation . However , a recent RCT of  nitric oxide  administered immediately after lung transplantation failed to demonstrate an improvement in either  oxygenation variables  or  clinical outcomes .  In this issue of THE JOURNAL , Taylor and colleagues make an important contribution to this literature . Between 1996 and 1999 , the investigators  enrolled 385 patients with moderately severe ALI and ARDS in a  r and omized  placebocontrolled  multicenter trial of  inhaled nitric oxide  at 5 ppm . The rationale for this dose was based on an earlier  placebocontrolled  RCT that evaluated several doses of  nitric oxide  ( 1.25 , 5 , 20 , 40 , or 80 ppm ) in  177 patients with ARDS .  Although there was no clinical benefit in the  nitric oxide  group overall in that study , a post-hoc analysis suggested that patients receiving  nitric oxide  at 5 ppm had significantly improved  ventilation-free survival  28 days after r and omization."
"DBACKGROUND COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the world . It is a common , progressive , treatable and preventable disease . The exacerbation of COPD is associated with the peripheral muscle force , forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) , the  quality of life  and  mortality .  Many studies indicated that the mucoactive medicines could reduce the exacerbations of COPD . This study summarized the efficacy of  carbocisteine  as a treatment for COPD . METHODS We search ed the r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) following electronic bibliographic data bases : MedLine , Embase , Cochrane Library and Web of Science . We additionally search ed gray literature data base : OpenSIGLE . We also additionally search ed the clinical trial registers : Clinical Trials.gov register and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal . We used RCTs to assess the efficacy of the treatments . We included  studies of adults ( older than 18 years ) with COPD .  We excluded  studies that were published as protocol or written in non-English language (  Number  42016047078  ) . FINDINGS Our findings included data from  four studies involving 1,357 patients .  There was a decrease in the  risk of the rate of total number of exacerbations  with  carbocisteine  compared with  placebo  ( -0.43 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] -0.57 , -0.29 , P<0.01 ) .  Carbocisteine  could also improve the  quality of life  ( -6.29 ; 95 % CI -9.30 , -3.27 ) and  reduce the number of patients with at least one exacerbation  ( 0.86 ; 95 % CI 0.78 , 0.95 ) compared with  placebo .  There was no significant  difference  in the  FEV1 and adverse effects and the rate of hospitalization .  INTERPRETATION Long-term use of  carbocisteine  ( 500 mg TID ) may be associated with lower  exacerbation rates  , the smaller number of  patients  with at least  one exacerbation  and higher  quality of life  of patients with COPD."
 Routine HRQoL measurement is a costly exercise and there is no robust evidence to suggest that it is of benefit in improving psychosocial outcomes of  patients managed in non-psychiatric setting s.  Major policy initiatives to increase the routine collection and use of outcome measures in psychiatric setting s are unevaluated.
"yVitamin D has well-defined classical functions related to calcium metabolism and bone health but also has non-classical effects that may influence other aspects of health . There has been considerable recent interest in the role of  vitamin D  on outcomes related to pregnancy and young child health but few efforts have been made to systematic ally consoli date this evidence to inform the research and policy agenda for  low-income countries .  A systematic review was undertaken to identify intervention and observational studies of  vitamin D supplementation , intake or status ( 25-hydroxy-vitamin D )  during  pregnancy  on  perinatal and infant health outcomes  . Data from trials and observational studies isolating the effect of  vitamin D supplementation  and intake were extracted and study quality was evaluated . Meta- analysis was used to pool effect estimates . We identified  five r and omised trials  with outcomes of relevance to our review . All had small sample size and dosage amount , duration and frequency varied as did the ability to correct deficiency . Pooled analysis of trials using fixed-effects models suggested protective effects of supplementation on  low birthweight  ( three trials , risk ratio ( RR ) = 0.40 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.23 , 0.71 ] ) and non-significant but suggestive effects of daily supplementation on  small-for-gestational age  ( two trials , RR = 0.67 [ 0.40 , 1.11 ] ) . No effect on  preterm delivery  ( <  37  weeks ) was evident ( two trials , RR = 0.77 [ 0.35 , 1.66 ] ) . Little evidence from trials exists to evaluate the effect of  vitamin D supplementation  during pregnancy on  maternal , perinatal or infant health outcomes  . Based on both trials and observational studies , we recommend that future research explore  small-for-gestational age , preterm delivery , pre-eclampsia , and maternal and childhood infections  , as outcomes of interest . Trials should focus on  population s with  a  high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency  , explore the relevance of timing of supplementation , and the dosage used in such trials should be sufficient to correct deficiency."
 There is no evidence to suggest that probiotics are beneficial for the  maintenance of remission  in  CD .  All of the included studies enrolled  small numbers of patients  and may have lacked statistical power to show differences should they exist . Larger trials are required to determine if  probiotics  are of benefit in  Crohn 's disease .
" Evidence suggests that receipt of BCG and  MCV  reduce  overall mortality  by more than would be expected through their effects on the diseases they prevent , and receipt of DTP may be associated with an increase in  all cause mortality .  Although efforts should be made to ensure that all children are immunised on schedule with  BCG , DTP  , and  MCV  , r and omised trials are needed to compare the effects of different sequences."
"yBackground Vitamins and minerals are essential for growth and metabolism . The World Health Organization estimates that more than 2 billion people are deficient in key vitamins and minerals . Groups most vulnerable to these micronutrient deficiencies are  pregnant and lactating women and young children  ,  given their increased dem  and  s.  Food  fortification  is one of the strategies that has been used safely and effectively to prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies . Methods A comprehensive search was done to identify all available evidence for the impact of  fortification interventions  . Studies were included if food was  fortified with a single , dual or multiple micronutrients  and impact of fortification was analyzed on the health outcomes and relevant biochemical indicators of  women and children .  We performed a meta- analysis of outcomes using Review Manager Software version 5.1 . Results Our systematic review identified  201 studies that we review ed  for outcomes of relevance . Fortification for children showed significant impacts on increasing  serum micronutrient concentrations . Hematologic markers  also improved , including  hemoglobin concentrations  , which showed a significant rise when food was fortified with  vitamin A ,  iron and multiple  micronutrients  . Fortification with zinc had no significant adverse impact on  hemoglobin levels .   Multiple micronutrient fortification  showed non-significant impacts on  height for age , weight for age and weight for height Z-scores  , although they showed positive trends . The results for fortification in women showed that calcium and vitamin D fortification had significant impacts in the post-menopausal age group . Iron fortification led to a significant increase in  serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels  in  women of reproductive age and pregnant women .  Folate fortification significantly reduced the  incidence of congenital abnormalities like neural tube defects  without increasing the  incidence of twinning .  The number of studies pooled for zinc and multiple micronutrients for women were few , though the evidence suggested benefit . There was a dearth of evidence for the impact of fortification strategies on  morbidity and mortality outcomes  in  women and children .  Conclusion Fortification is potentially an effective strategy but evidence from the developing world is scarce . Programs need to assess the direct impact of fortification on morbidity and mortality."
 The findings of this systematic review suggest  that  HFO does not reduce  hospital and 30-day mortality  due to ARDS ; the quality of evidence was very low . Our findings do not support the use  of  HFO as a first-line strategy in people undergoing mechanical ventilation for ARDS.
"dSince novel treatments to target  eosinophilic inflammation  in  Type 2 asthma  are emerging , we aim ed to evaluate and meta-analyze the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies to reduce  exacerbation rate  . PubMed and Web of Science were search ed for phase II and phase III r and omized clinical trials with  monoclonal antibodies  targeting  key mediators of type 2-associated asthma . Thirty  trials were selected involving biologics that target the IL-5 pathway , IL-13 , the common IL-4 and IL-13 receptor , IL-9 , IL-2 and TSLP . As no head-to-head trials were retrieved from literature , we performed an arm-based network meta- analysis to compare  effects on exacerbation rate  between the different treatments .  Mepolizumab , reslizumab  and  benralizumab  significantly  reduced the risk of exacerbations  compared to placebo ( by 47–52 % , 50–60 % , and 28–51 % respectively ) .  Reslizumab  and  benralizumab   also improved lung function .  Dupilumab and tezepelumab  improved lung function in frequent exacerbators  . Lebrikizumab had  no significant effect on the number of exacerbations , symptom control or health-related quality of life .   Tralokinumab   improved lung function  compared to   placebo   . Network meta- analysis of all treatment and placebo arms , showed no superiority of one biologic over the others .  Large reductions in exacerbation rates  were observed compared to placebo , though only benralizumab was sufficiently powered ( n = 2051 ) to demonstrate significantly  decreased exacerbation rates  in the subgroup analysis of IL-5 acting agents compared to placebo . Monoclonal antibodies such as  mepolizumab , reslizumab  and  benralizumab  have proven their benefit to  reduce exacerbation rates  in severe  persistent eosinophilic asthma  in the published trials . However , no statistically significant superiority was observed of one biologic over the other in the network meta- analysis . More studies with direct head to head comparisons and better defined endotypes are required."

" In  children aged between 3 and 16 years  , live  influenza vaccines  probably reduce influenza ( moderate-certainty evidence ) and may reduce  ILI  ( low-certainty evidence ) over a single influenza season . In this population inactivated  vaccines  also reduce  influenza  ( high-certainty evidence ) and may reduce  ILI  ( low-certainty evidence ) . For both vaccine types , the absolute reduction  in influenza and ILI  varied considerably across the study population s , making it difficult to predict how these findings translate to different setting s. We found very few r and omised controlled trials in  children under two years of age .   Adverse event data  were not well described in the available studies . St and ardised approaches to the definition , ascertainment , and reporting of adverse events are needed . Identification of all global cases of potential harms is beyond the scope of this review."
"nThe gold st and ard for diagnosing  asthma in children  is based on clinical history of respiratory symptoms , physical examination , and respiratory function testing . Recent advances indicate that a non-invasive measure of  airway inflammation , fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO )  , provides objective data for use in asthma diagnosis . However , the diagnostic performance of FeNO in  children  with  asthma  has not been clearly defined . This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to evaluate the  diagnostic accuracy  of  FeNO  in the clinical determination of  asthma in children .  Data bases of PubMed , the Cochrane Library , EMBASE , MEDION , and Web of Science were search ed for relevant articles through March 31 , 2016 . A bivariate model was used for pooling estimates of  sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic odds ratio ( DOR )  , and area under the summary receiver operating curves ( SROC ) as the main diagnostic measures .  In total , eight studies met the inclusion criteria , which included 2933 subjects .  The pooled  estimates of sensitivity , specificity , and DOR  for the detection of  asthma in children  were 0.79 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.64–0.89 ] , 0.81 ( 95 % CI , 0.66–0.90 ) , and 16.52 ( 95 % CI , 7.64–35.71 ) . The  SROC  was 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.84–0.90 ) . In brief ,  FeNO achieves  a  moderate diagnostic performance  in the detection of asthma in children."
"sThis meta- review summarizes existing evidence from systematic review s and meta-analyses on the effectiveness of   school-based psychological interventions   aim ed at improving  student  mental health and well-being   , and preventing  mental illness .  Systematic review s and meta-analyses were identified via the electronic data bases PsycINFO , Web of Knowledge , Medline , Embase , and HMIC ( Health Management Information Consortium ) .  Ten systematic review s and meta- analysis were eligible  for inclusion in the final analyses . These systematic review s and meta-analyses evaluated the effects of five types of  school-based psychological interventions :  Mindfulness , Social Emotional Learning , Cognitive Behavioral Therapy , Yoga , and Body-Image .  Overall effectiveness  reported in the included studies was significant for the most part , and ranging from small to large with respect to the effect size . The authors of all of the studies emphasized the need for additional high- quality trials to further examine the effectiveness of  school-based psychological interventions  aim ed at improving  student  mental health and well-being   , and preventing mental illness."
"dTriple  negative breast cancer ( TNBC )  represents 15–20 % of breast cancers . Due to its heterogeneity and high rates of relapse , there is a need to optimize treatment efficacy .  Platinum chemotherapy  is still controversial and currently not recommended as first-line treatment for TNBC . Recent studies have shown promising activity of this regimen . This study was done to evaluate the effect of  platinum chemotherapy  on  pathologic complete response ( pCR )  after neoadjuvant treatment for early TNBC and progression-free survival ( PFS ) in metastatic TNBC . A systematic search of Pubmed , Embase , Cochrane , Clinical trials data bases and h and search were done to identify r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) investigating the use of  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in adults with TNBC .  Studies were appraised using the Cochrane Collaboration tool . Using the r and om effects model ,  pooled Odds ratios ( ORs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for pCR  , and  Hazard Ratios ( HRs ) with 95%CI for PFS  were analyzed .  Eleven RCTs were included ( N = 2946 ) .   Platinum-based chemotherapy  showed  pCR benefit  of 40%vs27 % ( OR1.75,95 % CI 1.46–2.62,p < 0.0001 ) in the neo-adjuvant setting . Subgroup analysis showed  increased pCR rates  ( 44.6%vs27.8 % ) with platinum plus  taxane  regimen ( p < 0.0001 ) . In metastatic TNBC , three RCTs were analyzed ( N = 531 ) ,  platinum treatment  did not show  PFS advantage  ( HR1.16,95%CI 0.90–1.49,p = 0.24  ) . Platinum chemotherapy  is associated with  increased pCR rates  in TNBC , hence it is a viable option for patients in the neoadjuvant setting . Subgroup analysis showed that the  combination of platinum and taxanes ( Carboplatin/Paclitaxel )   improved pCR .  However ,  no PFS advantage  was seen in metastatic TNBC . Given the current conflicting data in metastatic TNBC , further exploration with additional powered studies is needed."
"nBackground  Person-centered care  is a holistic and integrative approach design ed to maintain well-being and quality of life for  people with dementia  , and it includes the elements of care , the individual , the carers , and the family . Aim A systematic literature review and meta- analysis were undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of  person-centered care  for  people with dementia .  Methods Literature search es were undertaken using  six data bases  including  Medline , EMBASE , CINAHL , PsycINFO , Cochrane Data base , and KoreaMed  using the following keywords : cognition disorder , dementia ,  person-centered care , patient-centered care , client-centered care , relationship-centered care , and dementia care .  The search es were limited to interventional studies written in English  and Korean  and included r and omized controlled studies and noncontrolled studies for  people with dementia living in any setting .  Results  Nineteen interventional studies , including 3,985 participants , were identified .  Of these , 17  studies  were  from long-term care facilities  and  two  studies were from  homecare setting  s. The pooled data from r and omized controlled studies favored  person-centered care  in  reducing agitation , neuropsychiatric symptoms , and depression and improving the quality of life .  Subgroup analysis identified greater  effectiveness  of  person-centered care  when implemented for  people with less severe dementia .  For  agitation  , short-term interventions had a greater effect ( st and ardized mean difference [ SMD ] : −0.434 ; 95 % conference interval [ CI ] : −0.701 to −0.166 ) than long-term interventions ( SMD : −0.098 ; 95 % CI : −0.190 to 0.007 ) . Individualized activities result ed in a significantly greater  beneficial  effect than st and ard care ( SMD : 0.513 ; 95 % CI : −0.994 to −0.032 ) . However ,  long-term , staff education , and cultural change interventions  had a greater effect on  improving the quality of life  for people with dementia ( SMD : 0.191 ; 95 % CI : 0.079 to 0.302 ) . Conclusion This systematic review and meta- analysis provided evidence for person-centered care in clinical practice for people with dementia .  Person-centered care  interventions were shown to  reduce agitation , neuropsychiatric symptoms , and depression and to improve the quality of life .   Person-centered care interventions  can effectively  reduce agitation  for a short term using intensive and activity-based intervention . However , an  educational strategy  that promotes learning and skill development of internal care staff is needed to enhance patient ’s  quality of life  and to ensure the sustainability of the effects of behavioral problems . The  feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention  , the  severity of patient disease  , and  intervention type and duration  should be considered as part of an intervention design."
"  Influenza vaccines  are efficacious in  children older than two years  but little evidence is available for  children under two .  There was a marked difference between  vaccine efficacy and effectiveness .  That no safety comparisons could be carried out emphasizes the need for st and ardisation of methods and presentation of vaccine safety data in future studies . It was surprising to find only one study of inactivated vaccine in children under two years , given recent recommendations to vaccinate  healthy children from six months old in the USA and Canada .  If immunisation in children is to be recommended as public-health policy , large-scale studies assessing important outcomes and directly comparing vaccine types are urgently required."
"sBACKGROUND The effects of cancer and treatment have severe and long lasting negative impacts on  quality of life .   Adolescents and Young Adults ( AYA )  have high survival  rates  but may not reach their full life potential because of these consequences . This review aims to identify , appraise and synthesis e the effects of  health promotion and psychological interventions  for  AYA after cancer treatment .  METHODS The review was undertaken using the preferred reporting items for systematic review s and meta-analyses guidelines . Included studies were identified though a range of electronic data bases through to May  2016 .  Studies were critically appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool . RESULTS  Seventeen studies , comprising a total of 2314 participants aged 13 - 39years were included in this review . Participants in 15 studies were survivors of childhood cancer  , with  only two studies specifically recruiting survivors of cancer diagnosed during young adulthood .  Ten studies were r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) ; the remaining seven were before and after studies . The quality of studies was variable across all appraised domains ; risk of bias was evident in regards to  recruitment , measures of exposure and outcomes , confounding factors , attrition and lost-to follow-up .  Studies evaluated a range of  health promotion and psychological interventions  to improve  health related and process outcomes .  Eleven studies reported modest  positive  outcomes , with psychological and physical activity interventions achieving greater success compared to general health promotion interventions .  This review highlights the lack of high- quality studies for optimising the  health and well-being  of  AYA cancer survivors .  No conclusive evidence favouring specific interventions were identified , although recommendations for future studies are made . Interventions delivered face-to-face and those that facilitate peer-to-peer support hold promise . Harnessing social media and technology to deliver interventions is likely to increase and these modes of delivery require further investigations."
"sInterventions to reduce  college student drinking  , although efficacious , generally yield only small effects on behavior change . Examining mechanisms of change may help to improve the magnitude of intervention effects by identifying effective and ineffective active ingredients . Informed by guidelines for establishing mechanisms of change , we conducted a systematic review of  alcohol interventions  for  college students  to identify ( a ) which constructs have been examined and received support as mediators , ( b ) circumstances that enhance the likelihood of detecting mediation , and ( c ) the extent of evidence for mechanisms of change . We identified  61 trials that  examined 22 potential mediators of intervention efficacy . Descriptive norms consistently mediated  normative feedback interventions .  Motivation to change consistently failed to mediate  motivational interviewing interventions . Multiple active ingredient interventions  were not substantially more likely to find evidence of mediation than  single ingredient interventions .  Delivering intervention content remotely reduced likelihood of finding support for mediation . With the exception of descriptive norms , there is inadequate evidence for the psychosocial constructs purported as mechanisms of change in the college drinking literature . Evidence for mechanisms will be yielded by future studies that map all active ingredients to targeted psychosocial outcomes and that assess potential mediators early , inclusively , and at appropriate intervals following interventions."

"nObjectives  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO )  is an increasingly accepted means of supporting  those with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) .  Given the high mortality associated with ARDS , numerous animal models have been developed to support translational research . Where ARDS is combined with ECMO , models are less well characterized . Therefore , we conducted a systematic literature review of animal models combining features of experimental ARDS with ECMO to better underst and this situation . Data sources MEDLINE and Embase were search ed between January 1996  and  December 2018 . Study selection Inclusion criteria :   animal models combining features of experimental ARDS with ECMO .   Exclusion criteria : clinical studies , abstract s , studies in which the model of ARDS and ECMO has been reported previously , and studies not employing veno-venous , veno-arterial , or central ECMO  .  Data extraction Data were extracted to fully characterize models . Variables related to four key features : ( 1 ) study design , ( 2 ) animals and their peri-experimental care , ( 3 ) models of ARDS and mechanical ventilation , and ( 4 )  ECMO  and its intra-experimental management . Data synthesis  Seventeen models of ARDS and ECMO  were identified .  Twelve  were  published after 2009 .  All were performed  in large animals , the majority ( n = 10 ) in pigs .  The  median  number of animals included  in each study was 17 ( 12–24 )  , with  a median study duration  of  8 h  ( 5–24 ) .  Oleic acid  infusion was the commonest means of inducing ARDS . Most models employed peripheral veno-venous ECMO ( n = 12 ) . The  reporting of supportive measures and the practice of mechanical ventilation  were highly variable . Descriptions of ECMO equipment and its management were more complete . Conclusion A limited number of models combine the features of experimental ARDS with ECMO . Among those that do , there is significant heterogeneity in both design and reporting . There is a need to st and ardize the reporting of pre- clinical studies in this area and to develop best practice in their design."
"sObjective : To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aim ed at improving the  sexuality of women with multiple sclerosis .  Data sources : MEDLINE , CINAHL , PsycINFO , Web of Science , Scopus , Embase and the Cochrane Library , as well as doctoral thesis data bases Teseo and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and the grey literature data base Opengrey were search ed , last on 15 October 2019 . Journals related to the topic were also consulted . The bibliographic references of the articles included were review ed . Method :  Studies were selected if they included women with multiple sclerosis in whom interventions aim ed at reducing sexual  dysfunction  were applied .  Data extraction was carried out by two independent review ers .  The Jadad scale was  used  to evaluate  the  method ological quality  of the studies included . Results : In total , 12 clinical trials were selected  , and 611 patients were examined .  Studies were classified into six interventions :  sexual therapy ( 4 ) , pharmaceutical drugs ( 3 ) , pelvic floor exercises ( 2 ) , yoga (  1  ) , mindfulness (  1  )  and  vaginal devices  ( 1 ) . Most of them improved some primary outcomes of  sexual dysfunction  such as  lubrication , arousal , desire or orgasm . Pain  was the most common secondary outcome evaluated and it became better in two studies including  sexual  therapy and in one intervention with  pelvic floor exercises .  Tertiary outcomes such as  anxiety or depression  were rarely examined , and they improved with sexual therapy and with OnabotulinumtoxinA. Conclusion : Sexual therapy , administration  of OnabotulinumtoxinA , pelvic floor muscles exercises alone  or  combined  with  electrostimulation  and the  use of clitoral  devices could be the most recommended interventions to improve the  sexuality  in women with multiple sclerosis."
" This review , based on studies with high or moderate risk of bias , showed that there was no statistically significant difference between  ambulatory management and hospital care  , regarding reduction of  mortality rates  in pregnancies complicated by diabetes or hyperglycemia .

"lObjective : Assessment of the available evidence for the effectiveness of  exercise therapy  to improve  arm function  in  patients who have suffered from a stroke .  Methods : A systematic search of bibliographical data bases and reference checking were performed to identify publications on r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) which evaluated the effect of  exercise therapy  on arm  function  in  stroke patients .  The method ological quality was assessed systematic ally by two raters , based on a st and ardized list of method ological criteria . Study characteristics , such as the  chronicity and severity of impairment  of the patient population , the amount and duration of interventions , and specific method ological criteria , were related to reported effects . Results :  Thirteen RCTs were  identified , six of which reported positive results on an  arm function test .  In five of these six studies there was a contrast in  amount or duration of  exercise therapy   between groups .  Method ological scores  ranged from 5 to 15 ( maximum possible score : 19 points ) . Conclusion : Insufficient evidence made it impossible to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of  exercise therapy  on arm function in  stroke patients .  The difference in results between studies with and without contrast in the amount or duration of  exercise therapy  between groups suggests that more  exercise therapy  may be beneficial."

"sBACKGROUND The impairment of verbal skills of  people with dementia  challenges communication . The aim of this review was to study the effects of  nonpharmacological interventions  in  residential and nursing homes  on ( 1 ) communication between  residents with dementia and care staff  , and ( 2 ) the neuropsychiatric symptoms of  residents with dementia .  METHOD Pubmed , PsychInfo , Web of Science , the Cochrane Library , and reference lists from relevant publications were systematic ally search ed to find articles about controlled interventions with  communication strategies .  The data collected were pooled and subjected to a meta- analysis . RESULTS  Nineteen intervention studies were selected  for this review . They included  structured and communicative "" sessions at set times "" for residents  ( e.g.  life review )  and  communication techniques in activities  of "" daily care "" applied by care staff ( e.g. sensitivity to  nonverbal communication  ) . A meta- analysis of five set-time  interventions  ( communication ) and another meta- analysis of four set-time interventions ( neuropsychiatric outcomes ) found no significant overall effects . Individual set-time intervention studies report positive  effects on communication  when interventions are  single-task  sessions , like  life  review or  one-on-one conversation  . Interventions around daily care activities had positive effects on  communication outcomes .  Effects of both types of interventions on  neuropsychiatric symptoms  were divergent .  This review indicates that care  staff  can improve their communication with  residents with dementia  when strategies are embedded in daily care activities or interventions are single-task sessions at set times . These results offer the possibility of improving the  quality of care  , but not of directly reducing  neuropsychiatric symptoms .  More research is needed to study the effect of  communication interventions  on neuropsychiatric symptoms."

"aNo study has systematic ally review ed the evidence on presentation of  oropharyngeal dysphagia and swallowing rehabilitation following  esophagectomy  .  The purpose s of this systematic review are to 1 ) qualitatively synthesize the current findings on oropharyngeal swallowing abnormalities identified by  instrumental swallowing evaluations  , 2 ) describe the reported health-related outcomes in relation to swallowing abnormality following esophagectomy , and 3 ) examine the efficacy of reported rehabilitative interventions for  oropharyngeal dysphagia in patients who underwent esophagectomy .  Publications were search ed using five electronic data bases . No language or publication date restrictions were imposed . Two authors performed a blind review for published or unpublished studies that reported swallowing biomechanics and dysphagic symptoms using  instrumental evaluation of swallowing  , specifically the  videofluoroscopic swallowing study and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing  , and /or health-related outcomes in relation to swallowing abnormalities , and /or therapeutic interventions for oropharyngeal dysphagia following esophagectomy .  Twelve studies out of 2,193 studies including 458 patients met the inclusion criteria .  Reported  abnormal swallowing biomechanics  included  vocal fold immobility , delayed onset of swallowing , reduced hyolaryngeal elevation  , and  reduced opening of the upper esophageal sphincter . Aspiration  ( 0 - 81 % ) and  pharyngeal residue  ( 22 - 100 % ) were prevalent . Those  abnormal swallowing biomechanics and swallowing symptoms  were commonly reported following both transhiatal and transthoracic esophagectomy .  Pneumonia  presented in 5 - 25 % of the study patients . One quasi-experimental study examined the  effectiveness of  swallowing exercises   for postoperative oropharyngeal dysphagia ; three case series reported a benefit of the chin-tuck maneuver in reducing  aspiration and residue .  This review revealed distinct swallowing impairments and increased  pneumonia risks  following esophagectomy . This review also found that evidence on the  efficacy  of therapeutic interventions was limited . Future studies are warranted to develop effective rehabilitative interventions for postesophagectomy patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia."
"7Women  with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS )  exhibit many metabolic abnormalities that are associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk .  Exercise  may promote improvements in lipid profile and insulin sensitivity in  women with PCOS .  There is however , a knowledge gap on the optimal dose of exercise , regarding duration , intensity , type , and frequency of exercise . The aim of this systematic review and meta- analysis was to define effective types of  exercise  to improve cardiometabolic profile in PCOS . We included r and omised controlled trials ( RCT ) , quasi- RCT , and controlled clinical trials focusing on  reproductive-aged women diagnosed with PCOS .  Eligible interventions included  those with at least two weeks of supervised exercise sessions .  Primary outcomes were  blood lipids , blood glucose , blood pressure , measures of abdominal adiposity , and inflammation markers  . Secondary outcomes were  total and free testosterone , sex hormone binding globulin , and measures of insulin resistance  . Nine electronic data bases were search ed from inception to present for English language publications . The Cochrane Risk Assessment tool was used to assess bias in the included studies . Outcomes were quantitatively synthesis ed and a meta- analysis was performed . Pooled effect estimates and 95 % confidence intervals were presented . This systematic review identified  three trials , including 231 participants with PCOS  , that examined the effect  of structured , supervised exercise  on cardiometabolic outcomes . Analysis of pooled data indicated statistical favourable  effects of exercise  on  total cholesterol , fasting glucose , waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio , systolic blood pressure , C-reactive protein , total testosterone , and sex hormone binding globulin  using post-intervention  scores . Moderate aerobic exercise interventions  ≥3 months in duration , with a frequency of 3/week for at least 30-min , may have favourable effects on various cardiometabolic risk factors in  women with PCOS .  However , results should be interpreted with caution . Many of the outcomes were based on studies with serious method ological limitations , and only one “ gold-st and ard ” RCT was identified .

"dEngagement in  electronic health  ( eHealth ) and  mobile health ( mHealth ) behavior change  interventions is thought to be important for intervention effectiveness , though what constitutes engagement and how it enhances efficacy has been somewhat unclear in the literature . Recently published detailed definitions and conceptual models of engagement have helped to build consensus around a definition of engagement and improve our underst and ing of how engagement may influence effectiveness . This work has helped to establish a clearer research agenda . However , to test the hypotheses generated by the conceptual modules , we need to know how to measure engagement in a valid and reliable way . The aim of this viewpoint is to provide an overview of  engagement measurement  options that can be employed in  eHealth and mHealth behavior change intervention  evaluations , discuss method ological considerations , and provide direction for future research . To identify measures , we used  snowball sampling  , starting from systematic review s of engagement research as well as those utilized in studies known to the authors . A wide range of methods to measure  engagement  were identified , including  qualitative  measures   ,   self-report  question naires , ecological momentary assessment s , system  usage  data , sensor data , social media data  , and  psychophysiological measures .  Each measurement method is appraised and examples are provided to illustrate possible use in eHealth and  mHealth  behavior change research . Recommendations for future research are provided , based on the limitations of current methods and the heavy reliance on system  usage data  as the sole assessment of engagement . The validation and adoption of a wider range of  engagement measurements  and their thoughtful application to the study of engagement are encouraged."

"sBackground :  Preterm infants often experience difficulty with the transition from tube to oral feeding .  While many  unimodal and multimodal sensorimotor interventions  have been generated to optimize oral  feeding skills  , there has been little cohesion between interventions . Purpose : The aims of this systematic review were to examine the effect of  sensorimotor interventions  on  oral feeding outcomes  and to determine whether  multimodal interventions  lead to better  oral feeding performances  than  unimodal  interventions . Search Strategy : A systematic search of CINAHL , Embase , MEDLINE , and PsycINFO data bases was conducted . Studies were review ed to assess the types of interventions used to improve  transition to full oral feeding , volume intake , weight gain , and length of hospital stay .  Results : The search  identified 35 articles .  Twenty-six studies examined a  unimodal intervention  , with the majority focusing on  oral sensorimotor input  and the others on  tactile , auditory , and olfactory input .  Nine studies assessed  multimodal interventions  , with the combination of tactile and kinesthetic stimulation being most common . Results varied across studies due to large differences in methodology , and caution is warranted when interpreting results across studies . The heterogeneity in the studies made it difficult to make any firm conclusions about the effects of   sensorimotor interventions  on feeding outcomes .  Overall , evidence on whether  multimodal  approaches can lead to  better oral feeding outcomes  than a  unimodal  approach was insufficient . Implication s for Practice : The use of  sensorimotor interventions  to  optimize feeding outcomes  in  preterm infants  varies based on methods used and modalities . These factors warrant caution by clinicians who use  sensorimotor interventions  in the neonatal intensive care unit . Implication s for Research : Large r and omized clinical trials using a st and ardized approach for the  administration of sensorimotor input  are needed to further establish the effects on  feeding outcomes  in preterm infants."
"nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ( GDM ) is a serious health concern for  pregnant women  , with  Hispanic women  at particular risk for developing the condition . The aim of this review was to critically examine  GDM intervention programs  for  Hispanic women , in the United States of America ( US ) .  METHODS  English and Spanish electronic data bases  were search ed for relevant studies  published between 1995 and 2015 .  Eligible study design s included r and omized controlled trial , pre/post-test and quasi experimental methods . RESULTS Findings indicated that there was a dearth of literature reporting on GDM interventions for  Hispanic women  and just seven papers met inclusion criteria . These seven studies were included in the review and they reported on interventions for : ( 1 ) pregnant  women  at high risk of developing GDM ; ( 2 )  pregnant women with  GDM . Results suggest that a combination of intensive counselling over a prolonged period of time , together with a low calorie , possibly low glycemic index diet , produces best  results  .  The review found that  intensive nutritional counselling approaches  which promote low calorie/low GI diets appear to be most  effective  in  BGL management  in this population . Interventions that are delivered in Spanish and culturally tailored may be more  acceptable  to participants . More research is needed to develop suitable interventions to improve  GDM  management among Hispanic women."
"CBACKGROUND  Radical cystectomy ( RC )  represents the mainstay of treatment in  patients with muscle-invasive urinary bladder cancer  but how it compares with the best organ preservation approach is not known . MATERIAL S AND METHODS The objective of our review is to compare the 5-year overall survival ( OS ) rates from retrospective and prospect i ve studies of  RC  and  trimodality treatment ( TMT )  , i.e. concurrent delivery  of chemotherapy and radiotherapy  after a transurethral resection of bladder tumor ( TURBT ) , involving a  total of 10,265 and 3131 patients , respectively .  We used r and om-effect models to pool outcomes across studies and compared event rates of combined outcomes for  TMT and RC  using an interaction test . RESULTS The  median 5-year OS rate  was 57 % in the  TMT  group , when compared with 52 % ( P=0.04 ) , 51 % ( P=0.02 ) and 53 % ( P=0.38 ) in the whole group receiving  RC  or the group treated with  RC alone  or  RC+chemotherapy  , respectively . The  hazard risk ( HR ) of mortality  of patients treated with  TMT  or  RC  was 1.22 ( 95 % CI=1.13 - 1.32 ) with an absolute benefit of 5 % in favor of the former . The  HR of mortality from  TMT   persisted significantly better not only versus the group treated with  RC  alone ( HR=1.22 ; 95 % CI=1.12 - 1.32 ) , but also versus the group receiving  RC+chemotherapy  ( HR=1.22 ; 95 % CI=1.09 - 1.36 ) . Multivariate analysis confirmed  TMT  as a significant prognostic variable for both  RC  alone and  RC+chemotherapy .   Compared with  RC , TMT  seems to be associated with a better outcome for  patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) .  The addition of  chemotherapy  may improve the RC outcome in some subgroups of patients with a higher probability of micrometastases . Prospect i ve r and omized trials are urged to verify these findings and better define the role of organ preservation and radical treatment strategy in the management of patients with MIBC."
"eNon-alcoholic  fatty liver  disease ( NAFLD ) is a common comorbidity in  individuals with obesity .  Although multiple pharmacotherapeutics are in development , currently there are limited strategies specifically targeting NAFLD . This systematic review summarizes the existing literature on hepatic effects of medications used for weight loss .  Glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) agonists  are the best-studied in this regard , and evidence consistently demonstrates reduction in liver fat content , sometimes accompanied by improvements in  histological features of steatohepatitis  and reductions in  serum markers of hepatic injury such as alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) .  It remains unclear whether these benefits are independent of the weight loss caused by these agents . Literature is limited regarding effects of  orlistat  , but a small number of reports suggest that  orlistat  reduces  liver fat content  and improves  histologic features of NASH  , benefits which may also be driven primarily by  weight loss .  A sizeable body of literature on hepatic effects of  metformin  yields mixed results , with a probability of modest benefit , but no consistent signal for strong benefit . There are insufficient data on hepatic effects of  topiramate , phentermine , naltrexone , bupropion , and lorcaserin .  Finally , a few studies to date suggest that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors may reduce  liver fat content  and cause  modest reductions in ALT  , but further study is needed to better characterize these effects . Based on available data ,  GLP-1 agonists  have the strongest evidence base demonstrating beneficial effects on NAFLD , but it is not clear if any weight loss medication has effects on NAFLD superior to those of nutritional modification and exercise alone."

"sPurpose To assess the comparative efficacy of  short-acting muscarinic antagonists ( SAMAs ) , long-acting muscarinic antagonists ( LAMAs ) , LAMA in combination with long-acting beta-agonists ( LABAs ; LAMA/LABAs )  and  inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) in combination with LABA ( ICS/LABAs )  for the maintenance treatment of COPD . Material s and methods We systematic ally review ed  74 r and omized controlled trials ( 74,832 participants ) published up to 15 November 2017  , which compared any of the interventions  ( SAMA [ ipratropium ] , LAMA [ aclidinium , glycopyrronium , tiotropium , umeclidinium ] , LAMA/LABA [ aclidinium/formoterol , indacaterol/glycopyrronium , tiotropium/olo date rol , umeclidinium/vilanterol ] and ICS/LABA [ fluticasone/vilanterol , budesonide/formoterol , salmeterol/fluticasone ] ) with each other or with placebo .  A r and om-effects network meta- analysis combining direct and indirect evidence was conducted to examine the change from baseline in  trough FEV1 , transition dyspnea index , St George 's Respiratory Question naire and frequency of adverse events  at weeks 12 and 24 . Results Inconsistency models were not statistically significant for all outcomes .  LAMAs , LAMA/LABAs  and  ICS/LABAs  led to a significantly greater  improvement  in  trough FEV1  compared with placebo and SAMA monotherapy at weeks 12 and 24 . All  LAMA/LABAs  , except  aclidinium/formoterol  , were statistically significantly better than  LAMA  monotherapy and  ICS/LABAs  in  improving trough FEV1 .  Among the  LAMAs  , umeclidinium showed statistically significant improvement in  trough FEV1  at week 12 compared to tiotropium and glycopyrronium , but the results were not clinical ly significant .  LAMA/LABAs  had the highest probabilities of being ranked the best agents in  FEV1  improvement . Similar trends were observed for the  transition dyspnea index and St George 's Respiratory Question naire outcomes .  There were no significant differences in the incidences of  adverse events  among all treatment options . Conclusion  LAMA/LABA  showed the greatest improvement in  trough FEV1  at weeks 12 and 24 compared with the other inhaled drug classes , while SAMA showed the least improvement . There were no significant differences among the  LAMAs  and  LAMA/LABAs  within their respective classes."

 : Hyperthermia along with  radiotherapy  enhances the likelihood of CR in HNCs by around 25 % compared to  radiotherapy  alone with no significant additional acute and late morbidities . This level I evidence should justify the integration of hyperthermia into the multimodality therapy of HNCs.
" Combined inhaler therapy led to around a quarter fewer  COPD exacerbations  than were seen with  placebo .  A significant reduction in  all-cause mortality  was noted , but this outcome was dominated by one trial ( TORCH ) , emphasising the need for further trials of longer duration . Increased  risk of pneumonia  is a concern ; however , this did not translate into increased  exacerbations , hospitalisations or deaths .  Current evidence does not suggest any major differences between inhalers in terms of effects , but nor is the evidence strong enough to demonstrate that all are equivalent . To permit firmer conclusions about the effects of combined therapy , more data are needed , particularly in relation to the profile of adverse events and benefits in relation to different formulations and doses of inhaled ICS . Head-to-head comparisons are necessary to determine whether one combined inhaler is better than the others."

The Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s , and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , EMBASE , MEDLINE , CINAHL , and PsycINFO were search ed for  studies dating from January 2000 through to October 2016 .  Based on pre-determined selection criteria , data was extracted from eligible studies . Method ological quality of studies was assessed using an adapted version of the Cochrane Collaboration Back Review Group checklist . Results The literature search yielded  1766 studies of which only six RCTs fulfilled the eligibility criteria .  Although the content , duration , and frequency of interventions varied considerably across studies , commonly used elements included tailored information , education , self-management support , and communication with clinicians . Five studies measured  symptom distress  and four of them reported statistically significant differences between study groups . Of the three studies that measured  HRQOL  , two reported improvement ( or no deterioration over time ) for the intervention group . However , several method ological issues including high attrition rates , poor adherence to interventions , and use of non-vali date d measures affect confidence in the strength of evidence . Conclusion Despite the evidence in support of using the Internet as a worthwhile tool for effective patient engagement and self-management of chemotherapy-related symptoms outside clinic visits , method ological limitations in the evidence base require further well-planned and quality research."
">Objectives To conduct a systematic review of strategies to optimize immunisation uptake within  preschool children in developed countries .  Design Systematic review . Setting Developed countries  Participants Preschool children who were due , or overdue , one or more of their routine primary immunisations .  Main outcome measures  Increase in  the  proportion of the target population  up to date with st and ard recommended universal vaccinations . Results  Forty-six studies were included for analysis , published between 1980 and 2009 .  Twenty-six studies were r and omized controlled trials , 11 were before and after trials , and nine were controlled intervention trials . Parental reminders showed a statistically significant increase in  immunisation rates  in 34 % of included intervention arms . These effects were reported with both generic and specific reminders and with all methods of reminders and recall . Strategies aim ed at immunisation providers were also shown to improve  immunisation rates  with a median change in  immunisation rates  of 7 % when reminders were used , 8 % when educational programmes were used and 19 % when feedback programmes were used . Conclusion General practitioners are uniquely positioned to influence  parental decisions  on  childhood immunisation .  A variety of strategies studied in primary care setting s have been shown to improve  immunisation rates  , including  parental  and  healthcare provider reminders ."
"sBackground For decades , there is an unresolved debate about adequate prescription of  antibiotics  for  patients suffering from exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .  The aim of this systematic review was to analyse r and omised controlled trials investigating the clinical benefit of  antibiotics  for COPD exacerbations . Methods We conducted a systematic review of r and omised ,  placebo-controlled  trials assessing the effects of  antibiotics  on clinical ly relevant outcomes in  patients with an exacerbation .  We search ed bibliographic data bases , scrutinized reference lists and conference proceedings and asked the pharmaceutical industry for unpublished data . We used fixed-effects models to pool results . The primary outcome was  treatment failure of COPD exacerbation treatment .  Results  We included 13 trials ( 1557 patients ) of moderate to good quality .  For the effects of antibiotics on  treatment failure  there was much heterogeneity across all trials ( I2 = 82 % ) . Meta-regression revealed  severity of exacerbation  as significant explanation for this heterogeneity ( p = 0.016 ) :  Antibiotics  did not reduce  treatment failures  in out patients with mild to moderate exacerbations ( pooled odds ratio 1.09 , 95 % CI 0.75–1.59 , I2 = 18 % ) . In  patients with  severe exacerbations had a substantial benefit on  treatment failure rates  ( pooled odds ratio of 0.25 , 95 % CI 0.16–0.39 , I2 = 0 % ; number-needed to treat of 4 , 95 % CI 3–5 ) and on  mortality  ( pooled odds ratio of 0.20 , 95 % CI 0.06–0.62 , I2 = 0 % ; number-needed to treat of 14 , 95 % CI 12–30 ) . Conclusion  Antibiotics  effectively  reduce treatment failure and mortality rates  in  COPD patients with severe exacerbations .  For  patients with mild to moderate exacerbations  ,  antibiotics  may not be generally indicated and further research is needed to guide antibiotic prescription in these patients."
"  CRT  seems to be optimal for most  early stage ( I-II ) HD patients  . For advanced stages ( III-IV ) ,  CRT  better prevents  progression/relapse  but CT alone seems to cause  less SM .   RT  alone gives a  higher overall SM risk  than  CRT  due to increased need for  salvage therapy  . Reduced  SM risk  after  IF-RT  instead of  EF-RT  could not be demonstrated . Due to the large number of studies excluded because no IPD were received , to the inclusion of many out date d treatments and to the limited amount of long-term data , one must be cautious in applying these results to current therapies."
"  Trunk training exercises  , performed with either stable or unstable surface , could be a good rehabilitation strategy and might help improving  trunk performance and dynamic sitting balance  after stroke."
 Our findings showed a significant efficacy of  anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy  regarding  disease free survival  of breast cancer . As a limitation in this meta- analysis we used  studies with different types of anthracycline-based  regimens.

"yThe effectiveness of  medical nutrition therapy ( MNT )  in the management of diabetes has been well established ( 1 ) . Previous review s have provided comprehensive recommendations for  MNT  in the management of diabetes ( 2,3 ) . The goals of  MNT  are to 1 ) attain and maintain optimal  blood glucose levels  , a lipid and  lipoprotein profile  that reduces the risk of macrovascular disease , and blood pressure levels that reduce the risk for vascular disease ; 2 ) prevent and treat the chronic complications of diabetes by modifying nutrient intake and lifestyle ; 3 ) address individual nutrition needs , taking into account personal and cultural preferences and willingness to change ; and 4 ) maintain the pleasure of eating by only limiting food choices when indicated by scientific evidence ( 4 ) . The literature on nutrition as it relates to diabetes management is vast . We undertook the specific topic of the role of macronutrients , eating patterns , and individual foods in response to continued controversy over independent contributions of specific foods and macronutrients , independent of weight loss , in the management of diabetes . The position of the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) on  MNT  is that each person with diabetes should receive an individualized eating plan ( 4 ) . ADA has received numerous criticisms because it does not recommend one specific mix of macronutrients for everyone with diabetes . The previous literature review conducted by ADA in 2001 supported the idea that there was not one ideal macronutrient distribution for all people with diabetes . This review focuses on literature that has been published since that 2001 date ( 5 ) . This systematic review will be one source of information considered when updating the current ADA Nutrition Position Statement ( 4 ) . Other systematic review s and key research studies that may not be included in this review will also be considered . When attempting to tease out the role of macronutrients from other dietary."
 Most of the included RCTs reported no beneficial effects or harms of  LCPUFA  supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes of  formula-fed full-term infants  and no consistent beneficial effects on  visual acuity .  Routine supplementation of full-term infant milk formula with LCPUFA can not be recommended at this time.
"dBACKGROUND The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends that  mothers  practice  exclusive  breastfeeding ( EBF ) of their infants for 6 months . Various  breastfeeding support interventions  have been developed to encourage  mothers  to maintain breastfeeding practice s. Research aim : This study aims to review how effectively  breastfeeding support interventions  enable  mothers  to practice EBF for 6 months and to suggest the best intervention strategies . METHODS Six data bases were search ed , including MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane , CINAHL , PsycINFO , and KoreaMed . The authors independently extracted  data from journals written in English or Korean and published between January 2000 and August 2017 .  R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) reporting EBF until 6 months were screened . RESULTS A total of  27 RCTs  were review ed ,  and 36,051 mothers were included .  The effectiveness  of breastfeeding support interventions  to promote EBF for 6 months was significant ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.77 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.81 - 3.76 ) . A further subgroup analysis of intervention effects shows that a  baby friendly hospital initiative  (  BFHI )  intervention ( OR = 5.21 ; 95 % CI : 2.15 - 12.61 ) , a combined intervention ( OR = 3.56 ; 95 % CI : 1.74 - 7.26 ) , a professional provider led intervention ( OR = 2.76 ; 95 % CI : 1.76 - 4.33 ) , having a protocol available for the provider training program ( OR = 2.87 ; 95 % CI : 1.89 - 4.37 ) and implementation during both the prenatal and postnatal periods ( OR = 3.32 ; 95 % CI : 1.83 - 6.03 ) increased  the rate of EBF  for 6 months .  We suggest considering a multicomponent intervention as the primary strategy and implementing BFHI interventions within hospitals . Evidence indicates that  intervention effectiveness  increases when a protocol is available for provider training , when interventions are conducted from the pre- to postnatal period , when the hospital and community are connected , and when healthcare professionals are involved."
"dGraphical abstract Figure . No caption available . HighlightsMuch research has examined biomarkers of chronic stress in  dementia caregivers .  Cortisol was increased in  dementia caregivers  in most studies examining cortisol .  Dementia caregivers  displayed poorer attention and executive function performance .  Interventions to reduce stress  in  caregivers  may improve  cognition .  Risk of bias was generally low to moderate . & NA ; As the physiological impact of chronic stress is difficult to study in humans , naturalistic stressors are invaluable sources of information in this area . This review systematic ally evaluates the research literature examining biomarkers of chronic stress , including neurocognition , in  informal dementia caregivers .  We identified  151 papers for inclusion in the final review  , including papers examining differences between  caregivers and controls  as well as interventions aim ed at counteracting the biological burden of chronic caregiving stress . Results indicate that  cortisol  was increased in  caregivers  in a majority of studies examining this biomarker . There was mixed evidence for differences in  epinephrine , norepinephrine and other cardiovascular markers .  There was a high level of heterogeneity in  immune system measures .   Caregivers  performed more poorly on  attention and executive functioning tests .  There was mixed evidence for  memory performance .   Interventions to reduce stress  improved  cognition  but had mixed effects on  cortisol .  Risk of bias was generally low to moderate . Given the rising  need for family caregivers worldwide  , the implication s of these findings can no longer be neglected."
"sBackground  : Cholangiocarcinoma ( CC )  is the second most  primary liver malignancy  with increasing incidence in  Western countries .  Currently , surgical R0 resection is regarded as the only potentially curative treatment . The results of  systemic chemotherapy and best supportive care ( BSC )  in  patients with metastatic disease  are often disappointing in regard to  toxicity , oncologic efficacy , and overall survival .  In current practice , the use of different locoregional therapies is increasingly more accepted . Methods : A review of the literature on  locoregional therapies  for  intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC )  was undertaken . Results : There are no prospect i ve r and omized controlled trials . For localized ICC , either primary or recurrent ,  radiofrequency ablation ( RFA )  is by far the most commonly used thermal ablation modality . Thereby , a systematic review and meta- analysis reports  major complication  in 3.8 % as well as 1- , 3- , and 5-year  overall survival rates  of 82 , 47 , and 24 % , respectively . In  selected patients ( e.g. with a tumor diameter of ≤3 cm )   , oncologic efficacy and survival  after RFA are comparable with surgical resection . For diffuse ICC , different  transarterial therapies  , either  chemotherapy-based ( hepatic artery infusion ( HAI ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) )  or  radiotherapy-based ( transarterial radioembolization ( TARE ) )  , show extremely promising results . With regard to controlled trials ( transarterial therapy versus systemic chemotherapy , BSC or no treatment )  , tumor control  is virtually always better for transarterial therapies and very often accompanied by a  dramatic survival benefit and improvement of quality of life .  Of note , the latter is the case not only for  patients without extrahepatic metastatic disease  but also for those with  liver-dominant extrahepatic metastatic disease  . There are other locoregional therapies such as   microwave ablation  , irreversible  electroporation  , and chemosaturation  ; however , the current data support their use only in controlled trials or as last-line therapy . Conclusion : Dedicated locoregional therapies are commonly used for primary and recurrent ICC as well as liver-only and liver-dominant extrahepatic metastatic disease . Currently , the best evidence and most promising results are available for RFA , HAI , TACE , and TARE . In cohort studies ,  the overall survival rates  are similar to those obtained with surgery or systemic therapies . Prospect i ve r and omized controlled trials are warranted to compare  safety and efficacy  between different surgical  ,  interventional ,  and  systemic therapies , as well as their combinations."
"yINTRODUCTION The objective was to perform a systematic review of literature concerning epidemiology , clinical and biological data , prognosis and therapy of  sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas .  MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on  sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas  have been sought by querying the server Medline with MeSH terms following or combination of them : "" renal carcinoma "" , "" renal cell carcinoma , "" "" renal cancer "" , "" sarcomatoid "" "" sarcomatoid transformation "" and "" sarcomatoid differentiation . "" The articles obtained were selected according to their methodology , the language in English or French , the relevance and the date of publication .  Twenty papers were selected .  RESULTS According to the literature , a sarcomatoid contingent can be observed in all subtypes of  renal cell carcinomas  , with a frequency of 1 to 15 % of cases .  The median age at diagnosis was 60 years with a majority of symptomatic patients ( 90 % ) , mainly with abdominal pain and hematuria .  These tumors were often found in  patients with locally advanced or metastatic ( 45 - 77 % ) .  The imaging was not specific for the diagnosis and biopsy had a low sensitivity for identifying a sarcomatoid contingent . The treatment was based on a combination of  maximal surgical resection  whenever  possible  and  systemic therapy  for  metastastic  disease . Pathological data often showed  large tumors  ,  Furhman  4 grade s , combined biphasic carcinomatous contingent ( clear cell carcinoma in most cases ) and sarcomatoid  .  Genetically , there was no  specific abnormality  but a  complex association of chromosomal additions and deletions .  The prognosis was pejorative with a  specific median survival  of 5 to 19 months without any impact of the sarcomatoid contingent rate .  Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is a form not to ignore despite its rarity . Mainly symptomatic and discovered at an advanced stage , it has a poor prognosis , requiring multidisciplinary management quickly and correctly."
"tThe magnitude of treatment effect can be assessed by a number of methods . One method of collectively analysing data is that used by the Cochrane Collaboration . Their systematic review s identify , analyse and present research -based evidence in an accessible format . These review s may contain meta-analyses combining data from multiple studies to provide robust evaluations of overall treatment effects . In 2003 ,  Cochrane  review s  of data for treatment with  corticosteroids  in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF )  found no evidence supporting their use ; similarly , review s of  immunomodulatory agents  found very little evidence to support their use . A recent up date of these Cochrane review s failed to identify any evidence supporting the use of  corticosteroids  in IPF ; however , a review of  non-steroid agents  in the treatment of IPF identified 15 clinical trials suitable for analysis . Two trials of  interferon-γ-1b  were combined , and  no treatment  effect was observed in terms  of survival  . Two Japanese trials of treatment with  pirfenidone  were combined , and a positive  effect  of  pirfenidone on pulmonary function decline  was observed . Meta- analysis of three phase III studies suggested that pirfenidone significantly  increased progression-free survival  by 30 % . The findings of this systematic review , although not presenting new original data , together with an  acceptable safety profile  , suggest that pirfenidone may have a role in IPF treatment."
"lPURPOSE To systematic ally review the method ologic quality of , and summarize the evidence from trials examining the effectiveness of  physical exercise  in improving the level of physical  functioning  and psychological well-being of  cancer patients during and after medical treatment .  METHODS  Thirty-four r and omized clinical trials ( RCTs ) and  controlled clinical trials were identified , review ed for substantive results , and assessed for method ologic quality . RESULTS Four of 34  trials  met all ( seven of seven ) method ologic criteria on the Delphi criteria list . Failure to conceal the sequencing of treatment allocation before patient recruitment , failure to blind the outcome assessor , and failure to employ an intention-to-treat analysis strategy were the most prevalent method ologic shortcomings . Various  exercise  modalities have been applied , differing in content , frequency , intensity , and duration . Positive results have been observed for a diverse set of outcomes , including  physiologic measures , objective performance indicators , self-reported functioning and symptoms , psychological well-being , and overall health-related quality of life .   The trials review ed were of moderate method ologic quality . Together they suggest that  cancer patients  may benefit from  physical exercise  both during and after treatment . However , the specific beneficial effects of  physical exercise  may vary as a function of the stage of disease , the nature of the medical treatment , and the current lifestyle of the patient . Future RCTs should use larger sample s , use appropriate comparison groups to rule out the possibility of an attention-placebo effect , use a comparable set of outcome measures , pay greater attention to issues of motivation and adherence of patients participating in  exercise programs  , and examine the effect of  exercise  on cancer survival."
"dPURPOSE For  emerging adults with chronic medical diseases  , the transition from pediatric to adult health care is often a time of great upheaval , commonly associated with unhealthy self-management choices , loss to follow-up , and adverse outcomes . We conducted a systematic review to examine the use of  incentive strategies  to promote positive  health-related behaviors  in  young adults with chronic medical diseases .  METHODS The Medline , CINAHL , Embase , PsycInfo , and Cochrane data bases were search ed through June 2014 . Studies of any design where an  incentive  was used to achieve a target behavior or outcome in a  pediatric or emerging adult population ( age < 30 years ) with chronic medical conditions including addictions  , were included . RESULTS  A total of 26 studies comprising 10,880 patients met our inclusion criteria after screening 10,305 abstract s and 301 full-text articles .  Of these studies , 20 examined the  effects of  behavioral incentives  on cigarette smoking or substance abuse , including alcohol ;  four studies explored  behavioral incentives  in the setting of HIV or sexual health ; and two articles studied individuals with other chronic medical conditions . Seventeen articles reported a  statistically significant benefit of the  behavioral incentive   on one or more outcomes , although only half reported follow-up after the incentive period was terminated .  While the majority of studies reported positive outcomes , these studies focused on promoting the cessation of  adverse  behaviors rather than promoting positive behaviors . In addition , conclusions were limited by the high risk of bias present in the majority of studies , as well as lack of follow-up after the incentive period . Whether  behavioral incentives  facilitate the  adoption of positive health choices  in this population remains to be determined."
"eThe objective of this study was to determine the effect , if any , on  survival  of  adjuvant 5-FU-based  chemoradiotherapy  following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic carcinoma .  A systematic review of the published literature was undertaken .  Survival  estimates were derived from published reports .  Five prospect i ve studies ( 4 level I , 1 level II ) with a total of 607 ( 229 surgery only ; 378 surgery- adjuvant ) patients followed for survival  met selection criteria .  Two-year survival  ranged from 15%–37 % in the surgery only group and 37%–43 % in the surgery and adjuvant groups .  The survival advantage  ( absolute difference ) ranged from 3%–27 % and no individual study achieved statistical significance ( 5 % ) . Although clinical heterogeneity existed in surgery-alone control groups with regard to trial date , no statistical heterogeneity was detected ( P = 0.459 , χ2 test ) , allowing pooling of survival data . Using a fixed effects model , the summary estimate showed an  absolute 2-year survival benefit   with adjuvant therapy  of 12 % ( 95 % CI , 3%–21 % , P = 0.011 ) . Trials after 1997 ( n = 3 ) indicated  a survival benefit  of 8 % to patients  receiving adjuvant therapy  ( 95 % CI , −3–18 % , P = 0.145 ) . The result was not statistically significant , and there was no evidence of heterogeneity ( P = 0.626 , χ2 test ) . Summary estimates were unchanged when the analysis was performed with a r and om effects model  . 5-FU based chemotherapy with radiotherapy  given after resection imparts a  small overall survival benefit  of 2 years . The  benefit of 5FU-based adjuvant therapy  , however , has declined in recent years , and its significance remains unproven in the context of current diagnostic and surgical practice."
"tThe aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the best available evidence informing the effectiveness of  non-pharmacological interventions  for managing   cancer-related fatigue  in men treated for prostate cancer .  This review considered experimental studies that included  men with prostate cancer ( regardless of staging , previous treatment or comorbidities ) , aged 18 years and over who were undergoing any treatment , or had completed any treatment for prostate cancer within the previous 12 months .  Three interventions were identified for the management of  cancer-related fatigue  in  men  with prostate cancer  .  Evidence from  five studies including 447 participants  demonstrates the effectiveness of  physical activity  , both  aerobic  and  resistance exercise  , and from  three studies including 153 participants  suggesting the benefits of  psychosocial interventions  including  education and cognitive behavioural therapy .  Health professionals require knowledge of a range of effective interventions aim ed at reducing   cancer-related fatigue  in men with prostate cancer  and should incorporate those interventions into their patient management . Although physical activity appears to show the greatest benefit , other  non-pharmacological interventions  such as  education and cognitive behavioural therapy  have demonstrated benefit and should also be considered as a strategy in treating this debilitating side effect of cancer and its treatment."

"sABSTRACT Background : Music is affordable and easily integrated in rehabilitation exercises , and has demonstrated different effects on the brain . We hypothesized that  music interventions  could improve rehabilitation outcomes after  stroke .  Objective : the aim of our review is to determine the effectiveness of different types  of music interventions  according to the rehabilitation objectives after stroke . Method : A systematic review of r and omized controlled trials , clinical controlled trials and cross-over design performed on PubMed and PEDro in May 2018 . All of these studies focus on acute , sub-acute or chronic stroke rehabilitation  with music or rhythmic auditory stimulation intervention  in adults during clinical outcomes . Two independent review ers extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias before bringing it together . Results :  Twenty-seven studies were included and analyzed .  Our review found positive effects on  physical status ( upper-limb activity ; gait parameters , balance ) , on cognition ( neglect , attention , communication ) and mood .  The analysis of the quality of the evidence showed that a majority of the studies had a high risk of bias . Conclusion : Focusing on high to moderate level evidence , our review highlighted that rhythmic auditory stimulation has a positive effect on  gait and balance ;  that  receptive  music  therapy  improves  mood  as well as some  cognitive functions ;  that there is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness  of active music therapy and melodic intonation therapy .  High- quality trials with large sample s would be necessary to further assess and /or recommend these interventions."

"nWe conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to evaluate the effects of  acupuncture  on  malignancy-related ,  chemotherapy (CT)- or radiation therapy (RT)-induced  ,  surgery-induced  , and  hormone therapy  (HT)-induced pain .  R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) examining the effects of  acupuncture  on  cancer-related pain  were reached from the EMBASE , PubMed , PsycINFO , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , CINAHL , Airiti library , Taiwan Electrical Periodical Service , Wanfang Data ( a  Chinese  data base ) and  China  Knowledge Re  source Integrated  Data base from inception through June 2014 . Heterogeneity , moderator analysis , publication bias and risk of bias associated with the included studies were examined . A  total of 29 RCTs yielding 36 effect sizes were included .  The overall  effect  of   acupuncture   on  cancer-related pain  was -0.45 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = -0.63 to -0.26 ] . The sub analysis indicated that  acupuncture  relieved  malignancy-related and surgery-induced pain  [ effect size ( g ) = -0.71 , and -0.40 ; 95 % CI = -0.94 to -0.48 , and -0.69 to -0.10 ] but not  CT-  or RT-induced and  HT-induced pain  ( g = -0.05 , and -0.64 , 95 % CI = -0.33 to 0.24 , and -1.55 to 0.27 ) .  Acupuncture  is effective in relieving  cancer-related pain  , particularly malignancy-related and surgery-induced pain . Our findings suggest that  acupuncture  can be adopted as part of a multimodal approach for reducing cancer-related pain."
"eOBJECTIVE To examine whether   religious and spiritual interventions ( RSIs )   can promote physical health and  quality  of  life in individuals .  METHODS The following data bases were used to conduct a systematic review : PubMed , Scopus , Web of Science , EMBASE , PsycINFO , Cochrane , and Scielo . R and omized controlled trials that evaluated  RSIs  regarding  physical health outcomes and  /or  quality of life in English , Spanish or Portuguese  were included .  RSI  protocol s performed at a distance ( i.e. intercessory prayer ) or for psychiatric disorders were excluded . This study consisted of two phases : ( a ) reading titles and abstract s , and ( b ) assessing the full articles and their method ological quality using the Cochrane Back Review Group scale . RESULTS In total ,  7,070 articles were identified in the search , but 6884 were excluded in phase 1  because they were off topic or repeated in data bases .  Among the 186 articles included in phase 2 , 140 were excluded because they did not fit the inclusion criteria and 16 did not have adequate r and omization process .  Thus ,  a final selection of 30 articles remained  . The participants of the selected studies were classified in three groups :  chronic patients ( e.g.  ,  cancer , obesity , pain )  ,  healthy  individuals and  healthcare professionals  . The outcomes assessed included  quality of life , physical activity , pain , cardiac outcomes , promotion of health behaviors , clinical practice of healthcare professionals and satisfaction with protocol s.  The divergence concerning scales and protocol s proposed did not allow a meta- analysis .  RSIs  as a psychotherapy approach were performed in 40 % of the studies , and the control group was more likely to use an  educational intervention  ( 56.7 % ) . The results revealed  small effect sizes favoring   RSIs   in quality of life and pain outcomes  and very  small effects sizes  in physical  activity  ,  promotion of health  behaviors and  clinical practice  of  health  professionals compared with other complementary strategies . Other outcomes , such as  cardiac measures and satisfaction with the protocol s  , revealed no evidence for  RSIs  . Regarding the quality of the selected articles according to the Cochrane Back Review Group Scale , the average score was 6.83 ( SD = 9.08 ) on a scale of 11 , demonstrating robustness in the studies .  Clinical trials on  RSIs  demonstrated that they had small benefits compared with other complementary health therapies by reducing pain and weight , improving quality of life and promoting health behaviors . The lack of clinical trials that included biological outcomes and the diversity of approaches indicate a need for more studies to underst and the possible mechanisms of action of  RSIs  and their roles in health care."
" The evidence is insufficient to recommend  acupuncture  for the treatment or prevention of cipn . Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of  acupuncture  in the treatment of cipn . Given that  acupuncture  is considered safe and might provide relief for patients , it can be considered at the clinician 's discretion."
"eObjective : Retraining of sensory function following  stroke  is frequently overlooked in rehabilitation protocol s despite more than 60 % of patients presenting with sensory deficits . Methods to train sensory function include both  passive and active training protocol  s. Here we examined the volume and quality of the evidence available for both  passive and active sensory training  following stroke . In addition , we aim ed to quantify the effect of sensory training on impairment and function . Data sources : Data bases search ed included MEDLINE , AMED , CINAHL , Academic search elite , Scopus and the Cochrane library . Unpublished articles were identified using a search engine . Review methods : Studies utilizing  passive or active sensory training paradigms  post stroke were identified . Method  ological quality  was examined using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence and the McMaster University critical appraisal tool . Results :  Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria ;  8 examined  passive  and 6  active sensory training .  Method  ological quality scores  ranged from 11 to 18.5 ( maximum 20 ) . Meta- analysis was performed using three studies examining  h and function  , demonstrating a moderate effect in favour of  passive sensory training .  Other studies were unable to be pooled due to heterogeneity of measures or insufficient data . Conclusion : Meta-analyses and single studies offer some support for the effectiveness of   passive sensory training   in relation to  sensory impairment  and motor  function  . However , empirical evidence for  active sensory training  is limited . Further high- quality studies with greater statistical power and meaningful clinical measures are required in order to accurately determine the effectiveness of sensory retraining following stroke."
">Abstract Background  Somatosensory stimulation  may have a positive impact on  recovery  of  motor function  by maintaining cortical representation of the h and and acting to prime the motor system for movement . Objective Determine the  efficacy  of  somatosensory stimulation  on  upper limb motor function  after  stroke .  Methods  Five electronic data bases ( MEDLINE  , CINAHL , Embase , PEDro and OT Seeker ) were search ed from inception  to October 2016 . Included studies were English- language r and omized controlled trials  where a  sensory intervention  was  applied below the elbow  to improve  upper  limb motor control  of adults after stroke .  One outcome needed to measure arm function at an impairment or activity level . Study selection and quality assessment ( using the PEDro scale ) were independently conducted by two review ers . Meta- analysis was completed where there was sufficient homogeneity between trials . Results  Fifteen articles were included reporting data from 14 r and omized controlled trials ( 627 participants ) .  There was low- quality evidence from four trials that  sensory electrical stimulation did not improve upper limb activity  compared to placebo ( SMD 0.4 , 95%CI −0.07 to 0.87 , I2 38 % ) and moderate- quality evidence from three trials that it did  not improve motor impairment  ( MD 3.45 units , 95%CI −1.47 to 8.36 , I2 35 % ) . Low- quality evidence from two trials demonstrated that therapist-delivered sensory stimulation  did not improve upper limb activity  ( SMD 0.25 , 95%CI −0.20 to 0.69 , I2 0 % ) compared to usual care . Conclusion Current low- to moderate- quality evidence suggests  somatosensory stimulation  is not  effective  in  improving upper limb motor impairment or activity  after  stroke ."
"e& NA ; Figure . No Caption available . BACKGROUND : New or worsening  sleep‐wake disturbance ( SWD )  can occur throughout the cancer trajectory . OBJECTIVES : The purpose of this article is to critically review available empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of interventions for  SWD  , highlighting new evidence since the 2006 and 2009 Putting Evidence Into Practice ( PEP ) SWD publications . METHODS : A systematic review of studies published from 2009‐2017 was conducted to identify effective interventions for cancer‐related  SWD  . The PEP weight of evidence classification schema was used to categorize the strength of evidence . FINDINGS  : Cognitive behavioral intervention/approach  is the only intervention that is recommended for practice .   Mindfulness‐based stress reduction and exercise  interventions  are likely to be effective but require more evidence  . Pharmacologic interventions , relaxation , imagery , meditation , acupuncture , yoga , massage , and psychoeducation  have insufficient evidence."
 Limited evidence indicates potential benefits of  elemental nutrition  against no intervention in the maintenance of  remission  and prevention  of relapse  in  adult patients with CD .  There was a lack or insufficient evidence on  adverse events and complications  . Future large and long-term r and omised trials are warranted to draw more definitive conclusions regarding the effects of  elemental nutrition  in maintaining remission in CD .

"sThe  total cost  of RA is substantial , particularly in  patients with high levels of disability .  There are considerable differences in cost between countries , driven in part by differences in the use of  biologic therapies .  Economic evaluations are needed to assess the extra cost of using these treatments and the benefits obtained , to ensure appropriate allocation of limited health care re sources . The BeSt trial , evaluating four treatment strategies , found comparable  medium-term efficacy  but substantially higher  costs  with early  biologic therapy .  A systematic review of such  cost-effectiveness  analyses concluded that  biologic therapy  should be used after therapy has failed with less costly alternatives such as  synthetic DMARDs and glucocorticoids .  Optimizing such relatively low-cost therapy to improve outcomes may delay the need for biologic therapy , thereby saving costs . A simple model has confirmed the value of this approach . The addition  of modified-release prednisone 5 mg/day to existing synthetic DMARD therapy  in  patients with active disease  result ed in  improvement in DAS-28  to below the threshold level for initiation of  reimbursed biologic therapy  in 28 - 34 % of patients . On a conservative estimate ( i.e. assuming no further benefits beyond the 12 weeks of the study and a 12-week wait- and -see approach to starting  biologic therapy   ) , cost savings  amounted to nearly € 400 per patient . While treatment decisions should never be based only on cost considerations , prolonging disease control by optimizing the use of  non-biologic treatments  may bring benefits to patients and also economic benefits by delaying the need for biologic treatments."
" This systematic review synthesized the findings of  seven studies that  captured the  experiences of women with gynecological cancer who received care from a  specialist nurse .   The specialist nurse offers tailored , accessible and expert care to  women with gynecological cancer .  From the synthesis it is recommended that  women with gynecological cancer  have access to the services of a specialist nurse at key points on the continuum of care , that specialist nurses provide information to patients on their disease and treatment in the form preferred by the patient and ensure that this information has been understood , and that specialist nurses are afforded time to spend with patients to enable greater exploration and identification of patient needs and the provision of personalized care . Further study that considers other key stakeholders in the specialist nurse role in gynecological oncology is recommended in order to gain a full underst and ing of specialist nurses ’ contribution to the care of  women with gynecological cancer .  Additionally , it is recommended that further studies be conducted to seek the perspectives of  women with gynecological cancer  from culturally and linguistically diverse background s and Indigenous population s on specialist nursing care as they appear to be under-represented in current research."

" A single dose of an  anticholinergic agent  is not effective for the treatment of mild and moderate exacerbations and is insufficient for the treatment of severe exacerbations . Adding multiple doses of  anticholinergics to beta2 agonists   appears safe , improves lung function  and would  avoid hospital admission  in 1 of 12 such treated patients . Although multiple doses should be preferred to single doses of  anticholinergics  , the available evidence only supports their use in  school-aged children with severe asthma exacerbation .  There is no conclusive evidence for using multiple doses of  anticholinergics  in  children  with mild or moderate exacerbations."
"tIn the central nervous system  omega-3 fatty acids  modulate cell signaling and affect dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways . On this basis , a new application for  omega-3 fatty acids  has been proposed , concerning the treatment of several  psychiatric disorders .  The present article is an up date of a previous systematic review and is aim ed to provide a complete report of data published in the period between 1980 and 2019 on  efficacy  and  tolerability  of  omega-3 fatty acids  in  psychiatric disorders .  In July 2019 , an electronic search on PUBMED , Medline and PsychINFO of all RCTs ,  systematic review  s and  meta-analyses  on  omega-3 fatty acids  and psychiatric disorders without any filter or MESH restriction was performed . After eligibility processes ,  the final number of records included in this review was 126 . One hundred and two of these studies were RCTs , while 24 were review s and meta-analyses .  The role of  omega-3 fatty acids  was studied in  schizophrenia , major depression , bipolar disorder , anxiety disorders , obsessive-compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , autism spectrum disorders , eating disorders , substance use disorder and borderline personality disorder .  The main evidence of the  efficacy  of  omega-3 fatty acids  has been obtained in treating  depressive symptoms  in  patients with major depression  and , to a lesser degree ,  bipolar depression .  Some  efficacy  was also found in early phases of schizophrenia in addition to antipsychotic treatment , but not in the chronic phases of psychosis .  Small beneficial effects of  omega-3 fatty  acids  were observed in  ADHD  and positive  results  were reported in a few trials on  core symptoms of borderline personality disorder .  For other psychiatric disorders results are inconsistent."

"nWe provide a systematic review to support the European Palliative Care Research Collaboration development of clinical guidelines for  cancer patients suffering from cachexia .  CENTRAL , MEDLINE , PsycINFO , Clinical Trials.gov , and a selection of cancer journals have been search ed up until 15 April 2016 . The systematic literature research yielded  4214 publications with 21 of these included in the final evaluation .  Regarding minerals , our search identified only one study examining the use of  magnesium  with no effect on weight loss . As far as vitamins are concerned ,  vitamin E in combination with omega-3 fatty acids  displayed an effect on  survival  in a single study ,  vitamin D  showed improvement of  muscle weakness  in prostate cancer patients , and  vitamin C supplementation  led to an improvement of various  quality of life aspects  in a sample with a variety of cancer diagnoses . For proteins , a  combination therapy  of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate ( HMB ) , arginine , and glutamine showed an increase in  lean body mass  after 4 weeks in a study of advanced solid tumour patients , whereas the same combination did not show a benefit on  lean body mass  in a large sample of advanced lung and other cancer patients after 8 weeks . L-carnitine led to an increase of  body mass index  and an  increase in overall survival  in advanced pancreatic cancer patients .  Adverse  effects of food supplementation were rare and showed mild intensity . There is not enough solid evidence for the use of  minerals , vitamins , proteins  , or other supplements in cancer . No  serious adverse effects  have been reported with dietary supplementation."
"nBACKGROUND Accumulating evidence from animal and human studies suggests that  vitamin D  is involved in many functions of the reproductive system in both genders . AIM The aim of this review was to provide an overview on the effects of  vitamin D  on  polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) in women and  and rogen metabolism in  men  . METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed for  relevant English language publications published from January 2012 until September 2017 .  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The vitamin D receptor and vitamin D-metabolizing enzymes are found in reproductive tissues of women and men . In women ,   vitamin  D status  has been associated with several features of  PCOS  . In detail , cross-sectional data suggest a regulatory role of  vitamin  D in PCOS-related aspects such as  ovulatory dysfunction , insulin resistance as well as hyper and rogenism .  Moreover , results from r and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) suggest that  vitamin D supplementation  may be beneficial for  metabolic , endocrine and fertility aspects  in PCOS . In men , vitamin D status has been associated with and rogen  levels  and  hypogonadism .  Further , there is some evidence for a favorable effect of  vitamin D  supplementation on  testosterone concentrations  , although others failed to show a significant effect on  testosterone levels .   In summary ,  vitamin D  deficiency is associated with  adverse fertility outcomes  including  PCOS and hypogonadism  , but the evidence is insufficient to establish causality . High- quality RCTs are needed to further evaluate the effects of  vitamin D  supplementation  in PCOS women  as well as on and rogen levels in men."
 There is evidence of moderate to very low quality to suggest that  supportive interventions to improve nutritional care  results in  minimal weight gain .  Most of the evidence for the lower risk of  all-cause mortality  for  supportive interventions  comes from hospital-based trials and more research is needed to confirm this effect . There is very low- quality evidence regarding adverse effects ; therefore whilst some of these interventions are advocated at a national level clinicians should recognise the lack of clear evidence to support their role . This review highlights the importance of assessing patient-important outcomes in future research.
 There is some evidence to recommend the use of  mental practice  for  procedural learning  in medical education . There is limited evidence to conclude that  terminal feedback  is more  effective  than concurrent feedback on a transfer test . For the remaining parameters that were review ed there was insufficient evidence to make definitive recommendations.
" Current evidence from r and omised trials suggests no clear benefit or harm associated with any of interventions on  risks of hospitalisation , duration of hospitalisation or death .  Further research with the primary aim to reduce  hospitalisation  in people with dementia is required."
" We found only very limited data from one small unblinded trial on the effects of high-volume feeds on important outcomes for preterm or low birth weight infants . The quality of evidence is low to very low . Hence , available evidence is insufficient to support or refute high-volume enteral feeds in preterm or low birth weight infants . A large , pragmatic r and omised controlled trial is needed to provide data of sufficient quality and precision to inform policy and practice."
"  MP  is  effective  when used in conjunction with conventional physical therapy for  functional rehabilitation  of both upper and lower limbs , as well as for the  recovery of daily activities and skills .  Owing to the heterogeneity of the studies with regard to the intervention protocol , specific imagery technique , time spent practicing , patient characteristics , etc . , more studies are needed in order to determine the optimal treatment protocol and patient profile."
"8Background : Optimizing  linear growth in children during complementary feeding period ( CFP ) ( 6 - 24 months )  are critical for their development . Several interventions , such  as micronutrient and food supplements , deworming , maternal education , and water , sanitation and hygiene ( WASH )  , could potentially be provided to prevent stunting , but their comparative effectiveness is currently unclear . In this study , we evaluated comparative effectiveness of interventions under these domains on   child  linear growth outcomes of  height-for-age z-score ( HAZ ) and stunting ( HAZ  < -2SD )  Methods : For this study , we search ed for  low- and middle-income country (LMIC)-based r and omized  clinical trials  (  RCTs ) of aforementioned interventions provided to  children during CFP .  We search ed for reports published until  September 17 , 2019  and h and - search ed bibliographies of existing review s. We performed r and om-effects network meta- analysis ( NMA ) for HAZ and stunting . Results : The evidence base for our NMA was based on  79 RCTs ( 96 papers ) involving 81,786 children .  Among the micronutrients , compared to st and ard-of-care  , iron + folic acid ( IFA )  ( mean difference = 0.08 ; 95 % credible interval [ CrI ] : 0.01 , 0.15 ) and  multiple micronutrients ( MMN  ) ( mean difference = 0.06 ; 95%CrI : 0.01 , 0.11 ) showed  improvements for HAZ ;  MMN also reduced  the risks for stunting  ( RR=0.86 ; 95%Crl : 0.73 , 0.98 ) , whereas IFA did not ( RR=0.92 ; 95%Crl : 0.64 , 1.23 ) . For food supplements , flour in the caloric range of 270 - 340 kcal ( RR=0.73 ; 95%Crl : 0.51 , 1.00 ) and  fortified lipid-based nutrient supplements ( LNS )  containing 220 - 285 kcal ( RR=0.80 ; 95%Crl : 0.66 , 0.97 ) decreased  the risk of stunting  compared to st and ard-of-care , but these interventions and other food supplements did not show  improvements for HAZ .  Deworming  ,  maternal education , and WASH interventions did not show  improvements for HAZ nor stunting .  Conclusion : While we found  micronutrient and food supplements  to be  effective for HAZ  and /or stunting , the evidence base for other domains in this life stage was limited , highlighting the need for more investigation .

">Poor inhaler technique and  inferior asthma outcomes  are evident in  older adults .  Review s comparing  metered dose inhaler ( MDI ) and dry powder inhaler ( DPI )  techniques across  older adults and younger cohorts  are scarce . This systematic review aim ed to determine whether differences exist between such cohorts with regards to the number and type of MDI and DPI errors made . A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase , Medline and PubMed from July 1 to December 31 , 2016 . Studies were selected in accordance with preset inclusion criteria , relevant data were extracted , and quality was assessed with vali date d checklists .  14 studies were identified .  Evidence suggests a negative correlation between advancing age and correct technique across MDI and varying DPI devices when examined collectively . Differences appear to exist between older  adult  and younger cohorts prescribed MDIs in  error types .  There is evidence of age-associated differences in the  number and type of inhaler technique errors .  Further research is required to assess outcomes in  individual DPIs  , reproducibility and the  effects  of  confounders ."

"sObesity is a growing chronic health problem worldwide . Studies about  acupuncture  for obesity treatment are many . But there are some doubts about the effectiveness of  acupuncture versus sham acupuncture  in treating obesity due to its lack of medical evidence . Therefore , the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of  acupuncture  for obesity treatment and provide clinic evidence .  Four English data bases ( PubMed , EMBASE , Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ) and four Chinese data bases ( China National Knowledge Infrastructure , Chinese BioMedical Data base , Chinese Scientific Journal Data base and Wan-Fang Data )  were search ed from their receptions to August 2019 . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) using the comparison between  acupuncture and sham acupuncture  to treat simple obesity were included . The primary outcome of  body mass index ( BMI )  would be used to measure the  effect of  acupuncture  on obesity .  According to the trial data extraction form based on the Cochrane H and book , two review ers separately extracted the data . Risk of bias of the RCTs was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool . The study  included 8 RCTs with 403 patients .  When compared with  sham acupuncture , acupuncture  showed obviously effect in  BMI reduction  ( MD=1.0kg/m2 , 95 % CI=0.6 to 1.4 , P<0.001 ) . There was also significant  reduction in body weight  ( MD=1.85 kg , 95%CI=0.82 to 2.88 , p<0.001 ) ,  WC  ( MD=0.97 cm , 95%CI=0.24 to 1.71 , p=0.01 ) and  body fat mass percentage  ( MD=1.01 , 95%CI=0.25 to 1.77 , p<0.05 ) . However ,  WHR  ( MD=0.01 , 95%CI=0 to 0.03 , p>0.05 ) was not statistically and significantly different between the acupuncture and control groups .  Adverse effects  were reported in 3 studies . The review suggests that  acupuncture  is an effective therapy for simple obesity rather than a placebo effect . This potential benefit needs to be further evaluated by longer-term and more rigorous RCTs."
">Previous review s have specifically looked at  computer-based  or  Internet-based approaches .  However , there has been no systematic review focused upon  electronic communication based interventions  for  hazardous young drinkers .

Eight papers delivered  interventions using the Web  , three implemented  text messaging  , one used a  mobile phone app  and the remaining paper used  a social networking site .  The ability to provide personalized electronic feedback result ed in a  reduction in alcohol consumption , frequency of binge drinking , and drinking in a non-risky way .  However , intervention length did not appear to have an impact on overall  effectiveness .

"  Seven included trials  evaluated  neck dissection surgery  in  patients with oral cavity cancers .  The review found weak evidence that  elective neck dissection  of clinical ly negative neck nodes at the time of removal of the primary tumour results in reduced  locoregional recurrence  , but there is insufficient evidence to conclude that  elective neck dissection  increases  overall survival or disease free survival  compared to  therapeutic neck dissection .  There is very weak evidence from one trial that  elective supraomohyoid neck dissection  may be associated with increased  overall and disease free survival .  There is no evidence that  radical neck dissection  increases  overall survival  compared to  conservative neck dissection surgery .  Reporting of  adverse events  in all trials was poor and it was not possible to compare the  quality of life  of patients undergoing different surgeries."
"gObjective : To collate and appraise empirical evidence relating to the effects of  verbal instructions ( verbal comm and s given by another person )  on  stride length  ,  gait velocity  and  stride variability  in  people with Parkinson ’s disease .  Data sources : Cinahl , Cochrane , Embase , Medline , PEDro , PsycINFO and Web of Science . Review methods : Independent review ers extracted data from eligible studies and assessed method ological quality . The level of evidence was determined by best evidence synthesis based upon the experimental design , method ological quality and statistical findings of individual studies . Results :  One r and omized controlled study and 12 non-controlled studies fulfilled  the  selection criteria and involved 149 participants .  Five types of  verbal instructions  were examined which included  ‘ take big steps  ’ ,  ‘ walk fast ’  ,  ‘ swing arms when walking ’  ,  ‘ count rhythm when walking  ’ and  ‘ walk fast with big steps  ’ . Best evidence synthesis found indicative evidence in support of the use of the instruction to take  big steps  in walking training for  stride length improvement  in  people with mild to moderate Parkinson ’s disease who are without cognitive impairment .  There was insufficient evidence in support of effects on  gait velocity and stride variability .  There was also insufficient evidence in support of effects of other instructions on any of the  gait variables .  Conclusion : The empirical evidence in support of the benefits from  verbal instructions  is weak . The evidence is limited to  short-term stride length improvement  from the use of the instruction to take  big steps  in walking training."
"  Women with PCOS  had a greater risk  of overweight , obesity and central obesity .  Although our findings support a positive association between obesity and PCOS , our conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity between studies and further studies are now required to determine the source of this heterogeneity . Clinical management of PCOS should include the prevention and management of overweight and obesity."
"dHuman  milk  is the natural nutrition for all  infants .  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics , it is the preferred choice of feeding for all infants ( 1 ) . The goals of Healthy People 2010 for  breastfeeding  are an initiation rate of 75 % and continuation rate of 50 % at 6 months and 25 % at 12 months after delivery ( 2 ) . A  survey of U.S. children in 2002  indicated that only  71 % had ever been breastfed  , and the percentage of  infants who continue to be breastfed  to some extent is 35 % at 6 months and 16 % at 12 months ( 3 ) . Although the breastfeeding initiation rate is close to the goal set by Healthy People 2010 , according to this survey , the breastfeeding continuation rates at 6 and 12 months fall short . Evidence suggests that breastfeeding decreases risks for many  diseases  in  infants and mothers .  In  children  , breastfeeding has been associated with a reduction in the  risk for acute otitis media , nonspecific gastroenteritis , severe lower respiratory tract infections , atopic dermatitis , childhood leukemia , and the sudden infant death syndrome .  In mothers , a history of lactation has been associated with a reduced risk for  type 2 diabetes and breast and ovarian cancer  ( 4 ) . According to the American Academy of Pediatrics , some of the obstacles to initiation and continuation of breastfeeding include insufficient prenatal education about breastfeeding , disruptive maternity care practice s , and lack of family and broad societal support ( 5 ) . Effective interventions reported to date include changes in maternity care practice s , such as those implemented in pursuit of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative ( BFHI ) design ation ( 6 , 7 ) , and worksite lactation programs ( 8) . Some of the other interventions implemented include  peer-to-peer  support  , maternal  education   , and   media marketing   ( 9 ) . Our review is based on an evidence report ( 10 ) that was requested by the Center on Primary Care , Prevention , and Clinical Partnerships at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , on behalf of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , to support the Task Force 's up date of its 2003 recommendations on counseling to promote breastfeeding ( 11 ) . Together with the Tufts Evidence -based Practice Center , these agencies jointly developed an analytic framework for study questions to evaluate the available evidence to promote and support breastfeeding ( Figure 1 ) . Five linked key questions were proposed in the analytic framework : Figure 1 . Analytic framework and study questions . 1 . What  are the effects of  breastfeeding  interventions on child and maternal health outcomes  ? 2 . What  are the effects of  breastfeeding  interventions on breastfeeding initiation , duration , and exclusivity  ? 3 . Are there harms from interventions to promote and support breastfeeding ? 4 . What are the  benefits and harms of breastfeeding on infant or child health outcomes  ? 5 . What are the  benefits and harms of breastfeeding on maternal health outcomes  ? The context ual questions regarding the effectiveness of health care system influences on interventions to  promote breastfeeding  and the potential benefits and harms related to such interventions can be answered by synthesizing the available scientific evidence for each key question . To avoid redundant work , a joint decision was made to adopt results from our earlier Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality evidence report ( 4 ) to address questions 4 and 5 on the benefits and harms of  breastfeeding for infants and mothers .  Table 1 ( 1284 ) presents a synopsis of that report 's findings on questions 4 and 5 . We address only questions 1 to 3 in this article . Specifically , we examine the effects of  primary careinitiated interventions to support or promote breastfeeding  on   child and maternal  health outcomes and breastfeeding rates  , as reported in r and omized , controlled trials ( RCTs ) from developed countries . We also document reported harms from interventions to promote and support breastfeeding . Table 1 . Findings from the Previous Systematic Review Methods Data Sources This systematic review focuses on recent evidence ( September 2001 to February 2008 ) and up date s a previous systematic review ( 85 ) conducted for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to support its 2003 recommendation on counseling to promote breastfeeding ( available at www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspsbrfd.htm ) . We search ed for English- language articles in MEDLINE , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , and CINAHL from September 2001 to February 2008 by using such Medical Subject Heading terms and keywords as breastfeeding , breast milk feeding , breast milk , human milk , nursing , breastfed , infant nutrition , lactating , and lactation . We also review ed reference lists of a related systematic review ( 86 ) for additional studies . Study Selection We included RCTs published from September 2001 to February 2008 that included  any counseling or behavioral intervention initiated from a clinician 's practice  ( office or hospital ) to improve the  breastfeeding initiation rate or duration of breastfeeding  among  healthy mothers or members of the motherchild support system ( such as partners , gr and parents , or friends ) and their healthy term or near-term infants ( 35 weeks ' gestation or 2500 g )  . We focused our review on studies conducted in developed countries ; however , because of the widespread interest in the BFHI , we also included RCTs of the BFHI that were  conducted in Brazil and Belarus .  We considered  interventions conducted by various providers ( lactation consultants , nurses , peer counselors , midwives , and physicians )  in various setting s ( hospital , home , clinic , or elsewhere ) to be eligible as long as they originated from a health care setting . We considered maternity services to be primary care for this review . We also included such  health care system interventions as staff training .  We excluded  community- or peer-initiated interventions .  Control comparisons were any usual prenatal , peripartum , or postpartum care , as defined in each study . Studies needed to report rates of breastfeeding initiation , duration of breastfeeding , or exclusivity of breastfeeding to be included . Figure 2 shows our search and selection process . Data Extraction and Quality Assessment One investigator extracted data from each study , and another confirmed them . The extracted data included study setting , population , control , description of intervention ( type , person , frequency , and duration ) , definitions of  breastfeeding outcomes  ( initiation , exclusivity , and duration ) , definitions of  health outcomes  in both mothers and children ( when provided ) , and analytic methods . Classification of Breastfeeding Interventions  Breastfeeding interventions  can include a combination of individual components , such as  structured breastfeeding education or professional or lay support .  We defined 3 categories of  breastfeeding intervention :  those that included a  component of formal or structured breastfeeding education  , those that  included a component of either professional or lay breastfeeding support  , or those that  did not include  the aforementioned components . The first 2 categories are not mutually exclusive . Table 2 shows complete details . Table 2 . Interventions to Support or Promote Breastfeeding Definitions We classified breastfeeding regimens as exclusive or nonexclusive . Studies used different definitions of exclusive breastfeeding ( no supplement of any kind , including water while breastfeeding , or occasional formula is permissible while breastfeeding ) ; we adopted all of those definitions . We classified all other breastfeeding regimens ( full , partial , mixed , or nonspecified ) as nonexclusive . We defined breastfeeding initiation as any breastfeeding at discharge or up to 2 weeks after delivery . We also defined a priori  breastfeeding duration  s of 1 to 3 months as short-term , 4 to 5 months as intermediate-term , 6 to 8 months as long-term , and 9 or more months as prolonged . We categorized studies with breastfeeding duration s shorter than 1 month as no breastfeeding in our meta-analyses . Two investigators assessed the  method ological quality  of all eligible studies by using criteria developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( 87 ) . We assigned each article a quality rating of good , fair , or poor . The criteria for quality assessment of primary studies included r and omization techniques , allocation concealment , clear definitions of outcomes , intention-to-treat analysis , and statistical methods . A third investigator review ed studies for which the first 2 investigators gave discordant quality ratings . We reached final grade s for those studies via consensus . We performed subgroup analyses to examine the effects of study quality on the meta- analysis results . We also based our qualitative conclusions on good- or fair- quality studies . Data Synthesis and Analysis We calculated the  rates of breastfeeding initiation and short-term , intermediate-term , long-term , and prolonged breastfeeding  for  both the intervention and control groups in each study .  We recorded the  exclusivity of breastfeeding  and did the same calculations for the  exclusive breastfeeding rates .  Meta- analysis and Meta-regression We used the  rate ratio ( relative risk )  as the metric of choice to quantify the effectiveness of each breastfeeding promotion intervention . We used the  DerSimonian and Laird model  for r and om-effects meta- analysis ( 88 ) to obtain summary estimates across studies . We tested for heterogeneity by using the Cochran Q test , which follows a chi-square distribution to make inferences about the null hypothesis of homogeneity ( considered significant at P < 0.100 ) and quantified its extent with I 2 ( 89 , 90 ) . The I 2 statistic ranges between 0 % and 100 % and quantifies the proportion of between- study variability that is attributed to heterogeneity rather than chance . We used r and om-effects meta-regression ( fitted with restricted maximum likelihood ) to explore whether the  effectiveness of breastfeeding interventions  depends on breastfeeding duration , provided."
"aOutdoor time is considered to reduce the risk of  developing  myopia .

A systematic review followed by a meta- analysis and a dose-response analysis of relevant evidence from literature was conducted . PubMed , EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were search ed for relevant papers .  Of the 51 articles with relevant data , 25 were included in the meta- analysis and dose-response analysis . Twenty-three of the 25 articles involved children .   Risk ratio (  RR ) for binary variables and weighted mean difference ( WMD ) for continuous variables were conducted . Mantel-Haenszel r and om-effects model was used to pool the data for meta- analysis . Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test with I2 ≥ 50 % considered to indicate high heterogeneity . Additionally , subgroup analyses ( based on participant 's age , prevalence of myopia and study type ) and sensitivity analyses were conducted . A significant  protective effect of  outdoor time   was found for  incident myopia  ( clinical trials : risk ratio ( RR ) = 0.536 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0.338 to 0.850 ; longitudinal cohort studies : RR = 0.574 , 95 % CI = 0.395 to 0.834 ) and prevalent  myopia  ( cross-sectional studies : OR = 0.964 , 95 % CI = 0.945 to 0.982 ) . With dose-response analysis , an inverse nonlinear relationship was found  with  increased time  outdoors reducing the risk of incident myopia  . Also , pooled results from clinical trials indicated  that   when outdoor time  was used as an intervention , there was  a reduced myopic shift  of -0.30 D ( in both myopes and nonmyopes ) compared with the control group ( WMD = -0.30 , 95 % CI = -0.18 to -0.41 ) after 3 years of follow-up . However , when only myopes were considered , dose-response analysis did not find a  relationship between time outdoors and myopic progression  ( R2 =  0.00064 ) .  Increased time outdoors  is effective in preventing the onset of myopia as  well as  in slowing the myopic shift in refractive error .  But paradoxically ,  outdoor  time was not effective in slowing progression in eyes that were already myopic . Further studies evaluating effect of  outdoor  in various doses and objective measurements of time  outdoors  may help improve our underst and ing of the role played by outdoors in onset and management of myopia."

"tBACKGROUND Asthma 's  cost-effectiveness  is a major consideration in the evaluation of its treatment options . Our objective was to perform a systematic review of the  cost-effectiveness  of asthma medications . METHODS We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE , EMBASE , CINAHL , Cochrane Data base of Systematic Review s , OHE-HEED , Data base of Abstract s of Review s of Effects , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , Health Technology Assessment s Data base  ,  NHS Economic  Evaluation Data base  ,  and Web of Science and  review ed  references  from  key articles between 1990 and Jan 2008 .  RESULTS  A total of 49 RCTs met the inclusion criteria .  Maintenance therapy with  inhaled corticosteroids  was found to be  very cost-effective  and in  uncontrolled asthmatics patients currently being treated with ICS  , the combination of an ICS/LABA represents a  safe , cost-effective  treatment . The simplified strategy using  budesonide  and  formoterol  for  maintenance and reliever therapy  was also found to be  as cost-effective  as  salmeterol/fluticasone plus salbutamol . Omalizumab  was found to be  cost-effective  . An important caveat with regard to the published literature is the relatively high proportion of  economic evaluations  which are funded by the manufacturers of specific drug treatments .  Future studies should be completed independent of industry support and ensure that the comparator arms within studies should include dosages of drugs that are equivalent."
"sWe aim ed to provide a summary of the existing published knowledge on the association between  adverse  birth outcomes   and the  development of  wheezing  during the first two years of life .  We carried out a systematic review of epidemiological studies within the MEDLINE data base .  Epidemiological studies on human subjects , published in English  , were included in the review . A comprehensive literature search yielded  72 studies for further consideration .  Following the application of the eligibility criteria we identified nine  studies .  A positive association and an excess  risk of wheezing  during the first two years of life were revealed for adverse birth outcomes."
"ePURPOSE This clinical practice guideline , based on a systematic review , evaluates  second-line  or  subsequent therapy  for  patients with recurrent or progressive non-small cell lung cancer .  METHODS Relevant r and omized trials and meta-analyses were identified through a systematic search of the literature . External feedback was obtained from practitioners in Ontario , and the guideline was approved by the provincial Lung Cancer Disease Site Group . RESULTS  Twenty-four r and omized trials  met the eligibility criteria . Two phase III trials demonstrated a significant benefit in  overall survival and quality of life ( QOL )  for  single-agent docetaxel .  A pooled analysis comparing docetaxel administered weekly versus three-weekly found similar  survival  between the schedules and a non-significant reduction in  febrile neutropenia  for the weekly regimen . One phase III trial found that  single-agent pemetrexed  provided similar  survival and QOL  , compared to  docetaxel .  Another phase III trial demonstrated that  oral topotecan  was non-inferior to  docetaxel  for one-year  survival rate  , although  QOL  significantly favored  docetaxel  over  topotecan . Docetaxel-based  and other  combination chemotherapy  regimens have not been shown to be superior to  single-agent docetaxel .  One phase III trial revealed a statistically significant  survival and QOL benefit  for  erlotinib  over  placebo  for  patients who were not eligible for further  chemotherapy .    Modest tumor response rates and symptom control  have been demonstrated for  gefitinib ;  however , a statistically significant  survival  benefit has not been established for  gefitinib  over  placebo .   Second-line or subsequent therapy with  single-agent docetaxel , pemetrexed  ,  or erlotinib  offers patients a significant  survival and QOL  advantage."
"eStrategies to enhance knowledge of and adherence to dietary guidelines for management of   hyperphosphatemia  in hemodialysis patients  have been studied extensively over the past decade .

"sInfluenza  vaccination  is recommended for  healthcare workers ( HCWs )  , but coverage is often low . We review ed studies evaluating interventions to increase   seasonal  influenza vaccination  coverage  in HCWs  , including a meta-regression analysis to quantify the effect of each component .  Fourty-six eligible studies were identified .  Domains conferring a high risk of bias were identified in most studies .  M and atory vaccination  was the most effective intervention component ( Risk Ratio of being unvaccinated [ RRunvacc ] = 0.18 , 95 % CI : 0.08 - 0.45 ) , followed by "" soft "" m and ates such as  declination statements  ( RRunvacc = 0.64 , 95 % CI : 0.45 - 0.92 ) ,  increased awareness  ( RRunvacc = 0.83 , 95 % CI : 0.71 - 0.97 ) and  increased access  ( RRunvacc = 0.88 , 95 % CI : 0.78 - 1.00 ) . For   incentives   the difference was not significant , while for  education  no effect was observed  .  Heterogeneity was substantial ( τ(2 ) = 0.083 ) .

"CWe review ed the history and the current status of  neoadjuvant treatment  for  locally advanced rectal cancer ( LARC ) in Western countries and Japan .  The introduction of  total mesorectal excision ( TME ) and preoperative radiotherapy ( RT )  were treatment revolutions that result ed in improved local control after curative resection for  rectal cancer .  However ,  local relapses  still occur , even in the era of TME , and remain a cause of recurrence worldwide . The high rate of  distant metastasis  after curative resection remains a problem . Furthermore , the introduction of newly developed cytotoxic agents into the LARC treatment strategy continues to be an ongoing challenge . Shifting part of an  adjuvant chemotherapy ( CTx )  regimen to the preoperative period is a promising strategy . Currently , various novel methods , such as  induction CTx , consolidation CTx , concomitant administration with RT , and neoadjuvant CTx without RT  , have been attempted worldwide . Although some strategies have shown favorable short-term  outcomes  , the  long-term efficacy  of the treatments needs be evaluated . At the same time , we must investigate clinical and /or molecular biomarkers to predict the therapeutic effects of each treatment , which is the fastest route to providing ideal personalized therapy for patients with LARC."
"iObjective To perform a systematic review of the relationships between  prenatal exercise  and maternal harms including labour/delivery outcomes . Design Systematic review with r and om effects meta- analysis and meta-regression . Data sources Online data bases were search ed up to 6 January 2017 . Study eligibility criteria  Studies of all design s were included ( except case studies ) if they were published in English , Spanish or French and contained information on the population ( pregnant women without contraindication to  exercise  ) , intervention (  subjective or objective measures of frequency , intensity , duration , volume  or type of exercise  )   , comparator  ( no exercise or different frequency , intensity , duration , volume and type of exercise , alone [ “ exercise-only ” ] or in combination with other intervention components [ e.g.  ,  dietary ; “ exercise + co-intervention ” ]  ) and outcome (  preterm/prelabour rupture  of membranes  ,  caesarean section  , instrumental delivery , induction of labour , length of labour , vaginal tears , fatigue , injury , musculoskeletal trauma , maternal harms  ( author defined ) and diastasis recti ) . Results  113 studies ( n=52 858 women ) were included .  ‘ Moderate ’ quality evidence from  exercise-only  r and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) indicated a 24 % reduction in the odds of  instrumental delivery  in  women  who  exercised  compared with women who did not ( 20 RCTs , n=3819 ; OR 0.76 , 95 % CI 0.63 to 0.92 , I 2= 0 % ) . The remaining outcomes were not associated  with exercise .  Results from meta-regression did not identify a dose – response relationship  between frequency , intensity , duration or volume of exercise and labour and delivery outcomes .  Summary / conclusions  Prenatal exercise  reduced the odds of  instrumental delivery  in the  general obstetrical population .  There was no relationship between  prenatal exercise  and  preterm/prelabour rupture of membranes , caesarean section , induction of labour , length of labour , vaginal tears , fatigue , injury , musculoskeletal trauma , maternal  harms and  diastasis  recti."

"sABSTRACT This review assesses the extent of reported theory use in  electronic health weight management interventions   targeting young adults aged 18–35 years . Twenty-four eligible studies were identified .  Two independent review ers extracted data and coded for theory use using the Theory Coding Scheme . Overall , the mean  total use of theory  score was 6/23 ( SD = 5 ; Min . = 0 , Max . = 17 ) ; 17 studies were classified as having weak application of theory , five as moderate , and two as strong . The majority ( N = 18 ) of studies mentioned theory , however , most ( N = 14 ) did not report how intervention techniques related to theoretical base . No study used  theory  to select intervention recipients and only four used  theory  to  tailor intervention techniques  to recipients . Limited studies reported theory testing ( N = 6 ) and no study used intervention results to build and /or refine theory . Results indicate that  weight-related outcomes  may be enhanced when at least one or more theoretical constructs are explicitly linked to an intervention technique and when theoretical constructs are included in evaluations . Increases in theory application and reporting are needed to assist the scientific research community in systematic ally identifying which theories work , for whom , how , why , and when ; thereby delivering an advanced underst and ing of how best to apply theory to enhance intervention outcomes."
"0OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness and reporting st and ards of  psychological interventions  for improving outcomes  after total knee replacement ( TKR ) .  DESIGN Medline , Embase , and PsycINFO were search ed from inception to up to 9 May 2019 with no language restrictions applied . R and omised controlled trials ( RCTs ) assessing the effectiveness of  psychological interventions  for  short-term and long-term postoperative pain after TKR  were included . Screening , data extraction , and assessment of method ological quality were performed in duplicate by two review ers . The primary effectiveness outcome was  postoperative pain severity  and the primary harm outcome was  serious adverse events .  Secondary outcomes included  function , quality of life , and psychological well-being .  Reporting st and ards were assessed using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication ( TIDieR ) checklist for intervention reporting . RESULTS  12 RCTs were included , with a total of 1299 participants .  Psychological  interventions  comprised  music therapy  ( five studies ) ,  guided imagery and music  ( one study ) ,  hypnosis  ( one study ) ,  progressive muscle relaxation with biofeedback  ( one study ) ,  pain coping skills programme  ( one study ) ,  cognitive-behavioural therapy  ( two studies ) , and  a postoperative management programme  ( one study ) . Due to the high heterogeneity of interventions and poor reporting of harms data , it was not possible to make any definitive statements about the overall effectiveness or safety of psychology interventions for pain outcomes after TKR .  Further evidence about the effectiveness of  psychological interventions  for improving pain outcomes after TKR is needed . The reporting of harm outcomes and intervention fidelity is currently poor and could be improved . Future work exploring the impact of intervention timing on effectiveness and whether different psychological approaches are needed to address acute postoperative pain and chronic postoperative pain would be of benefit .

"sBACKGROUND Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a major contributor to subfertility , diabetes and  cardiovascular disease in women .  The role of  non-pharmacological interventions  to prevent these outcomes has been reported in many systematic review s , but robust conclusions have not been made due to variations in the scope , quality and findings of these review s. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE Our aim was to provide an overview of existing evidence on the effects of  non-pharmacological interventions  in  women with PCOS  on   fertility and non-fertility  outcomes  by a review of existing systematic review s. SEARCH METHODS We review ed systematic review s of  r and omized trials  that have evaluated the effects of  non-pharmacological interventions , such as lifestyle interventions , nutritional supplements or alternative medicine therapies  in  women with PCOS  on  fertility , endocrine , glycaemic and weight-related outcomes .  We assessed the quality of systematic review s with the AMSTAR tool , and reported the outcomes with regard to :  fertility ( live birth , clinical pregnancy , ovulation and menstrual cycle regularization ) ; endocrine outcomes ( Ferriman-Gallwey score , free and rogen index , free testosterone and total testosterone levels ) ; and glycaemic ( fasting blood insulin , fasting blood glucose , homoeostatic model assessment ) and weight-related ( BMI ) outcomes .  We assessed the strength of evidence for significant outcomes as per the grading  of recommendations  assessment , development and evaluation ( GRADE ) system . OUTCOMES We found  twelve eligible systematic review s  which  included between three ( 143 women ) and 27 r and omized trials ( 2093 women ) .  Four review s assessed the effects of  lifestyle interventions ( diet , physical activity and /or behavioural interventions ) ;  four  evaluated nutritional supplements ( one each on n-acetylcysteine , omega-3 fatty acids , inositol and vitamin D ) ;  and four studied  alternative medical therapies ( Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture )  . All of the included review s were of high quality and scored between 8 and 11 with the AMSTAR tool ( with a maximum score of 11).R and omized evidence is lacking for  live birth rate .  N-acetylcysteine  , inositol  and the  addition of alternative medicine  to ovulation induction agents show preliminary potential to  improve fertility  ( odds ratios ( OR ) for clinical pregnancy rate range from 1.99 to 4.83 ) .  Lifestyle interventions  show benefits in  improving hirsutism  ( mean difference ( MD ) : -1.01 to -1.19 ) .  Lifestyle interventions  ( MD : -1.10 to -2.02 ) , inositol ( MD : -2.1 ) and acupuncture ( MD : -1.90 to -3.43 ) all show some evidence of improvement in  glycaemic outcomes  and there is some evidence of  reduced BMI  with  lifestyle interventions  ( MD : -0.15 to -1.12 ) . All of these outcomes scored either low or very low quality of evidence on the GRADE score . WIDER IMPLICATION  S Lifestyle interventions  in  women with  PCOS appear to improve  glycaemic results , and rogenic symptoms and anthropometric outcomes .  The role of  inositol and N-acetylcysteine  in women with PCOS needs further evaluation . Large primary trials on all interventions are needed for an agreed set of core outcomes."
")Background  HIV-infected children  are at a higher risk of  Invasive Pneumococcal Disease ( IPD )  and its mortality , even in the era of antiretroviral therapy . Therefore , an effective vaccination strategy would be beneficial . To investigate the effectiveness of  Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccination ( PCV )  against IPD among  HIV-Infected and HIV-Uninfected Children  through a systematic review and meta- analysis . Methods Observational studies and r and omized trials on  7 years old or older children  were search ed in the Cochrane Library , Web of Science core collection , Embase , Medline / PubMed , and Google Scholar . Critical appraisal was done using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment form .  Effectiveness and efficacy  of at least one dose of  PCV  was investigated among children with and without HIV considering subgroups of pneumococcal serotypes . We meta-analyzed the effect sizes using r and om-effects modeling .  Results Efficacy of  PCV   was estimated as 45.0 % ( 31.2 , 56.1 ) and 52.6 % ( 25.7 , 69.8 ) among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children ,  respectively . Effectiveness of  PCV   among HIV-infected children as − 6.2 % ( − 67.6 , 32.7 ) was significantly lower than HIV-uninfected children 65.1 %  (  47.3  , 76.9 ) . Effectiveness of  PCV   among HIV-infected children for IPDs caused by vaccine serotypes was estimated as 7.7(− 66.7 , 48.9 ) , and for IPDs caused by non-vaccine serotypes was estimated as − 402.8(− 1856 , − 29.2 ) . Conclusion Unlike the evidence on the efficacy of  PCV  against IPD among both of  HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children  , its effectiveness against IPD among  HIV-infected  children is much less limited .

Studies were included if they r and omized adults with orthostatic hypotension to  droxidopa  or to control , and outcomes related to symptoms , daily activity , blood pressure , or adverse events .  Data were extracted independently by two review ers . Risk of bias was judged against the Cochrane risk of bias tool and quality of evidence measured using Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation criteria . A fixed-effects model was used for pooled analysis . RESULTS  Of 224 identified records , four studies met eligibility , with a pooled sample size of 494 .  Study duration was between 1 and 8 weeks .  Droxidopa  was effective at reducing  dizziness  [ mean difference -0.97 ( 95 % confidence interval -1.51 , -0.42 ) ] ,  overall symptoms  [ -0.52 ( -0.98 , -0.06 ) ] and  difficulty with activity  [ -0.86 ( -1.34 , -0.38 ) ] .  Droxidopa  was also effective at improving  st and ing SBP  [ 3.9 ( 0.1 , 7.69 ) ] .  Rates of adverse events  were similar between droxidopa and control groups , including supine hypertension [ odds ratio 1.93 ( 0.87 , 4.25 ) ] .   Droxidopa  is well tolerated and effective at reducing the symptoms associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension without increasing the risk of supine hypertension .

The quality of this evidence base ranged from very low to moderate quality , suggesting that we are uncertain about these effects."
"nSt and ard inactivated  influenza vaccines  are poorly immunogenic in  immunologically naive healthy young children  , who are particularly vulnerable to complications from influenza . For them , there is an unmet need for better  influenza vaccines . Oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccines  are promising c and i date s , but clinical trials yielded inconsistent results . Here , we  meta-analyze r and omized controlled trials with  efficacy  data ( 3 trials , n = 15,310 ) and immunogenicity data ( 17 trials , n = 9062 ) .  Compared with non-adjuvanted counterparts ,  adjuvanted influenza vaccines  provide a significantly  better protection  ( weighted estimate for risk ratio of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza : 0.26 ) and are  significantly more immunogenic  ( weighted estimates for seroprotection rate ratio : 4.6 to 7.9 ) in  healthy immunologically naive young children .  Nevertheless , in immunologically non-naive children ,  adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines  provide  similar protection and  are  similarly immunogenic .  These results indicate that  oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant  improves  the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines  in  healthy young children  at the first-time seasonal influenza vaccination . Here , the authors meta-analyze clinical trials comparing  adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted  influenza vaccines  in children  and find that  oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant  improves  the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines  in healthy immunologically naive children."

" There is a lack of evidence in favour of one mode of delivery over another for bronchodilators during exacerbations of COPD . We found no difference between nebulisers versus pMDI  plus spacer  regarding the primary outcomes of  FEV1 at one hour and safety .  For the secondary  outcome ' change in FEV1 closest to one hour  after dosing  '  during an exacerbation of COPD , we found a greater improvement in  FEV1  when treating with  nebulisers  than with  pMDI plus spacers .  A limited amount of data are available  ( eight studies involving 250 participants ) .  These studies were difficult to pool , of low quality and did not provide enough evidence to favour one mode of delivery over another . No data of sufficient quality have been published comparing nebulisers versus DPIs in this setting . More studies are required to assess the optimal mode of delivery during exacerbations of COPD."

" Based on a network meta- analysis involving indirect comparison of trial findings , the following observations were made for  DMARD-IR patients .  In monotherapy ,  tocilizumab  was associated with a greater  improvement in pain and self-reported disease activity  than aTNF , and was at least as efficacious regarding functional ability . The  improvements in PROs  with  aTNF , abatacept and  tocilizumab in combination with MTX were comparable .  Improvements in PROs  with  tocilizumab  as monotherapy were similar to that of  tocilizumab + MTX  , whereas aTNF as monotherapy was likely to be less efficacious than aTNF + MTX."
"gBackground :  Transcutaneous bilirubin ( TcB ) devices  are commonly used for screening of  hyperbilirubinemia in term and near-term infants not exposed to phototherapy .  However , the accuracy of  TcB  devices in  infants exposed to phototherapy  is unclear . Objectives : To conduct a systematic review of studies comparing  TcB devices  with   total serum bilirubin  ( TSB )  in  infants receiving phototherapy or in the postphototherapy phase .  Methods : MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , CINAHL and Scopus data bases  ( from inception to May 8 , 2014 )  were search ed . Additional citations were identified from the bibliography of selected articles and from the abstract s of conference proceedings . The studies were included if they compared  TcB  results with TSB in term and near-term infants during phototherapy or after discontinuation of phototherapy . Two review ers independently assessed studies for inclusion , and discrepancies were resolved with consensus . Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool . Results :  Fourteen studies were identified .  The pooled estimates  of correlation coefficients ( r )  during phototherapy were : covered sites 0.71 ( 95 % CI 0.64 - 0.77 , 11 studies ) , uncovered sites 0.65 ( 95 % CI 0.55 - 0.74 ) , 8 studies ) , forehead 0.70 ( 95 % CI 0.64 - 0.75 , 12 studies ) and sternum 0.64 ( 95 % CI 0.43 - 0.77 , 5 studies ) . Two studies also provided results as  Bl and -Altman difference plots  ( mean TcB-TSB differences -29.2 and 30 µmol/l , respectively ) . The  correlation coefficient  improved marginally in the postphototherapy phase ( r = 0.72 , 95 % CI 0.64 - 0.78 , 4 studies ) . Conclusion : We found a moderate  correlation between TcB and TSB  during phototherapy with a marginal improvement in the postphototherapy phase . Further research is needed before the use of  TcB  devices can be recommended for these setting."
"tOBJECTIVES Measurement of  fractional exhaled  nitric  oxide ( FENO )  might substitute bronchial provocation for diagnosing asthma . However , optimal FENO thresholds for diagnosing asthma remain unclear . We reanalyzed data collected for a systematic review investigating the diagnostic accuracy of  FENO measurement  to exploit all available thresholds under consideration of pretest probabilities using a newly developed statistical model . STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING  One hundred and fifty data sets for a total of 53 different cutoffs extracted from 26 studies with 4,518 participants were analyzed  with the  multiple thresholds model .  This model allows identifying thresholds at which the test is likely to perform best . RESULTS Diagnosing  asthma  might only be possible in a meaningful manner when the pretest probability of asthma is at least 30 % . In that case ,  FENO  > 50 ppb leads to a positive predictive value of 0.76 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.29 - 0.96 ] . Excluding  asthma  might only be possible , when the pretest probability of asthma is 30 % at maximum . Then , FENO < 20 ppb leads to a negative predictive value of 0.86 ( 95 % CI 0.66 - 0.95 ) .  The  multiple thresholds model  generates a more comprehensive and more clinical ly useful picture of the effects of different thresholds , which facilitates the determination of optimal thresholds for diagnosing or excluding asthma with FENO measurement."
"yBACKGROUND The effects of cancer and associated treatments have a considerable impact on the  well-being  and  quality of life  of  pediatric oncology patients .  To support children and their families ,  complementary and alternative medicines  are seen by nurses and doctors as practical to integrate to the services offered by hospitals . OBJECTIVE The purpose of this paper is to examine if the practice of  complementary and alternative medicine  ,  specifically spiritual care and treatments based on body manipulation  , is likely to improve the  health and well-being  of  children suffering from cancer .  METHOD This objective is achieved through a systematic review of the literature . The level of evidence associated with each practice of  complementary and alternative medicine  was assessed according to the method ological design used by the studies review ed . RESULTS AND  Studies review ed are of a method ological quality that could be described as fair due to the small sample size of patients and the existence of a number of biases in the conduct and analysis of these studies . However , results obtained are consistent from one study to another , allowing us to make certain recommendations . It is thus advisable to consider the introduction of  hypnotherapy  in pediatric oncology services . Based on the data collected , it is the  complementary and alternative medicine  with the most evidence in favor of effectiveness of the  well-being  of pediatric oncology patients , especially during painful procedures . It is also recommended to use  art therapy and music therapy .  Conversely , too little evidence is present to be able to recommend the use of acupuncture , chiropractic or osteopathy."
"sTo assess the effectiveness of  telephone-based interventions  for  mental illness  , a systematic search of the literature was conducted using the data bases PsycINFO and PubMed , and the search engine Google Scholar . The search identified  14 studies evaluating  telephone-based interventions  in the areas of depression ( n = 6 ) , anxiety ( n = 3 ) , eating disorders ( n = 3 ) , substance use ( n = 1 ) and schizophrenia ( n = 1 ) .  Although these studies provide evidence that   telephone interventions   can be  effective  , the few studies conducted , small sample sizes and lack of r and omized controlled trial methodology prevent firm conclusions from being drawn . The articles review ed suggest that an effective  telephone intervention  includes clearly structured therapy sessions and homework tasks . However , further evidence using large-scale , r and omized controlled trials must be obtained in order to inform government and telephone counselling agencies about the  efficacy  of telephone interventions."
"gH OW CAN WE PREDICT which diets will work for which patients or clients ? The next frontier in nutrition care is precision nutrition , which aims to personalize nutrition recommendations based not only on diet history and phenotype , but also on additional molecular factors , such as an individual ’s genotype or gene expression , microbiome , proteome , and metabolome . The fieldof nutritional genomics is oneaspect of precision nutrition and describes how the interaction between genotype and diet affects health outcomes ( nutrigenetics ) and how diet can influence gene expression ( nutrigenomics and nutritional epigenomics ) . Nutritional genomics was highlighted as the future of nutrition in a recent National Academy of Sciences workshop . In 2014 , the Academyof Nutrition and Dietetics ( Academy ) published a Position Paper and Statement regarding the use of  nutritional genomics  in nutrition practice : “ It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that nutritional genomics provides insight into howdiet and genotype interactions affect phenotype . The practical application of nutritional genomics for complex chronic disease is an emerging science and the use of nutrigenetic testing to provide dietary advice is not ready for routine dietetics practice .  Registered dietitian nutritionists  need basic competency in genetics as a foundation for underst and ing nutritional genomics ; proficiency requires advanced knowledge and skills . ” Currently , there are no evidence -based guidelines or systematic review s ( SRs ) focusing on the effect of utilizing  nutritional genomics  in nutrition practice . A recent SR and meta- analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration focused on the effect of communicating genetic risk for disease , but was not limited to nutritionfocused studies and did not examine the effect of gene disclosure associated with nutrient metabolism . Thus , an SR targeting nutritional genomics may be needed . A systematic evidence scoping review provides an opportunity to gather knowledge on a topic in order to determinewhether anSR should be conducted or whether there is already an adequate SR in this area . An evidence scoping review examines the presence and characteristics of literature on a broad topic to guide development of an SR , although findings mayalso beused to identify gaps in primary studies or to prioritize research funding . In addition , evidence scoping review s allow for improved planning of SR workload , re source allotment , and timeline . Evidence scoping review s do not determine study quality or synthesize results . To adhere to evidence -based practice st and ards , registered dietitian nutritionists ( RDNs ) require evidence that utilizing this strategy improves  nutrition-related outcomes  in patients and clients . In 2014 , this evidence was not available . However , because the field of nutritional genomics is developing rapidly , it is possible that there is adequate literature on this topic to warrant an SR to inform nutrition practice . The objective of this evidence scoping review was to identify and describe the extent , range , and nature of literature examining the effect of  utilizingnutritional genomics innutrition practice  on nutrition-related outcomes to determine the adequacy for and scope of an SR in this area . Therefore , the research question for this evidence scoping."
 Our review could not conclude whether  IDS  would improve the  survival  of  women with advanced EOC  compared with conventional treatment .  IDS  appeared to yield benefit only in the patients whose primary surgery was not performed by expert surgeons.
 .  RPSS  is a safe intervention with potential to become an adjuvant tool for upper extremity paresis rehabilitation in subjects with stroke in the chronic phase.
" Additional large and well- design ed observational studies would contribute to underst and ing the impact of disease severity and patient characteristics on the response to influenza  vaccination .  Overall , the evidence supports a positive benefit-risk ratio for seasonal  influenza vaccination  in  patients with COPD  , and supports current vaccination recommendations in this population."
">OBJECTIVE Because most  children with asthma  now use inhaled  corticosteroids  ( ICS ) , the added benefit of immunotherapy in  asthmatic children  needs to be examined . We re-assessed the effectiveness of  subcutaneous ( SCIT )  and  sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT )  in  childhood asthma  treatment focusing on studies with patient-relevant outcome measures and  children using ICS .  METHODS We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation ( GRADE ) approach to systematic ally search and appraise the evidence using predefined critical patient-relevant outcomes (  asthma symptoms , asthma control  and  exacerbations )  . We search ed to retrieve systematic review s and  r and omised controlled trials on immunotherapy for asthma in children ( 1960 - 2017 ) .  We assessed the quality of the body of evidence with GRADE criteria . RESULTS The  quality of the evidence  for SCIT was very low due to a large risk of bias and indirectness ( date d studies in children not using ICS ) .  No effect of SCIT  was found for  asthma symptoms ;  no studies reported on asthma  control  . For  asthma exacerbations  , studies favoured SCIT . We have little confidence in this effect estimate , due to the very low quality of evidence . For SLIT , quality of  the  evidence was very low due to a large risk of bias , indirectness and imprecision . The outcome  ' asthma symptoms '  could not be calculated due to lack of st and ardisation and large clinical heterogeneity . Other predefined outcomes were not reported .  The beneficial effects of immunotherapy in  childhood  asthma found in earlier review s are no longer considered applicable , because of indirectness ( studies performed in children not being treated according to current asthma guidelines with ICS ) . There was absence of evidence to properly determine the effectiveness or lack thereof of immunotherapy in asthma treatment in  children with  ICS  ."
" Although it is premature to conclude that  periodized exercise  is superior to  non-periodized exercise  for improving  health outcomes  , periodization appears to be a feasible means of prescribing exercise to  inactive adults  within an intervention setting . Further research is necessary to underst and the effectiveness of  periodizing aerobic exercise  , the psychological effects of periodization , and the feasibility of implementing flexible non-linear methods."
" There is no available evidence of the benefits of early  administration of amino acids  on  mortality , early and late growth and neurodevelopment .  There is evidence from four  r and  omised controlled trials included in this review that early  administration  of  amino acids  is associated with a  positive nitrogen balance .  The clinical relevance of this finding is not known .  Acid-base status and ammonia levels  were normal in the infants who received  amino acids  early . Given the  small number of infants in the r and omised controlled trials included  in this  review  , the clinical heterogeneity among them , and the lack of data on important clinical outcomes , there is insufficient evidence to guide practice regarding the early versus late administration of  amino acids  to infants less than 37 weeks gestation."
"dIndonesia has implemented multiple strategies to control Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 ( HPAI/H5N1 ) , including the licensure and use of multiple vaccine formulations . The continuous drift of  Indonesian HPAI/H5N1  viruses and emergence of a new clade in  2012  that became  dominant in 2016  , dem and s the assessment of commercial vaccine formulations against  Indonesian field viruses .  Seven data bases were explored to identify relevant literature reporting performance of commercial vaccines against  Indonesian HPAI/H5N1 viruses .  After method ological assessment , data were collated and analyzed to report  immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy ( VE )  to prevent respiratory and cloacal viral shedding 2-day post challenge , and death at the end of the follow-up period . Meta-analyses were performed to assess  VE consistency  of alternative formulations and to explore sources of  heterogeneity in VE .  In total ,  65 studies and 46 vaccine formulations from 13 articles  were grouped per OIE 's VE protocol s ( group 1 ) and variations of it ( groups 2,3,4 ) . We found that concurrence of vaccine-seed and challenge-viruses in a clade design ation might be a better proxy of VE than current estimates based on vaccine-homologous HI antibody titers , particularly against current fourth order clade viruses ( groups 1&2 ) . Prime-boosting was efficacious across different chicken breeds ( group 3 ) , and early vaccination may increase the risk of  death  ( group 4 ) . One Indonesian vaccine was tested against the new dominant clade , conferring consistent  protection  in chickens but not in ducks . Meta-analyses  revealed high inconsistency  (  I2≥75 % ) and inefficacy  of LPAI formulations against current field viruses , while potential sources of inconsistent VE were formulation of seed-homologous vaccines and the species vaccinated . We conclude that the VE of commercial vaccines in Indonesia changes as Indonesian HPAI/H5N1 evolve into new clades , which should warrant continuous matching between vaccine-seeds and emerging HPAI/H5N1 . Furthermore , given the characteristics of the new Indonesian dominant HPAI/H5N1 clade , further studies to confirm VE across species are warranted."
" We found no evidence to inform decisions about  exenterative surgery  for  women with recurrent cervical , endometrial , vaginal or vulvar malignancies .  Ideally , a large RCT or , at the very least , well- design ed non-r and omised studies that use multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline imbalances are needed to compare  exenterative surgery  versus medical  management  , including palliative care."
  Acupuncture  was more effective than AT in treating DES but showed high heterogeneity . Intervention differences did not influence the heterogeneity.
"  Physical rehabilitation  , comprising a selection of components from different approaches , is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke . Evidence related to dose of  physical therapy  is limited by substantial heterogeneity and does not support robust conclusions . No one approach to  physical rehabilitation  is any more ( or less ) effective in promoting  recovery of function and mobility  after stroke . Therefore , evidence indicates that  physical rehabilitation  should not be limited to compartmentalised , named approaches , but rather should comprise clearly defined , well-described , evidence d-based physical treatments , regardless of historical or philosophical origin."
"0Delays in  recovery of intestinal function  following  abdominal surgery  are associated with longer hospital stays , increased postoperative complications , and higher costs to the health care system . Studies of  acupuncture  for postoperative ileus and other postoperative issues have reported improvements . This systematic review and meta- analysis aim ed to assess whether  acupuncture  assisted recovery following surgery for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . R and omized controlled trials ( RCTs ) were identified from major English and Chinese language biomedical data bases .  Participants ( aged 18 years plus ) had received surgical resection for CRC . 22 studies ( 1,628 participants ) were included .  Five were sham-controlled . Outcomes included  gastrointestinal function recovery  ( 21 studies ) ,  recovery of urinary function  ( 1 study ) ,  postoperative abdominal distension  ( 3 studies ) , and  quality of life  ( 1 study ) . Meta-analyses found significant reductions in  time to first bowel sounds , first flatus , and first defecation  in both the sham-controlled and nonblinded studies . These results suggested that the addition of  acupuncture  following CRC surgery improved  recovery of gastrointestinal function  based on four blinded good quality RCTs ( 281 participants ) and 17 nonblinded lower quality RCTs ( 1,265 participants ) . The best available evidence was for interventions that included  electroacupuncture at the point ST36  Zusanli and there is supporting evidence for other types of  acupuncture  therapies that involve stimulation of this point . This review is registered with the following : systematic review registration in PROSPERO : CRD42017079590."
